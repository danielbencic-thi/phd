  abstract = {This paper introduces a distributed multi-robot collision avoidance algorithm based on the concept of Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVC). We propose a novel algorithm for avoiding deadlocks consisting of three stages: deadlock prediction, deadlock recovery, and deadlock recovery success prediction. Simple heuristics (such as the right-hand rule) are often used to avoid deadlocks. Such heuristics might reduce deadlock in simple configurations and sparsely populated environments, but they begin to fail in complex configurations and more densely populated environments. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using an open-source web-based multi-robot simulation. The results show that while the proposed algorithm does not eliminate the occurrence of deadlocks, it drastically reduces their occurrence, and leads to a considerable improvement in performance, especially in high-density environments. We also validate the real-world performance of the proposed algorithm in live experiments.},

  abstract = {Incremental heuristic search algorithms reuse their previous search efforts whenever these are available. As a result, they can often solve a sequence of similar planning problems faster than planning from scratch. State-of-the-art incremental heuristic searches (such as LPA*, D* and D* Lite) work by propagating cost changes to all the states in the search tree whose g values (the costs of computed paths from the start state) are no longer optimal. This work is based on the observation that while a complete propagation of cost changes is essential to ensure optimality, the propagations can be stopped earlier if we are looking close-to-optimal solutions instead of the optimal one. We develop a framework called Truncated Incremental Search that builds on this observation and uses a target suboptimality bound to efficiently restrict cost propagations. We present two truncation based algorithms, Truncated LPA* (TLPA*) and Truncated D* Lite (TD* Lite), for bounded suboptimal planning and navigation in dynamic graphs. We also develop an anytime replanning algorithm, Anytime Truncated D* (ATD*), that combines the inflated heuristic search with truncation, in an anytime manner. We discuss the theoretical properties of these algorithms proving their correctness and efficiency, and present experimental results on 2D and 3D (x, y, heading) path planning domains evaluating their performance. The empirical results show that the truncated incremental searches can provide significant improvement in runtime over existing incremental search algorithms, especially when searching for close-to-optimal solutions in large, dynamic graphs.},

  abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are becoming more prominent in recent time because of their relevance and applications to the world today. Their ability to navigate in an environment without a need for physical or electro-mechanical guidance devices has made it more promising and useful. The use of autonomous mobile robots is emerging in different sectors such as companies, industries, hospital, institutions, agriculture and homes to improve services and daily activities. Due to technology advancement, the demand for mobile robot has increased due to the task they perform and services they render such as carrying heavy objects, monitoring, search and rescue missions, etc. Various studies have been carried out by researchers on the importance of mobile robot, its applications and challenges. This survey paper unravels the current literatures, the challenges mobile robot is being faced with. A comprehensive study on devices/sensors and prevalent sensor fusion techniques developed for tackling issues like localization, estimation and navigation in mobile robot are presented as well in which they are organised according to relevance, strengths and weaknesses.

  abstract = {The motivation for this work stems from the need to develop trajectory planning algorithms for small UAVs with limited resources. The goal is to address one of the most critical problems in UAV design, namely weight constraints. Therefore, in order to reduce the weight, small batteries are used which affect the flight duration and overall performance. To increase the operating time during a mission, frequent recharging is typically required. To solve this problem, an autonomous air-to-air take-off and landing on a drone carrier for recharging is proposed. The main objective of this study is to calculate the minimum time and thus the shortest maneuver route between the UAV and the drone carrier. To achieve this goal, the path planning algorithm is utilized through the closed-loop direct optimal control approach to calculate the optimal time, which is defined as a cost function. In addition to the optimization techniques, the singular perturbation technique (SPT) and the Hamiltonian are used to solve and refine the optimal control problem (OCP). Finally, the numerical simulation results in both open and closed loop are presented and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated.},

This framework accounts for dynamic obstacles with an event-based replanning structure and a locally reactive control layer that minimizes replanning events. The approach is demonstrated on a quadrotor navigating moving obstacles in an indoor space and stands as, arguably, one of the first demonstrations of full-online kinodynamic motion planning, with execution cycles of 3 Hz to 5 Hz.

We show that the use of neural networks results typically in two orders of magnitude reduction in computational time. Our proposed approach can be used for warm-starting onboard implementable iterative methods with an ``educated '' initial guess. This work is motivated by the application for human-machine interface in which a human provides desired trajectory through a smart-tablet interface, which has to be translated into a dynamically feasible trajectory for a quadcopter.

  abstract = {As one of today's popular research field, autonomous unmanned systems are widely used in entertainment, search and rescue, health, military, agriculture and many other fields with the advantages of technological developments. Object detection is one of the methods used for autonomous vehicles to gather and report information about its environment during mission. With the ability to detect and classify objects, an unmanned vehicle can determine the type and number of objects around it and use this information in its autonomous motion and path planning or reporting the objects with the desired features. In an indoor environment, the data coming from an optic sensor provides enough capability to detect crossing points for an intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle such as doors, windows and stairs. However, sliding objects like windows and doors need to be classified as open or closed if this information will be used for path planning. Moreover, the crossing point's width needs to be calculated to ensure it is safe to go through it. So as to provide a robust navigation plan, LIDAR sensor data can be used to ensure object classification. In this study, a method to fuse LIDAR and optic sensors data has been developed and by the way a stronger object detection method is created. A crossing point is classified as an open/closed and determined whether to have enough space or not to pass through. This method was operated in a developer board mountable in a flying quadrotor which makes it possible to use it in a real-time scenario. The success of the approach has been shown with different scenarios.},

To name a few; infrastructure inspection, traffic patrolling, remote sensing, mapping, surveillance, rescuing humans and animals, environment monitoring, and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) operations. However, the use of UAVs in these applications needs a substantial level of autonomy. In other words, UAVs should have the ability to accomplish planned missions in unexpected situations without requiring human intervention. To ensure this level of autonomy, many artificial intelligence algorithms were designed. These algorithms targeted the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of UAVs. In this paper, we described the state of the art of one subset of these algorithms: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. We made a detailed description of them, and we deduced the current limitations in this area. We noted that most of these DRL methods were designed to ensure stable and smooth UAV navigation by training computer-simulated environments. We realized that further research efforts are needed to address the challenges that restrain their deployment in real-life scenarios.},

Our contribution is two-fold: (i) we present a method that learns to represent its environment as a latent graph and leverages state reidentification to reduce the complexity of finding a good policy from exponential to linear (ii) we introduce a set of lightweight environments with an underlying discrete combinatorial structure in which planning is challenging even for humans. Moreover, we show that our methods achieves strong empirical generalization to variations in the environment, even across highly disadvantaged regimes, such as ``one-shot'' planning, or in an offline RL paradigm which only provides low-quality trajectories.},

  abstract = {We consider planning problems on Euclidean spaces of the form {$\mathbb{R}$}, where \$\textbackslash widetilde\{\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\}\$is viewed as a collection of obstacles. Such spaces are of frequent occurrence as configuration spaces of robots, where \$\textbackslash widetilde\{\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\}\$represent either physical obstacles that the robots need to avoid (e.g., walls, other robots, etc.) or illegal states (e.g., all legs off-the-ground). As state-planning is translated to path-planning on a configuration space, we collate equivalent plannings via topologically-equivalent paths. This prompts finding or exploring the different homology classes in such environments and finding representative optimal trajectories in each such class. In this paper we start by considering the general problem of finding a complete set of easily computable homology class invariants for (N\,-\,1)-cycles in ({$\mathbb{R}$}. We achieve this by finding explicit generators of the (N\,-\,1)stde Rham cohomology group of this punctured Euclidean space, and using their integrals to define cocycles. The action of those dual cocycles on (N\,-\,1)-cycles gives the desired complete set of invariants. We illustrate the computation through examples. We then show, for the case when N\,=\,2, due to the integral approach in our formulation, this complete set of invariants is well-suited for efficient search-based planning of optimal robot trajectories with topological constraints. In particular, we show how to construct an `augmented graph', \$\textbackslash widehat\{\textbackslash mathcal\{G\}\}\$, from an arbitrary graph \$\textbackslash mathcal\{G\}\$in the configuration space. A graph construction and search algorithm can hence be used to find optimal trajectories in different topological classes. Finally, we extend this approach to computation of invariants in spaces derived from ({$\mathbb{R}$}by collapsing a subspace, thereby permitting application to a wider class of non-Euclidean ambient spaces.},

We instead suggest a persistent homology approach to the problem \textendash{} a topological approach in which we seek the homology class of trajectories that is most persistent for the given probability map. In other words, we want the class of trajectories that is free of obstacles over the largest range of threshold values. In order to make this problem tractable and practical, we use homology in Z2 coefficients (instead of the standard Z coefficients), and describe how graph search-based algorithms can be used to find trajectories in different homology classes.

In the present work, we develop a compact way of representing homotopy classes and propose an efficient method of graph search-based optimal path planning with constraints on homotopy classes.

The problem of exploring/finding the different homotopy classes in an environment and the problem of finding least-cost paths restricted to a specific homotopy class (or not belonging to certain homotopy classes) arises frequently in such applications as predicting paths for unpredictable entities and deployment of multiple agents for efficient exploration of an environment. In [Bhattacharya, Kumar, Likhachev, AAAI 2010] we have shown how homotopy classes of trajectories on a two-dimensional plane with obstacles can be classified and identified using the Cauchy Integral Theorem and the Residue Theorem from Complex Analysis. In more recent work [Bhattacharya, Likhachev, Kumar, RSS 2011] we extended this representation to three-dimensional spaces by exploiting certain laws from the Theory of Electromagnetism (Biot-Savart law and Ampere's Law) for representing and identifying homotopy classes in three dimensions in an efficient way. Using such a representation, we showed that homotopy class constraints can be seamlessly weaved into graph search techniques for determining optimal path constrained to certain homotopy classes or forbidden from others, as well as for exploring different homotopy classes in an environment.

This problem is motivated by the use of boats with booms in skimming operations for cleaning oil spills or removing debris on the surface of the water. The goal in this paper is to automate the task of separating the objects of interest from a collection of objects by manipulating them with cables that are actuated only at the ends, and then transporting them to specified destinations. Because the cable is flexible, the shape of the cable must be explicitly modeled in the problem. Further, the robots must cooperatively plan motions to achieve the required cable shape and gross position/orientation to separate the objects of interest and then transport them as specified. The theoretical foundation for the problem is derived from topological invariants, homology and homotopy. We first derive the necessary topological conditions for achieving the desired separation of objects. We then propose a distributed search-based planning technique for finding optimal robot trajectories for separation and transportation. We demonstrate the applicability of this method using a dynamic simulation platform with explicit models of the cable dynamics, the contact between the cable and one or more objects, and the surface drag on the cable and on the objects. We also demonstrate the working of the proposed algorithm on an experimental platform consisting of a system of two cooperating autonomous surface vessels and stationary/anchored objects.},

In the standard formulation, a generalized plan is a mapping from feature or observation histories into actions, assuming that the instances share a common pool of features and actions. This assumption, however, excludes the standard relational planning domains where actions and objects change across instances. In this work, we extend the standard formulation of generalized planning to such domains. This is achieved by projecting the actions over the features, resulting in a common set of abstract actions which can be tested for soundness and completeness, and which can be used for generating general policies such as ``if the gripper is empty, pick the clear block above x and place it on the table'' that achieve the goal clear(x) in any Blocksworld instance. In this policy, ``pick the clear block above x'' is an abstract action that may represent the action Unstack(a, b) in one situation and the action Unstack(b, c) in another. Transformations are also introduced for computing such policies by means of fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planners. The value of generalized representations for learning general policies is also discussed.},

Conventional heuristics derive cost-to-go estimates by reasoning about a tentative and usually infeasible path, from the current node to the target. CPD-based heuristics derive cost-to-go estimates by computing a concrete and usually feasible path. We exploit such paths to bound the optimal solution, not just from below but also from above.

Consider the example of a set of candidate paths in an environment that is the result of a forward search tree built over a set of actions or behaviors. The tree is precomputed and stored in memory to be used online to compute collision-free paths from the root of the tree to a particular goal node. In general, such a set of paths may be quite large, growing exponentially in the depth of the search tree. In practice, however, many of these paths may be close together and could be pruned without a loss to the overall problem of path-finding. The best such pruning for a given resulting tree size is the one that maximizes path diversity, which is quantified as the probability of the survival of paths, averaged over all possible obstacle environments. We formalize this notion and provide formulas for computing it exactly. We also present experimental results for two approximate algorithms for path set reduction that are efficient and yield desirable properties in terms of overall path diversity. The exact formulas and approximate algorithms generalize to the computation and maximization of spatio-temporal diversity for trajectories.},

Finding aggressive but dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments requires trajectory optimization and state estimation in the full state space of the vehicle, which is usually computationally infeasible on realistic timescales for real vehicles and sensors. We first build on previous work of van Nieuwstadt and Murray and Mellinger and Kumar, to show how a search process can be coupled with optimization in the output space of a differentially flat vehicle model to find aggressive trajectories that utilize the full maneuvering capabilities of a quadrotor. We further extend this work to vehicles with complex, Dubins-type dynamics and present a novel trajectory representation called a ``Dubins\textendash Polynomial trajectory'', which allows us to optimize trajectories for fixed-wing vehicles. To provide accurate state estimation for aggressive flight, we show how the Gaussian particle filter can be extended to allow laser rangefinder localization to be combined with a Kalman filter. This formulation allows similar estimation accuracy to particle filtering in the full vehicle state but with an order of magnitude more efficiency. We conclude with experiments demonstrating the execution of quadrotor and fixed-wing trajectories in cluttered environments.

The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM and consider future directions. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation.

The key to achieve haze removal is to estimate a medium transmission map for an input hazy image. In this paper, we propose a trainable end-to-end system called DehazeNet, for medium transmission estimation. DehazeNet takes a hazy image as input, and outputs its medium transmission map that is subsequently used to recover a haze-free image via atmospheric scattering model. DehazeNet adopts Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based deep architecture, whose layers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors in image dehazing. Specifically, layers of Maxout units are used for feature extraction, which can generate almost all haze-relevant features. We also propose a novel nonlinear activation function in DehazeNet, called Bilateral Rectified Linear Unit (BReLU), which is able to improve the quality of recovered haze-free image. We establish connections between components of the proposed DehazeNet and those used in existing methods. Experiments on benchmark images show that DehazeNet achieves superior performance over existing methods, yet keeps efficient and easy to use.},

Corridor planning utilizes a modified A* algorithm for waypoint generation in conjunction with a logistic curve based path for smoothly connecting these waypoints while accounting for curvature limits of individual paths. Waypoint heading angles are optimized to find minimum length corridor. The work provides an optimal solution of corridor planning with the capability of accommodating multiple UAVs simultaneously.},

  abstract = {A prerequisite for autonomous robot navigation is the extraction of a path that is both efficient and safe in terms of collision. Towards this end, the paper in hand presents a novel local path planning method, incorporating the support vector machines (SVM) theory. The original SVM based module exploits a 2D map of points which are considered to be obstacles, so as to culminate in a collision free path. A unique attribute of the proposed SVM based local path planning algorithm is that it considers the consecutive positions of the global path trajectory, the embodiment of the robot and clusters the obstacles accordingly. Thus, the derived trajectory is a physically constrained path inasmuch as it considers the maximum margin notion of the SVM theory. Instead of providing a purely theoretical approach for local planning assessed using only artificial data, we integrate our local planner into an autonomous navigation system which is evaluated in real-world scenarios in order to show its efficacy. The latter framework firstly constructs a global 3D metric map of the perceived environment and then it converts it into a 2D map upon which a global path planner unrolls. The global map grows incrementally, by registering the collected point clouds over the robot's route towards a goal position. Moreover, the navigation is supported by an obstacle detection strategy based on v-disparity images. The system \textendash{} and, consequently, the presented local path planner \textendash{} was evaluated in long range outdoors scenarios, navigating successfully within congestive environments.},

To date, the most successful approaches for dealing with multi-goal, sparse reward environments have been model-free RL algorithms. In this work we propose PlanGAN, a model-based algorithm specifically designed for solving multi-goal tasks in environments with sparse rewards. Our method builds on the fact that any trajectory of experience collected by an agent contains useful information about how to achieve the goals observed during that trajectory. We use this to train an ensemble of conditional generative models (GANs) to generate plausible trajectories that lead the agent from its current state towards a specified goal. We then combine these imagined trajectories into a novel planning algorithm in order to achieve the desired goal as efficiently as possible. The performance of PlanGAN has been tested on a number of robotic navigation/manipulation tasks in comparison with a range of model-free reinforcement learning baselines, including Hindsight Experience Replay. Our studies indicate that  PlanGAN can achieve comparable performance whilst being around 4-8 times more sample efficient.},

In fact, it has been shown that the correlation between the heuristic function and the true costto-goal significantly affects the efficiency of the search, when used with a large weight on the heuristics. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the problem of computing heuristics that explicitly aim to minimize the amount of search efforts in finding a feasible plan. The key observation we exploit is that while heuristics tries to guide the search along what looks like an optimal path towards the goal, there are other paths that are clearly sub-optimal yet are much easier to compute. For example, in motion planning domains like footstep-planning for humanoids, a heuristic that guides the search along a path away from obstacles is less likely to encounter local minima compared with the heuristics that guides the search along an optimal but close-to-obstacles path. We utilize this observation to define the concept of conservative heuristics and propose a simple algorithm for computing such a heuristic function. Experimental analysis on (1) humanoid footstep planning (simulation), (2) path planning for a UAV (simulation), and a real-world experiment in footstep-planning for a NAO robot shows the utility of the approach.},

However, planning a shorter path with less computing time is contradictory. To address this problem, we present a framework with the map planner and point cloud planner running in parallel in this paper. The map planner determines the initial path using the improved jump point search method on the 2D map, and then it tries to optimize the path by considering a possible shorter 3D path. The point cloud planner is executed at a high frequency to generate the motion primitives. It makes the drone follow the solved path and avoid the suddenly appearing obstacles nearby. Thus, vehicles can achieve a short trajectory while reacting quickly to the intruding obstacles. We demonstrate fully autonomous quadrotor flight tests in unknown and complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles to validate the proposed method. In simulation and hardware experiments, the proposed framework shows satisfactorily comprehensive performance.},

Through the combination of sampling-based planning, a Rapidly Exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) and an efficient kinodynamic motion planner through machine learning, we propose an efficient solution to long-range planning for kinodynamic motion planning. First, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn an obstacle-avoiding policy that maps a robot's sensor observations to actions, which is used as a local planner during planning and as a controller during execution. Second, we train a reachability estimator in a supervised manner, which predicts the RL policy's time to reach a state in the presence of obstacles. Lastly, we introduce RL-RRT that uses the RL policy as a local planner, and the reachability estimator as the distance function to bias tree-growth towards promising regions. We evaluate our method on three kinodynamic systems, including physical robot experiments. Results across all three robots tested indicate that RL-RRT outperforms state of the art kinodynamic planners in efficiency, and also provides a shorter path finish time than a steering function free method. The learned local planner policy and accompanying reachability estimator demonstrate transferability to the previously unseen experimental environments, making RL-RRT fast because the expensive computations are replaced with simple neural network inference.},

The Euclidean distance between any two nodes in this space approximates the length of the shortest path between them in the given graph. Later, at runtime, a shortest path between any two nodes can be computed with an A* search using the Euclidean distances as heuristic. Our preprocessing algorithm, called FastMap, is inspired by the data-mining algorithm of the same name and runs in near-linear time. Hence, FastMap is orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches that produce a Euclidean embedding using Semidefinite Programming. FastMap also produces admissible and consistent heuristics and therefore guarantees the generation of shortest paths. Moreover, FastMap applies to general undirected graphs for which many traditional heuristics, such as the Manhattan Distance heuristic, are not well defined. Empirically, we demonstrate that A* search using the FastMap heuristic is competitive with A* search using other state-of-the-art heuristics, such as the Differential heuristic.},

Given a set of trajectories sampled from a space we construct a basis for compression whose elements correspond to paths in the space which are topologically distinct. This is achieved by computing a canonical representative for each element in a generating set for the first homology group and decomposing these representatives into a set of distinct paths. Trajectory compression is subsequently accomplished through representation in terms of this basis. Robustness with respect to outliers is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist in the super-level sets of the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) above a threshold. Robustness with respect to small scale topological artifacts is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist for a sufficient range in the super-level sets. We demonstrate this approach to trajectory compression in the context of a large set of crowd-sourced GPS trajectories captured in the city of Chicago. On this set, the compression method achieves a mean geometrical accuracy of 108 meters with a compression ratio of over 12.},

In this paper, we study tie-breaking strategies for A{${_\ast}$}. We analyze common strategies from the literature and prove that they do not have optimal expansion. We propose a novel tie-breaking strategy using cost adaptation that has always optimal expansion. We experimentally analyze the performance of A{${_\ast}$} using several tie-breaking strategies on domains from the IPC and zero-cost domains. Our best strategy solves significantly more instances than the standard method in the literature and more than the previous state-of-the-art strategy. Our analysis improves the understanding of how to develop effective tie-breaking strategies and our results also improve the state-of-the-art of tie-breaking strategies for A{${_\ast}$}.},

However, the connections among these abstraction works remain vague. Thus, to facilitate a deep understanding and further exploration of abstraction approaches for generalized planning, it is important to develop a uniform abstraction framework for generalized planning. Recently, Banihashemi et al. proposed an agent abstraction framework based on the situation calculus. However, expressiveness of such an abstraction framework is limited. In this paper, by extending their abstraction framework, we propose a uniform abstraction framework for generalized planning. We formalize a generalized planning problem as a triple of a basic action theory, a trajectory constraint, and a goal. Then we define the concepts of sound abstractions of a generalized planning problem. We show that solutions to a generalized planning problem are nicely related to those of its sound abstractions. We also define and analyze the dual notion of complete abstractions. Finally, we review some important abstraction works for generalized planning and show that they can be formalized in our framework.},

We compare Theta* against both Field D*, the only other variant of A* that propagates information along grid edges without constraining the paths to grid edges, and A* with post-smoothed paths.

To avoid the non-convex constraints normally required for obstacle-avoidance, we perform a mixed-integer optimization in which polynomial trajectories are assigned to convex regions which are known to be obstacle-free. Prior approaches have used the faces of the obstacles themselves to define these convex regions. We instead use IRIS, a recently developed technique for greedy convex segmentation [1], to pre-compute convex regions of safe space. This results in a substantially reduced number of integer variables, which improves the speed with which the optimization can be solved to its global optimum, even for tens or hundreds of obstacle faces. In addition, prior approaches have typically enforced obstacle avoidance at a finite set of sample or knot points. We introduce a technique based on sums-of-squares (SOS) programming that allows us to ensure that the entire piecewise polynomial trajectory is free of collisions using convex constraints. We demonstrate this technique in 2D and in 3D using a dynamical model in the Drake toolbox for Matlab [2].},

  abstract = {Flying robots require a combination of accuracy and low latency in their state estimation in order to achieve stable and robust flight. However, due to the power and payload constraints of aerial platforms, state estimation algorithms must provide these qualities under the computational constraints of embedded hardware. Cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) satisfy these power and payload constraints, so visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithms are popular choices for state estimation in these scenarios, in addition to their ability to operate without external localization from motion capture or global positioning systems. It is not clear from existing results in the literature, however, which VIO algorithms perform well under the accuracy, latency, and computational constraints of a flying robot with onboard state estimation. This paper evaluates an array of publicly-available VIO pipelines (MSCKF, OKVIS, ROVIO, VINS-Mono, SVO+MSF, and SVO+GTSAM) on different hardware configurations, including several single-board computer systems that are typically found on flying robots. The evaluation considers the pose estimation accuracy, per-frame processing time, and CPU and memory load while processing the EuRoC datasets, which contain six degree of freedom (6DoF) trajectories typical of flying robots. We present our complete results as a benchmark for the research community.},

We propose two metrics: (1) a naive application of local planning, a common subroutine of sampling-based motion planning, and (2) a novel approach that reasons about the topologically distinct portions of the workspace that a path visits. We present three applications of our metric to demonstrate its use and effectiveness: extracting topologically distinct paths from an existing roadmap, comparing paths for robot manipulators, and improving the computational efficiency of an existing sampling-based method, Path Deformation Roadmaps (PDRs), by over two orders of magnitude. We explore the trade-off between quality and computational efficiency in the proposed metrics.},

A local model-based approximate dynamic programming method is implemented to approximate the value function in a local neighborhood of the agent. By performing local approximations, prior knowledge of the locations of avoidance regions is not required. To alleviate the a priori knowledge of the number of avoidance regions in the operating domain, an extension is provided that modifies the value function approximation. The developed feedback-based motion planning strategy guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the approximated control policy to the optimal policy while also ensuring the agent remains outside avoidance regions. Simulations are included to demonstrate the preliminary development for a kinematic unicycle and generic nonlinear system. Results from three experiments are also presented to illustrate the performance of the developed method, where a quadcopter achieves approximate optimal regulation while avoiding three mobile obstacles. To demonstrate the developed method, known avoidance regions are used in the first experiment, unknown avoidance regions are used in the second experiment, and an unknown time-varying obstacle directed by a remote pilot is included in the third experiment.},

  abstract = {The ability to plan a multiple-target path that goes through places considered important is desirable for autonomous mobile robots that perform tasks in industrial environments. This characteristic is necessary for inspection robots that monitor the critical conditions of sectors in thermal, nuclear, and hydropower plants. This ability is also useful for applications such as service at home, victim rescue, museum guidance, land mine detection, and so forth. Multiple-target collision-free path planning is a topic that has not been very studied because of the complexity that it implies. Usually, this issue is left in second place because, commonly, it is solved by segmentation using the point-to-point strategy. Nevertheless, this approach exhibits a poor performance, in terms of path length, due to unnecessary turnings and redundant segments present in the found path. In this paper, a multiple-target method based on homotopy continuation capable to calculate a collision-free path in a single execution for complex environments is presented. This method exhibits a better performance, both in speed and efficiency, and robustness compared to the original Homotopic Path Planning Method (HPPM). Among the new schemes that improve their performance are the Double Spherical Tracking (DST), the dummy obstacle scheme, and a systematic criterion to a selection of repulsion parameter. The case studies show its effectiveness to find a solution path for office-like environments in just a few milliseconds, even if they have narrow corridors and hundreds of obstacles. Additionally, a comparison between the proposed method and sampling-based planning algorithms (SBP) with the best performance is presented. Furthermore, the results of case studies show that the proposed method exhibits a better performance than SBP algorithms for execution time, memory, and in some cases path length metrics. Finally, to validate the feasibility of the paths calculated by the proposed planner; two simulations using the pure-pursuit controlled and differential drive robot model contained in the Robotics System Toolbox of MATLAB are presented.},

  abstract = {Motion planning is critical to realize the autonomous operation of mobile robots. As the complexity and randomness of robot application scenarios increase, the planning capability of the classical hierarchical motion planners is challenged. With the development of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based motion planner has gradually become a research hotspot due to its several advantageous features. DRL-based motion planner is model-free and does not rely on the prior structured map. Most importantly, DRL-based motion planner achieves the unification of the global planner and the local planner. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of various motion planning methods. First, we summarize the representative and state-of-the-art works for each submodule of the classical motion planning architecture and analyze their performance features. Subsequently, we concentrate on summarizing RL-based motion planning approaches, including motion planners combined with RL improvements, map-free RL-based motion planners, and multi-robot cooperative planning methods. Last but not least, we analyze the urgent challenges faced by these mainstream RL-based motion planners in detail, review some state-of-the-art works for these issues, and propose suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {To operate effectively in the real world, agents should be able to act from high-dimensional raw sensory input such as images and achieve diverse goals across long time-horizons.  Current deep reinforcement and imitation learning methods can learn directly from high-dimensional inputs but do not scale well to long-horizon tasks. In contrast, classical graphical methods like A* search are able to solve long-horizon tasks, but assume that the state space is abstracted away from raw sensory input. Recent works have attempted to combine the strengths of deep learning and classical planning; however, dominant methods in this domain are still quite brittle and scale poorly with the size of the environment. We introduce Sparse Graphical Memory (SGM), a new data structure that stores states and feasible transitions in a sparse memory. SGM aggregates states according to a novel two-way consistency objective, adapting classic state aggregation criteria to goal-conditioned RL: two states are redundant when they are interchangeable both as goals and as starting states. Theoretically, we prove that merging nodes according to two-way consistency leads to an increase in shortest path lengths that scales only linearly with the merging threshold. Experimentally, we show that SGM significantly outperforms current state of the art methods on long horizon, sparse-reward visual navigation tasks. Project video and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/sparse-graphical-memory.},

In an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that our system is able to navigate in previously unknown environments at absolute scale without requiring artificial markers or external sensors.

Efficient algorithms are presented for computing the survivability criterion and for selecting a subset of paths that optimize survivability from a larger collection. The algorithms are implemented and solutions are illustrated for two different systems. Chi-square tests are used to show uniform coverage obtained by using the computed paths in a simple breadth-first search. Random obstacle placement is used to show superior robustness of these primitives compared to uniform sampling of the control space.},

Planning algorithms effectively reason over long horizons, but assume access to a local policy and distance metric over collision-free paths. Reinforcement learning excels at learning policies and relative values of states, but fails to plan over long horizons. Despite the successes of each method on various tasks, long horizon, sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional observations remain exceedingly challenging for both planning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Frustratingly, these sorts of tasks are potentially the most useful, as they are simple to design (a human only need to provide an example goal state) and avoid injecting bias through reward shaping. We introduce a general-purpose control algorithm that combines the strengths of planning and reinforcement learning to effectively solve these tasks. Our main idea is to decompose the task of reaching a distant goal state into a sequence of easier tasks, each of which corresponds to reaching a particular subgoal. We use goal-conditioned RL to learn a policy to reach each waypoint and to learn a distance metric for search. Using graph search over our replay buffer, we can automatically generate this sequence of subgoals, even in image-based environments. Our algorithm, search on the replay buffer (SoRB), enables agents to solve sparse reward tasks over hundreds of steps, and generalizes substantially better than standard RL algorithms.},

As a result, even the `op-4 2 timal ' grid planners produce unnatural, suboptimal paths for the agent to traverse. Our approach uses linear interpolation during planning to calculate accurate path cost estimates for arbitrary positions within each grid cell and to produce paths with a range of continuous headings. Consequently, it is particularly well suited to planning smooth, least-cost trajectories for mobile robots. In this paper, we present a number of applications and results, a comparison to related algorithms, and several implementations on real robotic systems. 1},

This fallback allows us to use much sparser roadmaps. Furthermore, we investigate using an approximate Reeb graph to capture the topologypersistent features of the past solutions of the problem utilising this sparsity. We evaluate DRM-connect with a Reeb graph on reaching tasks, and we compare it to state-of-the-art methods. We show that the proposed method outperforms both RRTconnect and BKPIECE algorithms in the number of collision checks required and we show that our method has the potential to scale to systems with higher number degrees of freedom.},

These heuristics are weighted sums of state features that capture the number of objects satisfying a certain first-order logic property in any given state. These features have a meaningful interpretation and generalize naturally to the whole domain. Additionally, we present an approach based on mixed integer linear programming to compute such heuristics automatically from the observation of small training instances. We develop two variations of the approach that progressively refine the heuristic as new states are encountered. We illustrate the approach empirically on a number of standard domains, where we show that the generated heuristics will correctly generalize to all possible instances.},

  abstract = {Motion planning is an extremely well-studied problem in the robotics community, yet existing work largely falls into one of two categories: computationally efficient but with few if any safety guarantees, or able to give stronger guarantees but at high computational cost. This work builds on a recent development called FaSTrack in which a slow offline computation provides a modular safety guarantee for a faster online planner. We introduce the notion of ``meta-planning'' in which a refined offline computation enables safe switching between different online planners. This provides autonomous systems with the ability to adapt motion plans to a priori unknown environments in real-time as sensor measurements detect new obstacles, and the flexibility to maneuver differently in the presence of obstacles than they would in free space, all while maintaining a strict safety guarantee. We demonstrate the meta-planning algorithm both in simulation and in hardware using a small Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor.},

  abstract = {We propose a new deep network architecture for removing rain streaks from individual images based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Inspired by the deep residual network (ResNet) that simplifies the learning process by changing the mapping form, we propose a deep detail network to directly reduce the mapping range from input to output, which makes the learning process easier. To further improve the de-rained result, we use a priori image domain knowledge by focusing on high frequency detail during training, which removes background interference and focuses the model on the structure of rain in images. This demonstrates that a deep architecture not only has benefits for high-level vision tasks but also can be used to solve low-level imaging problems. Though we train the network on synthetic data, we find that the learned network generalizes well to real-world test images. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures. We discuss applications of this structure to denoising and JPEG artifact reduction at the end of the paper.},

In this paper we provide a comparative study of a number of these techniques, all implemented in a single system and run on the same test scenes and on the same computer. In particular we compare collision checking techniques, basic sampling techniques, and node adding techniques.

  abstract = {Path planning is often a high-dimensional computationally-expensive planning problem as it requires reasoning about the kinodynamic constraints of the robot and collisions of the robot with the environment. However, large regions of the environment are typically benign enough that a much faster low-dimensional planning combined with a local path following controller suffice. Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality that was recently developed makes use of this observation and iteratively constructs and searches a state-space consisting of mainly low-dimensional states. It only introduces regions of high-dimensional states into the state-space where they are necessary to ensure completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. However, due to its iterative nature, the approach relies on running a series of weighted A* searches. In this paper, we introduce and apply to Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality a simple but very effective incremental version of weighted A* that reuses its previously generated search tree if available. On the theoretical side, the new algorithm preserves guarantees on completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. On the experimental side, it speeds up 3D (x,y,heading) path planning with a full-body collision checking by up to a factor of 5. Our results also show that it tends to be much faster than applying alternative incremental graph search techniques such as D* to Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality.},

  abstract = {Path planning quickly becomes computationally hard as the dimensionality of the state-space increases. In this paper, we present a planning algorithm intended to speed up path planning for high-dimensional state-spaces such as robotic arms. The idea behind this work is that while planning in a high-dimensional state-space is often necessary to ensure the feasibilityof the resulting path, large portions of the path have a lower-dimensional structure. Based on this observation, our algorithm iteratively constructs a state-space of an adaptive dimensionality--a state-space that is high-dimensional only where the higher dimensionality is absolutely necessary for finding a feasible path. This often reduces drastically the size of the state-space, and as a result, the planning time and memory requirements. Analytically, we show that our method is complete and is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, within a specified suboptimality bound. Experimentally, we apply the approach to 3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading), and to a 7 DOF robotic arm on the Willow Garage\&rsquo;s PR2 robot. The results from our experiments suggest that ourmethod can be substantially faster than some of the state-of-the-art planning algorithms optimized for those tasks.},

From then on, many alternatives to the original method have been proposed with two main objectives: reducing its computational time and improving its accuracy. In this paper, we collect the main single-threaded approaches, which improve the computational time of the standard fast marching method and study them within a common mathematical framework. Then, they are evaluated using isotropic environments, which are representative of their possible applications. The studied methods are the fast marching method with the binary heap, the fast marching method with Fibonacci heap, the simplified fast marching method, the untidy fast marching method, the fast iterative method, the group marching method, the fast sweeping method, the locking sweeping method, and the double dynamic queue method.},

Scene information is received using onboard sensors and communication network systems, i.e., infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navigation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implementation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning, and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers are presented, allowing the understanding of the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years. Finally, an overview of future research direction and applications is given.},

Specifically, we consider the problem of humans and robots cooperatively searching an indoor environment in a distributed manner where we assume that each robot is equipped with sensors that are able to locate targets of interest. Rather than have humans issue explicit commands to and guide robots, we allow humans to make decisions on their own and let the robots adapt to decisions taken by the human. The main contribution of this paper is a framework in which the robots in the team respond and adapt to the behavior of the human agents in the task of exploring and clearing an indoor environment. The central idea is the assignment of robots to homotopy classes that are complementary to the classes being pursued by human agents. By the virtue of the sparse topological representation of the agent trajectories, our algorithm lends itself naturally to a distributed implementation. The framework has three advantages: it (a) ensures that robots and humans pursue different homotopy classes; (b) requires very little communication between the humans and the robots; and (c) allows robots to adapt to human movement without having to model complex human decision-making behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through a distributed implementation on a ROS (Robot Operating System) platform.},

We propose a new algorithm, TrailBlazer, able to handle MDPs with a finite or an infinite number of transitions from state-action to next states. TrailBlazer is an adaptive algorithm that exploits possible structures of the MDP by exploring only a subset of states reachable by following near-optimal policies. We provide bounds on its sample complexity that depend on a measure of the quantity of near-optimal states. The algorithm behavior can be considered as an extension of Monte-Carlo sampling (for estimating an expectation) to problems that alternate maximization (over actions) and expectation (over next states). Finally, another appealing feature of TrailBlazer is that it is simple to implement and computationally efficient.},

First, FlightGoggles provides photorealistic exteroceptive sensor simulation using graphics assets generated with photogrammetry. Second, it provides the ability to combine (i) synthetic exteroceptive measurements generated in silico in real time and (ii) vehicle dynamics and proprioceptive measurements generated in motio by vehicle(s) in flight in a motion-capture facility. FlightGoggles is capable of simulating a virtual-reality environment around autonomous vehicle(s) in flight. While a vehicle is in flight in the Flight-Goggles virtual reality environment, exteroceptive sensors are rendered synthetically in real time while all complex dynamics are generated organically through natural interactions of the vehicle. The FlightGoggles framework allows for researchers to accelerate development by circumventing the need to estimate complex and hard-to-model interactions such as aerodynamics, motor mechanics, battery electrochemistry, and behavior of other agents. The ability to perform vehicle-in-the-loop experiments with photorealistic exteroceptive sensor simulation facilitates novel research directions involving, e.g., fast and agile autonomous flight in obstacle-rich environments, safe human interaction, and flexible sensor selection. FlightGoggles has been utilized as the main test for selecting nine teams that will advance in the AlphaPilot autonomous drone racing challenge. We survey approaches and results from the top AlphaPilot teams, which may be of independent interest.

In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identifies and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We find that searching with jump points can speed up A* by an order of magnitude and more and report significant improvement over the current state of the art.},

The novelty of the proposed work is that the algorithm ensures a smooth path generation for both the collision avoidance and re-planning maneuvers for the quadrotor with very low tracking error, including optimality in path length. To validate the proposed algorithm, the generated path is tracked using a dynamic model of a quadrotor using a Lyapunov-based backstepping controller in the presence of external disturbances.},

Methods from topological data analysis, e.g., persistent homology, enable us to obtain such information, typically in the form of summary representations of topological features. However, such topological signatures often come with an unusual structure (e.g., multisets of intervals) that is highly impractical for most machine learning techniques. While many strategies have been proposed to map these topological signatures into machine learning compatible representations, they suffer from being agnostic to the target learning task. In contrast, we propose a technique that enables us to input topological signatures to deep neural networks and learn a task-optimal representation during training. Our approach is realized as a novel input layer with favorable theoretical properties. Classification experiments on 2D object shapes and social network graphs demonstrate the versatility of the approach and, in case of the latter, we even outperform the state-of-the-art by a large margin.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to generate spatial constraints for motion planning in dynamic environments. Motion planning methods for autonomous driving and mobile robots typically need to rely on the spatial constraints imposed by a map-based global planner to generate a collision-free trajectory. These methods may fail without an offline map or where the map is invalid due to dynamic changes in the environment such as road obstruction, construction, and traffic congestion. To address this problem, triangulation-based methods can be used to obtain a spatial constraint. However, the existing methods fall short when dealing with dynamic environments and may lead the motion planner to an unrecoverable state. In this paper, we propose a new method to generate a sequence of channels across different triangulation mesh topologies to serve as the spatial constraints. This can be applied to motion planning of autonomous vehicles or robots in cluttered, unstructured environments. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with other triangulation-based methods in synthetic and complex scenarios collected from a real-world autonomous driving dataset. We have shown that the proposed method results in a more stable, long-term plan with a higher task completion rate, faster arrival time, a higher rate of successful plans, and fewer collisions compared to existing methods.},

  abstract = {A defining feature of sampling-based motion planning is the reliance on an implicit representation of the state space, which is enabled by a set of probing samples. Traditionally, these samples are drawn either probabilistically or deterministically to uniformly cover the state space. Yet, the motion of many robotic systems is often restricted to "small" regions of the state space, due to, for example, differential constraints or collision-avoidance constraints. To accelerate the planning process, it is thus desirable to devise non-uniform sampling strategies that favor sampling in those regions where an optimal solution might lie. This paper proposes a methodology for non-uniform sampling, whereby a sampling distribution is learned from demonstrations, and then used to bias sampling. The sampling distribution is computed through a conditional variational autoencoder, allowing sample generation from the latent space conditioned on the specific planning problem. This methodology is general, can be used in combination with any sampling-based planner, and can effectively exploit the underlying structure of a planning problem while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of sampling-based approaches. Specifically, on several planning problems, the proposed methodology is shown to effectively learn representations for the relevant regions of the state space, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in terms of success rate and convergence to the optimal cost.},

  abstract = {A system that can fly off and touches down to execute particular tasks is a flying robot. Nowadays, these flying robots are capable of flying without human control and make decisions according to the situation with the help of onboard sensors and controllers. Among flying robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are highly attractive and applicable for military and civilian purposes. These applications require motion planning of UAVs along with collision avoidance protocols to get better robustness and a faster convergence rate to meet the target. Further, the optimization algorithm improves the performance of the system and minimizes the convergence error. In this survey, diverse scholarly articles were gathered to highlight the motion planning for UAVs that use bio-inspired algorithms. This study will assist researchers in understanding the latest work done in the motion planning of UAVs through various optimization techniques. Moreover, this review presents the contributions and limitations of every article to show the effectiveness of the proposed work.},

  abstract = {Motion planners for mobile robots in unknown environments face the challenge of simultaneously maintaining both robustness against unmodeled uncertainties and persistent feasibility of the trajectory-finding problem. That is, while dealing with uncertainties, a motion planner must update its trajectory, adapting to the newly revealed environment in real-time; failing to do so may involve unsafe circumstances. Many existing planning algorithms guarantee these by maintaining the clearance needed to perform an emergency brake, which is itself a robust and persistently feasible maneuver. However, such maneuvers are not applicable for systems in which braking is impossible or risky, such as fixed-wing aircraft. To that end, we propose a real-time robust planner that recursively guarantees persistent feasibility without any need of braking. The planner ensures robustness against bounded uncertainties and persistent feasibility by constructing a loop of sequentially composed funnels, starting from the receding horizon local trajectory's forward reachable set. We implement the proposed algorithm for a robotic car tracking a speed-fixed reference trajectory. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can be run at faster than 16 Hz, while successfully keeping the system away from entering any dead end, to maintain safety and feasibility.},

This design enables us to incorporate high-level semantic features with other feature maps at different scales to enrich location information and reduce computational time. In addition, a refinement stage based on recently introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed to further improve the visual quality of the resulting snow-removed images and make a refined image and a clean image indistinguishable by a computer vision algorithm to avoid the potential perturbations of machine interpretation. Finally, atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) is adopted to probe features at multiple scales and further boost the performance.

  abstract = {Deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and enhancement, but are they still competitive when there is a lack of paired training data? As one such example, this paper explores the low-light image enhancement problem, where in practice it is extremely challenging to simultaneously take a low-light and a normal-light photo of the same visual scene. We propose a highly effective unsupervised generative adversarial network, dubbed EnlightenGAN, that can be trained without low/normal-light image pairs, yet proves to generalize very well on various real-world test images. Instead of supervising the learning using ground truth data, we propose to regularize the unpaired training using the information extracted from the input itself, and benchmark a series of innovations for the low-light image enhancement problem, including a global-local discriminator structure, a self-regularized perceptual loss fusion, and attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments, our proposed approach outperforms recent methods under a variety of metrics in terms of visual quality and subjective user study. Thanks to the great flexibility brought by unpaired training, EnlightenGAN is demonstrated to be easily adaptable to enhancing real-world images from various domains.

  abstract = {Adverse weather conditions such as snow, fog or heavy rain greatly reduce the visual quality of outdoor surveillance videos. Video quality enhancement can improve the visual quality of surveillance videos providing clearer images with more details. Existing work in this area mainly focuses on quality enhancement for high resolution videos or still images, but few algorithms are developed for enhancing surveillance videos, which normally have low resolution, high noise and compression artifacts. In addition, for snow or rain conditions, the image quality of near-filed view is degraded by the obscuration of apparent snowflakes and raindrops, while the quality of far field view is degraded by the obscuration of fog-like snowflakes or raindrops. Very few video quality enhancement algorithms have been developed to handle both problems. In this paper, we propose a novel video quality enhancement algorithm for see-through snow, fog or heavy rain. The proposed algorithm has two major steps: 1. the near-field enhancement algorithm identifies obscuration pixels by snow or rain in the near-field view and removes these pixels as snowflakes or rain drops; different from state-of-the-art methods, the algorithm in this step can detect snowflakes on foreground object and background, and choose different methods to fill in the removed regions. 2. the far-field enhancement algorithm restores the image's contrast information not only to reveal more details in the far-field view but also to enhance the overall image's quality; in this step, the proposed algorithm adaptively enhances the global and local contrast, which is inspired on the human visual system, and accounts for the perceptual sensitivity to noise, compression artifacts, and the texture of image content. From our extensive testing, the proposed approach significantly improves the visual quality of surveillance videos by removing snow/fog/rain effects.},

Knowledge of robot homotopic groups gives information regarding the obstacle structure and enables timely computation of optimal path. Making a roadmap which misses out on a single homotopic group in such approaches may lead to sub-optimal decisions. E.g. one may prefer to go through a very narrow corridor if that reduces the path length significantly, but not if the resulting path has too many such narrow segments. Similarly knowledge of homotopic groups may enable distribution and scheduling of robots across homotopic groups for decentralized planning of multiple robots. For an unstructured robot environment, sampling based approaches give an insight into homotopic groups. The aim of the work is to make a homotopy conscious Probabilistic Roadmap such that the roadmap is capable of generating paths corresponding to as many homotopic groups as possible. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach gives the best results as compared to the other sampling techniques subject to the test scenarios run.},

Although the RRT algorithm quickly produces candidate feasible solutions, it tends to converge to a solution that is far from optimal. Practical applications favor "anytime" algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT\% committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods. We also demonstrate experimental results for an outdoor wheeled robotic vehicle.},

The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT\$\^*\$ algorithm, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.

The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts.

In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (/spl ap/150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds).},

The model is tested using the data recorded from three different missions. In each mission, adverse weather, conditions and enemy locations are introduced at random locations along the path of the mission. There are two phases to the model development. In the first phase, the Mamdani fuzzy model is used to create rules to steer the UAV along the designated mission and the rules of engagement when it encounters weather and enemy locations along and near its chosen mission. The data are gathered as UAV traverses on each mission. In the second phase, the data gathered from these missions are used to create a reverse model using a Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system based on the subtractive clustering in the data. The model has seven inputs (time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, heading direction, engage in attack, continue mission, and steer UAV) and two outputs (weather conditions and distance from the enemy). This model predicts the outputs regarding the weather conditions and enemy positions whenever UAV deviates from the predefined path. The model is optimized with respect to the number of rules and prediction accuracy by adjusting subtractive clustering parameters. The model is then fine-tuned with ANFIS. The final model has six rules and root mean square error value that is less than 0.05. Furthermore, to check the robustness of the model, the Gaussian random noise is added to a UAV path, and the prediction accuracy is validated.},

They are also often applied in special situations that would be hazardous for humans such as disposing toxic wastes or defusing bombs. Mobile robots alone however have gained much focus from researches relating optimization of their motion path planning. In this paper, a brief review on mobile robots motion path planning in unknown environment have been done based on recent founds. The paper categorizes motion path planning into two groups which is the Optimized Classic Approaches and Evolutionary and Hybrid Approaches. The optimized classic approaches represents the recent optimized motion path planning that implies the classic approaches such as A* search algorithm, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), D* and D* Lite algorithm. The evolutionary and hybrid approaches are those adapts Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as neural networks (NN), genetic algorithms (GA), fuzzy systems and reinforced learning either acting alone or as hybrids together with other algorithms. Finally a comparison between these two categories are done differentiating their advantages and disadvantages.},

  abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) have gained immense popularity for area coverage having applications such as environmental monitoring, demining, search and rescue, among others. Most of the existing studies exploring area coverage have considered only a single region, however, few recent studies have considered coverage of multiple distributed regions. One of the limitations which UAV suffers while covering distributed multiple regions is energy constraints where complete area coverage is not possible. From a strategical point of view, we propose a novel algorithm which solves a variant of area coverage problem where the UAV aims to achieve near-optimal area coverage due to path length limitation caused by the energy constraint. In this paper, a preliminary study is conducted by first formulating the problem and later on presenting a solution. The solution has been partitioned into two inter-dependent sub-problems: i) inter-region coverage, ii) intra-region coverage. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated by analysing its properties over an exhaustive set of test case scenarios and comparing it against two state-of-the-art area coverage approaches.},

The VOO algorithm uses Voronoi partitioning to guide sampling, and is particularly efficient in highdimensional spaces. The VOOT algorithm has an instance of VOO at each node in the tree.

The reachable space of the robot is restricted by the length of the cable and obstacles. The reachable space of the tethered robot can be computed by considering the topology class of the cable. However, it is computationally too expensive to compute this space a-priori. Instead, in this paper, we show how we can plan using a recently-developed variant of A* search, called Multi-Heuristic A*. Normally, the Multi-Heuristic A* algorithm takes in a fixed set of heuristic functions. In our problem, however, the heuristics represent length of paths to the goal along different topology classes, and there can be too many of them and not all the topology classes are useful. To deal with this, we adapt Multi-Heuristic A* to work with a dynamically generated set of heuristic functions. It starts out as a normal weighted A*. Whenever the search gets trapped in a local minimum, we find the proper topology class of the path to escape from it and add the corresponding new heuristic function into the set of heuristic functions considered by the search. We present experimental analysis comparing our approach with weighted A* on planning for a tethered robot in simulation.},

The unknown, yet-to-be-explored area is mapped to a single point, thus giving us a quotient space. The topological classes on the quotient space allows us to define topological classes of trajectories connecting a robot pose to the unknown region in the original configuration space. Robots explore this configuration space choosing different homology classes when confronted by obstacles or walls. We illustrate the basic idea with simulations of small teams of robots. Experiments with a single robot illustrate the applicability of the method to robots that have small sensor footprints and limited computational resources.

For stable visual navigation, MAVs should generate perception-aware paths which guarantee enough visible landmarks. Many previous works on perception-aware path planning focused on sampling-based planners. However, they may suffer from sample inefficiency, which leads to computational burden for finding a global optimal path. To address this issue, we suggest a perception-aware path planner which utilizes topological information of environments. Since the topological class of a path and visible landmarks during traveling the path are closely related, the proposed algorithm checks distinctive topological classes to choose the class with abundant visual information. Topological graph is extracted from the generalized Voronoi diagram of the environment and initial paths with different topological classes are found. To evaluate the perception quality of the classes, we divide the initial path into discrete segments where the points in each segment share similar visual information. The optimal class with high perception quality is selected, and a graph-based planner is utilized to generate path within the class. With simulations and real-world experiments, we confirmed that the proposed method could guarantee accurate visual navigation compared with the perception-agnostic method while showing improved computational efficiency than the sampling-based perception-aware planner.},

In this paper, we present a method to generate an optimal trajectory restricted to a particular homotopy class, which is specified by a given representative trajectory. The optimality is achieved by formulating the trajectory generation problem as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). We partition the configuration space into nonoverlapping cells and model each cell in the partition with integer variables and inequality constraints. We associate with any sequence of integer variables a word, so that each trajectory can be mapped to a word. We then construct a set of all words that are homotopically equivalent to a given word. For each word, we fix the integer variables of the MIQP to find the optimal time distribution in each cell, by solving a QP for each iteration, to obtain the locally optimal trajectory in the specified homotopy class. We illustrate an example of minimum acceleration trajectory generation on a plane with different homotopy class constraints.},

Secondly, the data structure is then utilized to decide between future navigation goals. This approach is compared to the class of nearest neighbor exploration algorithms and a decision theoretic approach. The algorithm is tested in a simulation study with furbished ground maps and in a real life domestic environment. The paper shows, that frontier trees exhibit a superior performance of distance traveled and the number of exploration steps compared to a nearest neighbor algorithm.},

In the existing formulation called the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP), the vehicle speed is assumed to be constant over the whole trajectory, and that does not allow adaptation of the turning radius of the trajectory between the target locations. It does not support optimization of the overall flight time of the multi-goal trajectory by exploiting higher speeds for longer turning radii. Therefore, we propose a novel problem formulation called the Variable-Speed Traveling Salesman Problem (VS-TSP) that employs time-efficient trajectories with variable speed based on a generalization of the Dubins vehicle model, allowing multiple turning radii and change of the forward speed of the vehicle. The VS-TSP allows the vehicle to slow down if high maneuverability is necessary and speed up if high-speed turns with a large radius are beneficial to the overall tour cost. Based on the evaluation results for Cessna 172 aircraft model, the proposed VNS-based algorithm with variable speed provides up to about 20 \% faster trajectories than a solution of the DTSP with a single turning radius.},

In this paper, we present a graph search based method to plan time and energy optimal paths in static and time-varying flow fields. We also use tools from topological path planning to generate optimal paths in different homotopy classes to facilitate simultaneous exploration of the environment by multi-robot teams. The proposed strategy is validated using analytical flow models, actual ocean data, and in experiments using an indoor laboratory testbed capable of creating flows with ocean-like features. We also present an alternative approach using a Riemannian metric based approximation for the cost functions in the static flow case for computing time and energy optimal paths. The Riemannian approximation results in smoother trajectories in contrast to the graph based strategy while requiring less computational time.},

  abstract = {Optimal motion planning involves obstacles avoidance where path planning is the key to success in optimal motion planning. Due to the computational demands, most of the path planning algorithms can not be employed for real-time based applications. Model-based reinforcement learning approaches for path planning have received certain success in the recent past. Yet, most of such approaches do not have deterministic output due to the randomness. We analyzed several types of reinforcement learning-based approaches for path planning. One of them is a deterministic tree-based approach and other two approaches are based on Q-learning and approximate policy gradient, respectively. We tested preceding approaches on two different simulators, each of which consists of a set of random obstacles that can be changed or moved dynamically. After analysing the result and computation time, we concluded that the deterministic tree search approach provides highly stable result. However, the computational time is considerably higher than the other two approaches. Finally, the comparative results are provided in terms of accuracy and computational time as evidence.},

While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a collision avoidance system for navigating a multicopter in cluttered outdoor environments based on the recent memory-less motion planner, rectangular pyramid partitioning using integrated depth sensors (RAP-PIDS). The RAPPIDS motion planner generates collision-free flight trajectories at high speed with low computational cost using only the latest depth image. In this work we extend it to improve the performance of the planner by taking the following issues into account. (a) Changes in the dynamic characteristics of the multicopter that occur during flight, such as changes in motor input/output characteristics due to battery voltage drop. (b) The noise of the flight sensor, which can cause unwanted control input components. (c) Planner utility function which may not be suitable for the cluttered environment. Therefore, in this paper we introduce solutions to each of the above problems and propose a system for the successful operation of the RAPPIDS planner in an outdoor cluttered flight environment. At the end of the paper, we validate the proposed method's effectiveness by presenting the flight experiment results in a forest environment.

Research activity in autonomous drone navigation has increased rapidly in the past five years, and drones are moving fast towards the ultimate goal of near-complete autonomy. However, while much work in the area focuses on specific tasks in drone navigation, the contribution to the overall goal of autonomy is often not assessed, and a comprehensive overview is needed. In this work, a taxonomy of drone navigation autonomy is established by mapping the definitions of vehicular autonomy levels, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, to specific drone tasks in order to create a clear definition of autonomy when applied to drones. A top\textendash down examination of research work in the area is conducted, focusing on drone navigation tasks, in order to understand the extent of research activity in each area. Autonomy levels are cross-checked against the drone navigation tasks addressed in each work to provide a framework for understanding the trajectory of current research. This work serves as a guide to research in drone autonomy with a particular focus on Deep Learning-based solutions, indicating key works and areas of opportunity for development of this area in the future.},

  abstract = {Combining visual and inertial measurements has become popular in mobile robotics, since the two sensing modalities offer complementary characteristics that make them the ideal choice for accurate visual\textendash inertial odometry or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While historically the problem has been addressed with filtering, advancements in visual estimation suggest that nonlinear optimization offers superior accuracy, while still tractable in complexity thanks to the sparsity of the underlying problem. Taking inspiration from these findings, we formulate a rigorously probabilistic cost function that combines reprojection errors of landmarks and inertial terms. The problem is kept tractable and thus ensuring real-time operation by limiting the optimization to a bounded window of keyframes through marginalization. Keyframes may be spaced in time by arbitrary intervals, while still related by linearized inertial terms. We present evaluation results on complementary datasets recorded with our custom-built stereo visual\textendash inertial hardware that accurately synchronizes accelerometer and gyroscope measurements with imagery. A comparison of both a stereo and monocular version of our algorithm with and without online extrinsics estimation is shown with respect to ground truth. Furthermore, we compare the performance to an implementation of a state-of-the-art stochastic cloning sliding-window filter. This competitive reference implementation performs tightly coupled filtering-based visual\textendash inertial odometry. While our approach declaredly demands more computation, we show its superior performance in terms of accuracy.},

To this end, we introduce Bidirectional Homotopy-Guided RRT (BH-RRT) that combines Bidirectional RRT (Bi-RRT) with information obtained from obstacle contours. Compared with the previous methods, BH-RRT can reflect most of the map's information with a small number of feature points, and then form a set of points. This set can provide a better local goal point in each iteration, so that the tree can grow in a more favorable direction, rather than only being affected by the goal point. Experimental results show that BH-RRT outperforms RRT, HRRT and Bi-RRT in the success rate within a limited time.},

To solve the problems of poor convergence and degradation that hinder the algorithm's ability to find the best in the later stage, a dynamic feedback horizon and an adaptive step size are introduced. On the other hand, to ensure that the planned paths are continuous in both orientation and curvature, the Bessel curve theory is introduced to smooth the planned paths. This is demonstrated through a simulation that shows the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm achieving 100\% planning accuracy, while ensuring the shortest average path in the same grid environment. Additionally, the smoothed path is continuous in both orientation and curvature, which satisfies the kinematic characteristics of the mobile robot.},

Yet UAV path planning under various safety risks, such as crash and collision, is not an easy task, due to the complicated and dynamic nature of path environments. Therefore, developing an efficient and flexible algorithm for UAV path planning has become inevitable. Aimed at quality-oriented UAV path planning, this paper is designed to analyze UAV path planning from two aspects: global static planning and local dynamic hierarchical planning. Through a theoretical and mathematical approach, a three-dimensional UAV path planning model was established. Based on the A* algorithm, the search strategy, the step size, and the cost function were improved, and the OPEN set was simplified, thereby shortening the planning time and greatly improving the execution efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, a dynamic exploration factor was added to the exploration mechanism of Q-learning to solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma of Q-learning to adapt to the local dynamic path adjustment for UAVs. The global-local hybrid UAV path planning algorithm was formed by combining the two. The simulation results indicate that the proposed planning model and algorithm can efficiently solve the problem of UAV path planning, improve the path quality, and can be a significant reference for solving other problems related to path planning, such as the reliability, security, and safety of UAV, when embedded into the heuristic function of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of video rain removal by considering rain occlusion regions, i.e., very low light transmittance for rain streaks. Different from additive rain streaks, in such occlusion regions, the details of backgrounds are completely lost. Therefore, we propose a hybrid rain model to depict both rain streaks and occlusions. Integrating the hybrid model and useful motion segmentation context information, we present a Dynamic Routing Residue Recurrent Network (D3R-Net). D3R-Net first extracts the spatial features by a residual network. Then, the spatial features are aggregated by recurrent units along the temporal axis. In the temporal fusion, the context information is embedded into the network in a ``dynamic routing'' way. A heap of recurrent units takes responsibility for handling the temporal fusion in given contexts, e.g., rain or non-rain regions. In the certain forward and backward processes, one of these recurrent units is mainly activated. Then, a context selection gate is employed to detect the context and select one of these temporally fused features generated by these recurrent units as the final fused feature. Finally, this last feature plays a role of ``residual feature.'' It is combined with the spatial feature and then used to reconstruct the negative rain streaks. In such a D3R-Net, we incorporate motion segmentation, which denotes whether a pixel belongs to fast moving edges or not, and rain type indicator, indicating whether a pixel belongs to rain streaks, rain occlusions, and non-rain regions, as the context variables. Extensive experiments on a series of synthetic and real videos with rain streaks verify not only the superiority of the proposed method over state of the art but also the effectiveness of our network design and its each component.

The core novel idea underlying the method is to define a metric for which a path of minimal length is an admissible path, that is path that respects the various constraints imposed by the environment and the physics of the system on its dynamics. To be more precise, our method takes as input a control system with holonomic and non-holonomic constraints, an initial and final point in configuration space, a description of obstacles to avoid, and an initial trajectory for the system, called a sketch. This initial trajectory does not need to meet the constraints, except for the obstacle avoidance constraints. The constraints are then encoded in an inner product, which is used to deform (via a homotopy) the initial sketch into an admissible trajectory from which controls realizing the transfer can be obtained. We illustrate the method on various examples, including vehicle motion with obstacles and a two-link manipulator problem.},

In this work, we propose a method to formulate trajectory generation as a quadratic program (QP) using the concept of a Safe Flight Corridor (SFC). The SFC is a collection of convex overlapping polyhedra that models free space and provides a connected path from the robot to the goal position. We derive an efficient convex decomposition method that builds the SFC from a piece-wise linear skeleton obtained using a fast graph search technique. The SFC provides a set of linear inequality constraints in the QP allowing real-time motion planning. Because the range and field of view of the robot's sensors are limited, we develop a framework of Receding Horizon Planning , which plans trajectories within a finite footprint in the local map, continuously updating the trajectory through a re-planning process. The re-planning process takes between 50 to 300 ms for a large and cluttered map. We show the feasibility of our approach, its completeness and performance, with applications to high-speed flight in both simulated and physical experiments using quadrotors.},

The ellipsoid model allows the quadrotor to pass through gaps that are smaller than its diameter with nonzero pitch or roll angles. Without any prior information about the location of gaps and associated attitude constraints, our algorithm is able to find a safe and optimal trajectory that guides the robot to its goal as fast as possible.

Unlike analytical methods for which the problem is explicitly defined and domain-knowledge carefully engineered into the solution, deep neural networks (DNNs) do not benefit from such prior knowledge and instead make use of large data sets to learn the unknown solution to the inverse problem. In this article, we review deep-learning techniques for solving such inverse problems in imaging. More specifically, we review the popular neural network architectures used for imaging tasks, offering some insight as to how these deep-learning tools can solve the inverse problem. Furthermore, we address some fundamental questions, such as how deeplearning and analytical methods can be combined to provide better solutions to the inverse problem in addition to providing a discussion on the current limitations and future directions of the use of deep learning for solving inverse problem in imaging.},

Effective understanding of the surrounding environment and efficient generation of an optimal collision-free path are both critical parts for solving path-planning problems. Although conventional sampling-based algorithms, such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) and its improved optimal version (RRT*), have been widely used in path-planning problems because of their ability to find a feasible path in even complex environments, they fail to find an optimal path efficiently. To solve this problem and satisfy the two aforementioned requirements, we propose a novel learning-based path-planning algorithm which consists of a novel generative model based on the conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) and a modified RRT* algorithm (denoted by CGAN-RRT*). Given the map information, our CGAN model can generate an efficient probability distribution of feasible paths, which can be utilized by the CGAN-RRT* algorithm to find an optimal path with a nonuniform sampling strategy. The CGAN model is trained by learning from ground-truth maps, each of which is generated by putting all the results of executing the RRT algorithm 50 times on one raw map. We demonstrate the efficient performance of this CGAN model by testing it on two groups of maps and comparing the CGAN-RRT* algorithm with the Informed-RRT* algorithm and conventional RRT* algorithm.},

  abstract = {Lazy search algorithms can efficiently solve problems where edge evaluation is the bottleneck in computation, as is the case for robotic motion planning. The optimal algorithm in this class, LazySP, lazily restricts edge evaluation to only the shortest path. Doing so comes at the expense of search effort, i.e., LazySP must recompute the search tree every time an edge is found to be invalid. This becomes prohibitively expensive when dealing with large graphs or highly cluttered environments. Our key insight is the need to balance both edge evaluation and search effort to minimize the total planning time. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a framework, Generalized Lazy Search (GLS), that seamlessly toggles between search and evaluation to prevent wasted efforts. We show that for a choice of toggle, GLS is provably more efficient than LazySP. Second, we leverage prior experience of edge probabilities to derive GLS policies that minimize expected planning time. We show that GLS equipped with such priors significantly outperforms competitive baselines for many simulated environments in R2, SE(2) and 7-DoF manipulation.},

A multilevel framework is proposed that provides a solution for UAM in the non-segregated airspace. The proposed method takes advantage of a prediction-based zone partitioning algorithm that minimizes high-density traffic encounters. Numerical potential fields are used for global path planning as they provide optimum standoff clearance from obstacles and high-density traffic present in the environment. In the event of low-density traffic, a simple but effective octant-based local collision avoidance strategy is used.},

This problem is particularly acute in human and animal cognition given the limited capacity of working memory, and the time pressures under which planning often occurs in the natural environment. Hierarchically organized modular representations have long been suggested to underlie the capacity of biological systems to efficiently and flexibly plan in complex environments. However, the principles underlying efficient modularization remain obscure, making it difficult to identify its behavioral and neural signatures. Here, we develop a normative theory of efficient state-space representations which partitions an environment into distinct modules by minimizing the average (information theoretic) description length of planning within the environment, thereby optimally trading off the complexity of planning across and within modules. We show that such optimal representations provide a unifying account for a diverse range of hitherto unrelated phenomena at multiple levels of behavior and neural representation.},

To ensure safe and smooth operations in frequent bad weather scenarios, image dehazing is crucial to any vehicular motion and navigation task on road or air. Moreover, the commonly deployed mobile systems are resource constrained in nature. Therefore, it is important to ensure memory, compute and run-time efficiency of dehazing algorithms. In this manuscript we propose ReViewNet, a fast, lightweight and robust dehazing system suitable for autonomous vehicles. The network uses components like spatial feature pooling, quadruple color-cue, multi-look architecture and multi-weighted loss to effectively dehaze images captured by cameras of autonomous vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed model is analyzed by exhaustive quantitative evaluation on five benchmark datasets demonstrating its supremacy over other existing state-of-the-art methods. Further, a component-wise ablation and loss weight ratio analysis demonstrates the contribution of each and every component of the network. We also show the qualitative analysis with special use cases and visual responses on distinctive vehicular vision instances, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed method in numerous hazy weather conditions for autonomous vehicular applications.},

  abstract = {Balancing the trade-off between safety and efficiency is of significant importance for path planning under uncertainty. Many risk-aware path planners have been developed to explicitly limit the probability of collision to an acceptable bound in uncertain environments. However, convex obstacles or Gaussian uncertainties are usually assumed to make the problem tractable in the existing method. These assumptions limit the generalization and application of path planners in real-world implementations. In this article, we propose to apply deep learning methods to the sampling-based planner, developing a novel risk bounded near-optimal path planning algorithm named neural risk-aware RRT (NR-RRT). Specifically, a deterministic risk contours map is maintained by perceiving the probabilistic nonconvex obstacles, and a neural network sampler is proposed to predict the next most-promising safe state. Furthermore, the recursive divide-and-conquer planning and bidirectional search strategies are used to accelerate the convergence to a near-optimal solution with guaranteed bounded risk. Worst-case theoretical guarantees can also be proven owing to a standby safety guaranteed planner utilizing a uniform sampling distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art remarkably for finding risk bounded low-cost paths in seen and unseen environments with uncertainty and nonconvex constraints.},

Monte Carlo tree search with progressive widening attempts to improve scaling by sampling from the action space to construct a policy search tree. The performance of progressive widening search is dependent upon the action sampling policy, often requiring problem-specific samplers. In this work, we present a general method for efficient action sampling based on Bayesian optimization. The proposed method uses a Gaussian process to model a belief over the action-value function and selects the action that will maximize the expected improvement in the optimal action value. We implement the proposed approach in a new online tree search algorithm called Bayesian Optimized Monte Carlo Planning (BOMCP). Several experiments show that BOMCP is better able to scale to large action space POMDPs than existing state-of-the-art tree search solvers.},

Unlike existing solutions, the presented system is integrated with ROS and the Gazebo simulator. This comprehensive approach allows simultaneous simulation of diverse aspects such as flight dynamics, onboard sensors like IMUs, external imaging sensors and complex environments. The dynamics model of the quadrotor has been parameterized using wind tunnel tests and validated by a comparison of simulated and real flight data.

Closed-form solutions for the primitives are given, which minimize a cost function related to input aggressiveness. Computationally efficient tests are presented to allow for rapid feasibility verification. Conditions are given under which the existence of feasible primitives can be guaranteed a priori . The algorithm may be incorporated in a high-level trajectory generator, which can then rapidly search over a large number of motion primitives which would achieve some given high-level goal.

  abstract = {Quadrotors can achieve aggressive flight by tracking complex maneuvers and rapidly changing directions. Planning for aggressive flight with trajectory optimization could be incredibly fast, even in higher dimensions, and can account for dynamics of the quadrotor, however, only provides a locally optimal solution. On the other hand, planning with discrete graph search can handle non-convex spaces to guarantee optimality but suffers from exponential complexity with the dimension of search. We introduce a framework for aggressive quadrotor trajectory generation with global reasoning capabilities that combines the best of trajectory optimization and discrete graph search. Specifically, we develop a novel algorithmic framework that interleaves these two methods to complement each other and generate trajectories with provable guarantees on completeness up to discretization. We demonstrate and quantitatively analyze the performance of our algorithm in challenging simulation environments with narrow gaps that create severe attitude constraints and push the dynamic capabilities of the quadrotor. Experiments show the benefits of the proposed algorithmic framework over standalone trajectory optimization and graph search-based planning techniques for aggressive quadrotor flight.},

The reference path is parameterized as a B-spline curve, which is guaranteed to entirely remain within the workspace by exploiting the local convexity property and by formulating linear constraints on the control points of the B-spline. The novelties of the paper lie in the use of the equivalent B\'ezier representation of the B-spline curve, which significantly reduces the conservatism in the local convexity bound and in the integration of these constraints into a convex quadratic optimization problem, which minimizes the curve length. The algorithm is successfully validated in both simulations and experiments, by providing obstacle-free reference paths on real occupancy grid maps obtained from the laser scan data of a mobile robot platform.},

To address this problem, most existing algorithms are based on supervised learning methods to learn an automatic photo enhancer for paired data, which consists of low-quality photos and corresponding expert-retouched versions. However, the style and characteristics of photos retouched by experts may not meet the needs or preferences of general users. In this paper, we present an unsupervised image enhancement generative adversarial network (UEGAN), which learns the corresponding image-to-image mapping from a set of images with desired characteristics in an unsupervised manner, rather than learning on a large number of paired images. The proposed model is based on single deep GAN which embeds the modulation and attention mechanisms to capture richer global and local features. Based on the proposed model, we introduce two losses to deal with the unsupervised image enhancement: (1) fidelity loss, which is defined as a {$\mathscr{l}$}2 regularization in the feature domain of a pre-trained VGG network to ensure the content between the enhanced image and the input image is the same, and (2) quality loss that is formulated as a relativistic hinge adversarial loss to endow the input image the desired characteristics. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed model effectively improves the aesthetic quality of images. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eezkni/UEGAN.},

We perform extensive simulations to show that this system performs better than the standard approach of using an optimistic global planner and also outperforms doing a single exploration step when the local planner is stuck.

Specifically, localization is performed by exploiting a scan matching approach based on a customized version of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm, while mapping is done by extracting robust line features from LIDAR measurements. A peculiarity of the line detection method is the use of the Principal Component Analysis which allows computational time saving with respect to traditional least squares techniques for line fitting.

  abstract = {The use of a policy and a heuristic function for guiding search can be quite effective in adversarial problems, as demonstrated by AlphaGo and its successors, which are based on the PUCT search algorithm. While PUCT can also be used to solve singleagent deterministic problems, it lacks guarantees on its search effort and it can be computationally inefficient in practice. Combining the A* algorithm with a learned heuristic function tends to work better in these domains, but A* and its variants do not use a policy. Moreover, the purpose of using A* is to find solutions of minimum cost, while we seek instead to minimize the search loss (e.g., the number of search steps). LevinTS is guided by a policy and provides guarantees on the number of search steps that relate to the quality of the policy, but it does not make use of a heuristic function. In this work we introduce Policy-guided Heuristic Search (PHS), a novel search algorithm that uses both a heuristic function and a policy and has theoretical guarantees on the search loss that relates to both the quality of the heuristic and of the policy. We show empirically on the sliding-tile puzzle, Sokoban, and a puzzle from the commercial game `The Witness' that PHS enables the rapid learning of both a policy and a heuristic function and compares favorably with A*, Weighted A*, Greedy Best-First Search, LevinTS, and PUCT in terms of number of problems solved and search time in all three domains tested.},

The local-minima are grouped into a local-minima tree using lower-dimensional projections specified by a user. The user can then interactively explore the local-minima tree, thereby visualizing the problem structure and guide or prevent motions.

While there are various ways to formally capture multilevel abstractions, we formulate them in terms of fiber bundles, which allows us to concisely describe and derive novel algorithms in terms of bundle restrictions and bundle sections. Fiber bundles essentially describe lower-dimensional projections of the state space using local product spaces. Given such a structure and a corresponding admissible constraint function, we can develop highly efficient and optimal search-based motion planning methods for high-dimensional state spaces. Our contributions are the following: We first introduce the terminology of fiber bundles, in particular the notion of restrictions and sections. Second, we use the notion of restrictions and sections to develop novel multilevel motion planning algorithms, which we call QRRT* and QMP*. We show these algorithms to be probabilistically complete and almost-surely asymptotically optimal. Third, we develop a novel recursive path section method based on an L1 interpolation over path restrictions, which we use to quickly find feasible path sections. And fourth, we evaluate all novel algorithms against all available OMPL algorithms on benchmarks of eight challenging environments ranging from 21 to 100 degrees of freedom, including multiple robots and nonholonomic constraints. Our findings support the efficiency of our novel algorithms and the benefit of exploiting multilevel abstractions using the terminology of fiber bundles.},

Many of tasks involve decision making removing the need for a human intervener. Robots can efficiently perform their tasks on the ground, air as well as underwater missions. To do so, a very important property required by the robot is to efficiently calculate its path in its surroundings. The path planning problem is a hard problem to solve using deterministic techniques and thus many heuristics based techniques are employed to solve this novel problem. This paper will review some the recent advancements in the path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles using meta-heuristic techniques.

In numerous domains such as robotics, AI, or biology, practitioners develop search heuristics to accelerate their pathfinding algorithms. However, it is a laborious and complex process to handdesign heuristics based on the problem and the structure of a given use case. Here we present PHIL (Path Heuristic with Imitation Learning), a novel neural architecture and a training algorithm for discovering graph search and navigation heuristics from data by leveraging recent advances in imitation learning and graph representation learning. At training time, we aggregate datasets of search trajectories and ground-truth shortest path distances, which we use to train a specialized graph neural network-based heuristic function using backpropagation through steps of the pathfinding process. Our heuristic function learns graph embeddings useful for inferring node distances, runs in constant time independent of graph sizes, and can be easily incorporated in an algorithm such as A* at test time. Experiments show that PHIL reduces the number of explored nodes compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by 40.8\% on average and allows for fast planning in time-critical robotics domains.},

More specifically, the proposed search-planning framework aims to integrate and automate the first two phases (i.e., the assessment phase and the search phase) of a traditional search-and-rescue (SAR) mission. In the first stage, termed assessment-planning we aim to find a high-level assessment plan which the UAV agent can execute in order to visit a set of points of interest. The generated plan of this stage guides the UAV to fly over the objects of interest thus providing a first assessment of the situation at hand. In the second stage, termed search-planning, the UAV trajectory is further fine-tuned to allow the UAV to search in 3D (i.e., across all faces) the objects of interest for survivors. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive simulation analysis.},

In classical approaches to homotopic trajectory planning, trajectory planning and homotopy identification are performed simultaneously, leading to a substantial computational burden. The main benefit of the proposed approach is the development of a method to enumerate and explicitly represent distinct homotopy classes before trajectory planning or optimization, which allow the problem to be decomposed into simpler independent subproblems. The main contribution of the paper is twofold. The first contribution is the description of a method for utilizing existing cell-decomposition methods to enumerate and represent local trajectory generation problems that can be solved efficiently and independently. In addition, a relationship between the proposed cell-sequence representation and homotopy classes is analyzed. The second contribution is a computationally efficient novel formulation of the trajectory optimization problem within a cell sequence via mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP). Computational efficiency and increased solution richness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation studies.

Our approach uses a stochastic trajectory optimization framework to avoid collisions and satisfy smoothness and dynamics constraints. Our algorithm does not require a priori knowledge about global motion or trajectories of dynamic obstacles. Rather, we compute a conservative local bound on the position or trajectory of each obstacle over a short time and use the bound to compute a collision-free trajectory for the robot in an incremental manner. Moreover, we interleave planning and execution of the robot in an adaptive manner to balance between the planning horizon and responsiveness to obstacle. We highlight the performance of our planner in a simulated dynamic environment with the 7-DOF PR2 robot arm and dynamic obstacles.},

Path planning and obstacle avoidance are most researched current topics like navigational challenges for mobile robot. The paper presents application and implementation of Firefly Algorithm (FA) for Mobile Robot Navigation (MRN) in uncertain environment. The uncertainty is defined over the changing environmental condition from static to dynamic. The attraction of one firefly towards the other firefly due to variation of their brightness is the key concept of the proposed study. The proposed controller efficiently explores the environment and improves the global search in less number of iterations and hence it can be easily implemented for real time obstacle avoidance especially for dynamic environment. It solves the challenges of navigation, minimizes the computational calculations, and avoids random moving of fireflies. The performance of proposed controller is better in terms of path optimality when compared to other intelligent navigational approaches.},

The step by step investigations of classical and reactive approaches are made here to understand the development of path planning strategies in various environmental conditions and to identify research gap. The classical approaches such as cell decomposition (CD), roadmap approach (RA), artificial potential field (APF); reactive approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), neural network (NN), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), artificial bee colony (ABC), cuckoo search (CS), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and other miscellaneous algorithms (OMA) are considered for study. The navigation over static and dynamic condition is analyzed (for single and multiple robot systems) and it has been observed that the reactive approaches are more robust and perform well in all terrain when compared to classical approaches. It is also observed that the reactive approaches are used to improve the performance of the classical approaches as a hybrid algorithm. Hence, reactive approaches are more popular and widely used for path planning of mobile robot. The paper concludes with tabular data and charts comparing the frequency of individual navigational strategies which can be used for specific application in robotics.},

  abstract = {Autonomous exploration is an essential task for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in unknown environments. Often, UAVs on these missions must first build a map of the environment via pure exploration and subsequently use (i.e. exploit) the generated map for downstream navigation tasks. Accomplishing these navigation tasks in two separate steps is not always possible and can potentially be disadvantageous for UAVs deployed in outdoor and dynamically changing environments. Current exploration approaches typically use a priori human-generated maps or heuristics such as frontier-based exploration. Other approaches use learning but focus only on learning policies for specific tasks and use sample inefficient random exploration or make impractical assumptions about full map availability. In this paper, we develop an adaptive exploration approach that allows for a trade off between exploration and exploitation in a single step using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We specifically focus on UAVs searching for areas of interest (AoIs) in an unknown environment. The proposed approach uses a map segmentation technique to decompose the environment map into smaller, tractable maps. DDQN and A2C algorithms are extended with a stack of LSTM layers and trained to generate optimal policies for the exploration and exploitation tasks, respectively. Then, an information gain function is repeatedly computed to determine the optimal trade-off between them. We tested our approach in 3 different tasks against 4 baselines. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of navigating through randomly generated environments and covering more AoI in less time compared to the baselines.},

In this work, we are concerned with estimating the pose from laser scans generated by an inexpensive and lightweight LIDAR. We propose a localization system for lightweight (under 200 g) LIDAR sensors with high reliability in arbitrary environments, where other methods fail. The general nature of the proposed method allows deployment in wide array of applications. Moreover, seamless transitioning between different kinds of environments is possible. The advantage of LIDAR localization is that it is robust to poor illumination, which is often challenging for camera-based solutions in dark indoor environments and in the case of the transition between indoor and outdoor environment. Our approach allows executing tasks in poorly-illuminated indoor locations such as historic buildings and warehouses, as well as in the tight outdoor environment, such as forest, where vision-based approaches fail due to large contrast of the scene, and where large well-equipped UAVs cannot be deployed due to the constrained space.},

The nature of the obstacles can be, for example, radar detection areas, cooperating and non-cooperating vehicles, and so on. Thus, it is a complex trajectory planning problem. The proposed planner is based on the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm. Artificial potential fields are combined with the RRT* algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed to a suboptimal solution by biasing the random state generation. The performance of this framework is demonstrated on a complex missile application in a heterogeneous environment. Indeed, since the air density decreases exponentially with altitude, the maneuverability of the aerial vehicle depending on aerodynamic forces also decreases exponentially with altitude. To face this problem, the shortest paths of Dubins-like vehicles traveling in a heterogeneous environment are used to build the metric. In the simulation results, this framework can find the first solution with fewer iterations than the RRT and the RRT* algorithm. Moreover, the final solution obtained within a given number of iterations is closer to an optimal solution regarding the considered criterion.},

AlphaZero contributes powerful neural network guided search algorithms, which we augment with recursion. AlphaNPI only assumes a hierarchical program specification with sparse rewards: 1 when the program execution satisfies the specification, and 0 otherwise. This specification enables us to overcome the need for strong supervision in the form of execution traces and consequently train NPI models effectively with reinforcement learning. The experiments show that AlphaNPI can sort as well as previous strongly supervised NPI variants. The AlphaNPI agent is also trained on a Tower of Hanoi puzzle with two disks and is shown to generalize to puzzles with an arbitrary number of disks. The experiments also show that when deploying our neural network policies, it is advantageous to do planning with guided Monte Carlo tree search.},

We pursue a graph search method that, despite the high dimensionality of the problem, the complex dynamics of the system and the continuously changing environment model is capable of generating dynamically feasible motions in real-time. This is enabled by leveraging the differential flatness property of the system and by developing a structured search space based on state lattice motion primitives. We suggest a greedy algorithm to generate these primitives off-line automatically, given the robot's motion model. The process samples the reachability of the system and reduces it to a set of representative, canonical motions that are compatible with the state lattice structure, which guarantees that any incremental replanning algorithm is able to produce smooth dynamically feasible motion plans while reusing previous computation between replans. Simulated and physical experimental results demonstrate real-time replanning due to the inevitable and frequent world model updates during micro-UAV motion in partially known environments.},

Current approaches have however either assumed the knowledge of differential one-forms related to a skeletonization of the collision space, or have relied on a simplicial representation of the free space. Both of these approaches are currently however not yet practical for higher dimensional configuration spaces. We propose 2D topological task projections (TTPs): mappings from the configuration space to 2-dimensional spaces where simplicial complex filtrations and persistent homology can identify topological properties of the high-dimensional free configuration space. Our approach only requires the availability of collision free samples to identify winding centers that can be used to determine homotopy inequivalent trajectories. We propose the Winding Augmented RRT and RRT* (WA-RRT/RRT*) algorithms using which homotopy inequivalent trajectories can be found. We evaluate our approach in experiments with configuration spaces of planar linkages with 2-10 degrees of freedom. Results indicate that our approach can reliably identify suitable topological task projections and our proposed WA-RRT and WA-RRT* algorithms were able to identify a collection of homotopy inequivalent trajectories in each considered configuration space dimension.},

Our approach is applicable to general configuration spaces and relies only on the availability of collision free samples. Unlike previous sampling-based approaches in robotics which use graphs to capture information about the path-connectedness of a configuration space, we construct a multiscale approximation of neighborhoods of the collision free configurations based on filtrations of simplicial complexes. Our approach thereby extracts additional homological information which is essential for a topological trajectory classification. We propose a multiscale classification algorithm for trajectories in configuration spaces of arbitrary dimension and for sets of trajectories starting and ending in two fixed points. Using a cone construction, we then generalize this approach to classify sets of trajectories even when trajectory start and end points are allowed to vary in path-connected subsets. We furthermore show how an augmented filtration of simplicial complexes based on an arbitrary function on the configuration space, such as a costmap, can be defined to incorporate additional constraints. We present an evaluation of our approach in 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-dimensional configuration spaces in simulation and in real-world experiments using a Baxter robot and motion capture data.},

One challenge is that demonstrated trajectories may vary dramatically: it can be very difficult, if not impossible, for a system to learn control policies unless the trajectories are clustered into meaningful consistent subsets. Metric clustering methods, based on a distance measure, require quadratic time to compute a pairwise distance matrix and do not naturally distinguish topologically distinct trajectories. This paper presents an algorithm for topological clustering based on relative persistent homology, which, for a fixed underlying simplicial representation and discretization of trajectories, requires only linear time in the number of trajectories. The algorithm incorporates global constraints formalized in terms of the topology of sublevel or superlevel sets of a function and can be extended to incorporate probabilistic motion models. In experiments with real automobile and ship GPS trajectories as well as pedestrian trajectories extracted from video, the algorithm clusters trajectories into meaningful consistent subsets and, as we show in an experiment with ship trajectories, results in a faster and more efficient clustering than a metric clustering by Fr\'echet distance.},

The FFA-Net architecture consists of three key components: 1) A novel Feature Attention (FA) module combines Channel Attention with Pixel Attention mechanism, considering that different channel-wise features contain totally different weighted information and haze distribution is uneven on the different image pixels. FA treats different features and pixels unequally, which provides additional flexibility in dealing with different types of information, expanding the representational ability of CNNs. 2) A basic block structure consists of Local Residual Learning and Feature Attention, Local Residual Learning allowing the less important information such as thin haze region or low-frequency to be bypassed through multiple local residual connections, let main network architecture focus on more effective information. 3) An Attention-based different levels Feature Fusion (FFA) structure, the feature weights are adaptively learned from the Feature Attention (FA) module, giving more weight to important features. This structure can also retain the information of shallow layers and pass it into deep layers. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FFA-Net surpasses previous state-of-the-art single image dehazing methods by a very large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, boosting the best published PSNR metric from 30.23db to 36.39db on the SOTS indoor test dataset.

  abstract = {In this paper, we reduce the image dehazing problem to an image-to-image translation problem, and propose Enhanced Pix2pix Dehazing Network (EPDN), which generates a haze-free image without relying on the physical scattering model. EPDN is embedded by a generative adversarial network, which is followed by a well-designed enhancer. Inspired by visual perception global-first [5] theory, the discriminator guides the generator to create a pseudo realistic image on a coarse scale, while the enhancer following the generator is required to produce a realistic dehazing image on the fine scale. The enhancer contains two enhancing blocks based on the receptive field model, which reinforces the dehazing effect in both color and details. The embedded GAN is jointly trained with the enhancer. Extensive experiment results on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets show that the proposed EPDN is superior to the state-ofthe-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, PI, and subjective visual effect.},

The algorithm was integrated with a simplified TCAS system, showing the capability of the autonomous path planner to follow protocols originally used in manned aircraft. The solution is based on a modified RRT algorithm and a trajectory optimization algorithm. Multiple basic simulations were performed to evaluate the real-time capabilities of the algorithms.

However, the majority of deep learning based LLIE algorithms leverage relighting by enhancing the illumination components that directly determines the image brightness, regretfully, they ignore the information of reflectance components, which may cause problems such as image noise and color distortion in reconstructed images. To tackle this problem, in this letter, we propose a component enhancement network based on Generative Adversarial Network (Component-GAN) for recovering clear images from low-light ones. Specifically, the network is composed of the decomposition part for dividing the paired low/normal-light images into illumination components and reflectance components, and the enhancement part for generating high-quality images. It is worth to note that we provide two branches of component enhancement network, which are parallel to improve the two components simultaneously. Hereby, we treat the reconstruction part as the generative network and adopt discriminative network to boost image reconstruction performance. Through extensive experiments, the proposed approach outperforms some state-of-the-art LLIE methods in terms of visual and subjective qualities.},

In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate ``narrow passages'' can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.},

Such paths are not fit for mobile robot as it has to slow down at these sharp turns. These robots could be carrying delicate, dangerous, or precious items and executing these sharp turns may not be feasible kinematically. On the contrary, smooth trajectories are often desired for robot motion and must be generated while considering the static and dynamic obstacles and other constraints like feasible curvature, robot and lane dimensions, and speed. The aim of this paper is to succinctly summarize and review the path smoothing techniques in robot navigation and discuss the challenges and future trends. Both autonomous mobile robots and autonomous vehicles (outdoor robots or self-driving cars) are discussed. The state-of-the-art algorithms are broadly classified into different categories and each approach is introduced briefly with necessary background, merits, and drawbacks.

However, both linearity of the underlying SS model and accurate knowledge of it are often not encountered in practice. Here, we present KalmanNet, a real-time state estimator that learns from data to carry out Kalman filtering under non-linear dynamics with partial information. By incorporating the structural SS model with a dedicated recurrent neural network module in the flow of the KF, we retain data efficiency and interpretability of the classic algorithm while implicitly learning complex dynamics from data. We demonstrate numerically that KalmanNet overcomes non-linearities and model mismatch, outperforming classic filtering methods operating with both mismatched and accurate domain knowledge.},

However, controlling UAVs remotely in complex environments limits the capability of the UAVs and decreases the efficiency of the whole system. Therefore, many researchers are working on autonomous UAV navigation where UAVs can move and perform the assigned tasks based on their surroundings. With recent technological advancements, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has proliferated. Autonomous UAV navigation is an example of an application in which AI plays a critical role in providing fundamental human control characteristics. Thus, many researchers have adopted different AI approaches to make autonomous UAV navigation more efficient. This paper comprehensively surveys and categorizes several AI approaches for autonomous UAV navigation implicated by several researchers. Different AI approaches comprise mathematical-based optimization and model-based learning approaches. The fundamentals, working principles, and main features of the different optimization-based and learning-based approaches are discussed in this paper. In addition, the characteristics, types, navigation models, and applications of UAVs are highlighted to make AI implementation understandable.

We extend the existing work on polynomial trajectory generation by presenting a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path segments in an unconstrained quadratic program that is numerically stable for highorder polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for efficient sparse computation. We also present a technique for automatically selecting the amount of time allocated to each segment, and hence the quadrotor speeds along the path, as a function of a single parameter determining aggressiveness, subject to actuator constraints. The use of polynomial trajectories, coupled with the differentially flat representation of the quadrotor, eliminates the need for computationally intensive sampling and simulation in the high dimensional state space of the vehicle during motion planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based optimal kinodynamic planning methods, but sacrifices the guarantee of asymptotic convergence to the global optimum that those methods provide. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by efficiently generating trajectories through challenging indoor spaces and successfully traversing them at speeds up to 8 m/s.

An essential aspect of UAV autonomy is the ability for automatic path planning. In this paper, we use the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to cope with the complexity of the problem and compute feasible and quasi-optimal trajectories for fixed wing UAVs in a complex 3D environment, while considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle. The characteristics of the optimal path are represented in the form of a multiobjective cost function that we developed. The paths produced are composed of line segments, circular arcs and vertical helices. We reduce the execution time of our solutions by using the ``single-program, multiple-data'' parallel programming paradigm and we achieve real-time performance on standard commercial off-the-shelf multicore CPUs. After achieving a quasi-linear speedup of 7.3 on 8 cores and an execution time of 10 s for both algorithms, we conclude that by using a parallel implementation on standard multicore CPUs, real-time path planning for UAVs is possible. Moreover, our rigorous comparison of the two algorithms shows, with statistical significance, that the GA produces superior trajectories to the PSO.},

In this paper, the path planning consists of a global planner, that finds the optimal path, and in a local planner, recalculates the path to avoid obstacles. The main focus is to improve the performance of local planning techniques decreasing the complexity. There are two main ways to do it: bidirectional algorithms, improving time, and global planners, improving time and completeness. Thus, we propose a global planner algorithm that generates auxiliary nodes, backtracking by the goal node. We perform a comparison among A*, Bi A*, Artificial Potential Field (APF), Bi APF, Rapid Exploring Random Tree (RRT), and Bi RRT with and without the global planner through statistical metrics of time, path length, CPU, and memory. The results show the advantages of using bidirectional algorithms and the proposed global planner. The bidirectional algorithms decrease the time to return to the trajectory and sometimes assist in the algorithm's completeness. The proposed global planner reduced the planning time by 91.6\% and improved the completeness of all algorithms in an unstructured indoor environment.},

  abstract = {Camera systems of automated vehicles capture images from the surrounding environment and process these datastreams with algorithms to detect and classify objects. A lot of research has been devoted to improve object detection algorithms in order to provide highly accurate detection results in real time. However, these algorithms show a strong drop in performance as soon as they are exposed to adverse weather. Poor weather conditions such as rain, fog or snow lead to a reduction in visibility and thus objects are more difficult to recognize or not visible at all. This leads to a high degree of uncertainty for an automotive camera system. To enable automated driving, camera systems must be able to cope with adverse weather and the associated high uncertainty. Including more weather image data when training the algorithms can improve object detection in bad visibility conditions. However, weather image data is difficult to collect in reality and thus only available to a limited extent. In this work, we evaluate the possibility of using Generative Adversarial Networks to create synthetic weather image data. For this purpose, we compare the generated images of different network architectures trained on a diverse weather dataset collected from Flickr. The resulting data is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to its realism and suggests that our approach is capable of generating realistic weather images.},

The proposed framework exploits the Voronoi bias property of Rapidly exploring Random Tree* (RRT*), which balances the exploration-exploitation in Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is employed to learn policy (sequence of actions), while RRT* is planning simultaneously. Once policy is learned for a fixed start and goal, repeated planing for identical start and goal can be avoided. In case of any environmental uncertainties, RL dynamically adapts the learned policy with the help of RRT*. Apparently, both learning and planning complement each other to handle environmental uncertainties dynamically in real-time and online. Interestingly, more the proposed algorithm runs, its efficiency increases in terms of planning time and uncertainty handling capability over the contender algorithm (i.e., RRT*). Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Providing mobile robots with autonomous capabilities is advantageous. It allows one to dispense with the intervention of human operators, which may prove beneficial in economic and safety terms. Autonomy requires, in most cases, the use of path planners that enable the robot to deliberate about how to move from its location at one moment to another. Looking for the most appropriate path planning algorithm according to the requirements imposed by users can be challenging, given the overwhelming number of approaches that exist in the literature. Moreover, the past review works analyzed here cover only some of these approaches, missing important ones. For this reason, our paper aims to serve as a starting point for a clear and comprehensive overview of the research to date. It introduces a global classification of path planning algorithms, with a focus on those approaches used along with autonomous ground vehicles, but is also extendable to other robots moving on surfaces, such as autonomous boats. Moreover, the models used to represent the environment, together with the robot mobility and dynamics, are also addressed from the perspective of path planning. Each of the path planning categories presented in the classification is disclosed and analyzed, and a discussion about their applicability is added at the end.},

The algorithm relies on a mixed-use of decentralized Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the A* pathfinder. Each UAV has elementary cognitive skills to sense information about the nearby environment which are then fed as an input to the network. The neural network creates a correlation between the current state of a UAV and the best action to take at each time step. The exploration strategy is stored in a labeled database for the single-UAV case; the neural network learns and replicates it in the multi-UAV case, being able to generalize the acquired skills over new maps not contained in the database. The training session imitates human priors in a multi-class classification, which completely bypasses common drawbacks such as the need for large databases or high computational resources. The case study focuses on complex urban areas, for which the grid resolution of the traditional approaches can't model the problem with sufficient accuracy.},

Standard probabilistic roadmap methods (PRM) have been successfully used to answer such feasibility problems. These methods provide, at the most a single solution but do not provide a complete overview of the possible motions which have to be evaluated in a complete engineering task. We focus here on the open question of building probabilistic roadmaps which can provide an exhaustive list of all the solutions which can not be distorted from one to another while staying collision free. We call such roadmaps homotopy preserving probabilistic roadmap (HPPR). We propose a new algorithm for creating HPPR.},

Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software components with real-world flights.},

After planning a path to the closest point in the frontier between free and unknown space, the robot computes an estimate of the future length of its tether and decides, by comparing the anticipated length with the minimum possible tether length, whether the path should be followed or not. If the anticipated tether is longer than the minimum tether by a function of the expected radius of the obstacles, a path planner with homotopic constraints is used to plan a path that brings the robot tether to the same homotopy class of the shortest tether. This behavior will not only limit the tether length but also will prevent tether entangling on the obstacles of the environment. We evaluate our method in different simulated environments and illustrate the approach with an actual tethered robot.},

A point cloud generated from a 3D mapping service is used to represent complex inspection targets and provided as the input of the path planning method. The method is designed as a sampling-based sequential optimization to calculate and optimize an inspection path while considering the limitation of the sensors, inspection efficiency, and safety requirements of the drones. The proposed method is evaluated for both the use case of bridge inspection and power pylon inspection. A comparison between the proposed path search algorithm and TSP solver is made. Furthermore, the scalability of the method is assessed with different sizes of the inspection problem.},

First, the RRT algorithm is used to generate the initial path, then the minimum snap algorithm is used to smooth the initial path and obtain a trajectory suitable for the actual flight of the UAV. However, because the UAV is considered as a particle in the simulation, during the actual flight, this trajectory may not guarantee the safe flight of the UAV and may cause the UAV to collide with an obstacle or other nearby UAVs in the cases of formation flight. To solve this problem, flight corridor concept is used to limit the UAV's flight trajectory for ensuring the safe flight of the UAV. Simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively ensure the safety, smoothness, feasibility, and trajectory of unmanned aerial vehicles.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is playing an increasingly important role in our lives. It has already made a huge impact in areas, such as cancer diagnosis, precision medicine, self-driving cars, predictive forecasting, and speech recognition. The painstakingly handcrafted feature extractors used in traditional learning, classification, and pattern recognition systems are not scalable for large-sized data sets. In many cases, depending on the problem complexity, DL can also overcome the limitations of earlier shallow networks that prevented efficient training and abstractions of hierarchical representations of multi-dimensional training data. Deep neural network (DNN) uses multiple (deep) layers of units with highly optimized algorithms and architectures. This paper reviews several optimization methods to improve the accuracy of the training and to reduce training time. We delve into the math behind training algorithms used in recent deep networks. We describe current shortcomings, enhancements, and implementations. The review also covers different types of deep architectures, such as deep convolution networks, deep residual networks, recurrent neural networks, reinforcement learning, variational autoencoders, and others.},

Currently, these inspections are primarily conducted by maintenance personnel. Inspectors must scrutinize the aircraft's surface to find and document defects such as dents, hail damage, broken fasteners, etc.; this is a time consuming, tedious, and hazardous process. The goal of this work is to develop a visual inspection system which can be used by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and to test the feasibility of this system on military aircraft. Using an autonomous system in place of trained personnel will improve the safety and efficiency of the inspection process. Open-source software for coverage path planning (CPP) is modified and used to create a path from which the UAV can view the entire top surface of the aircraft. Simulated and experimental flight testing is conducted to validate the generated paths by collecting imagery, flight data, and coverage estimates. Simulation is also used to predict UAV performance for an inspection of a full-size aircraft. Analysis shows that multirotor UAVs are a viable inspection platform for military aircraft.},

In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor simulator: Flightmare. Flightmare is composed of two main components: a configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics engine for dynamics simulation. Those two components are totally decoupled and can run independently of each other. This makes our simulator extremely fast: rendering achieves speeds of up to 230 Hz, while physics simulation of up to 200,000 Hz on a laptop. In addition, Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) integration with a virtual-reality headset for interaction with the simulated environment. We demonstrate the flexibility of Flightmare by using it for two different robotic tasks: quadrotor control using deep reinforcement learning and collision-free path planning in a complex 3D environment.},

  abstract = {State estimation is the most critical capability for MAV (Micro-Aerial Vehicle) localization, autonomous obstacle avoidance, robust flight control and 3D environmental mapping. There are three main challenges for MAV state estimation: (1) it can deal with aggressive 6 DOF (Degree Of Freedom) motion; (2) it should be robust to intermittent GPS (Global Positioning System) (even GPS-denied) situations; (3) it should work well both for low- and high-altitude flight. In this paper, we present a state estimation technique by fusing long-range stereo visual odometry, GPS, barometric and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurements. The new estimation system has two main parts, a stochastic cloning EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) estimator that loosely fuses both absolute state measurements (GPS, barometer) and the relative state measurements (IMU, visual odometry), and is derived and discussed in detail. A long-range stereo visual odometry is proposed for high-altitude MAV odometry calculation by using both multi-view stereo triangulation and a multi-view stereo inverse depth filter. The odometry takes the EKF information (IMU integral) for robust camera pose tracking and image feature matching, and the stereo odometry output serves as the relative measurements for the update of the state estimation. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset and our real flight dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation system, especially for the aggressive, intermittent GPS and high-altitude MAV flight.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to consider the smooth path planning problem for a mobile robot based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and the Bezier curve. Design/methodology/approach The workspace of a mobile robot is described by a new grid-based representation that facilitates the operations of the adopted GA. The chromosome of the GA is composed of a sequence of binary numbered grids (i.e. control points of the Bezier curve). Ordinary genetic operators including crossover and mutation are used to search the optimum chromosome where the optimization criterion is the length of a piecewise collision-free Bezier curve path determined by the control points. Findings This paper has proposed a new smooth path planning for a mobile robot by resorting to the GA and the Bezier curve. A new grid-based representation of the workspace has been presented, which makes it convenient to perform operations in the GA. The GA has been used to search the optimum control points that determine the Bezier curve-based smooth path. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified by a numerical experiment, and some performances of the obtained method have also been analyzed. Research limitations/implications There still remain many interesting topics, for example, how to solve the specific smooth path planning problem by using the GA and how to promote the computational efficiency in the more grids case. These issues deserve further research. Originality/value The purpose of this paper is to improve the existing results by making the following three distinctive contributions: a rigorous mathematical formulation of the path planning optimization problem is formulated; a general grid-based representation (2n \texttimes{} 2n) is proposed to describe the workspace of the mobile robots to facilitate the implementation of the GA where n is chosen according to the trade-off between the accuracy and the computational burden; and the control points of the Bezier curve are directly linked to the optimization criteria so that the generated paths are guaranteed to be optimal without any need for smoothing afterwards.},

  abstract = {The task of planning trajectories for a mobile robot hat received considerable attention in the research literature. Algorithms exist for handling a variety of robot shapes, configurations, motion constraints, and environments. Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of unknown or partially-known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan (indoor) or terrain map (outdoor). Existing approaches plan an initial global path or route based on known information and then modify the plan locally as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors.While this strategy works well in environments with small, sparse obstacles, it can lead to grossly suboptimal and incomplete results in cluttered spaces. An alternative approach is to replan the global path from scratch each time a new obstacle is discovered. While this approach is optimal, it is grossly inefficient and can require a high-performance computer for real-time operation. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner. D* models the environment as a graph, where each node represents a robot state (e.g., a location in a room), and each arc represents the cost (e.g., distance to travel) of moving between two states. Initially, a path is planned from the goal to the robot's location using known information. As the robot moves, its sensors discover obstacles in its path. These discoveries are handled by modifying the arc costs. D* propagates information minimally about these arc changes in the graph ...},

  abstract = {Agents often have to solve series of similar search problems. Adaptive A * is a recent incremental heuristic search algorithm that solves series of similar search problems faster than A * because it updates the h-values using information from previous searches. It basically transforms consistent h-values into more informed consistent h-values. This allows it to find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase over time since consistent h-values remain consistent after action cost increases. However, it is not guaranteed to find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can decrease over time because consistent h-values do not necessarily remain consistent after action cost decreases. Thus, the h-values need to get corrected after action cost decreases. In this paper, we show how to do that, resulting in Generalized Adaptive A* (GAA*) that finds shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase or decrease over time. Our experiments demonstrate that Generalized Adaptive A* outperforms breadth-first search, A* and D* Lite for moving-target search, where D * Lite is an alternative state-of-the-art incremental heuristic search algorithm that finds shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase or decrease over time.},

However, we still encounter challenges in terms of improving the computational efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithms for applications in autonomous flight with micro aerial vehicles in which it is difficult to use high quality sensors and pow- erful processors because of constraints on size and weight. In this paper, we present a filter-based stereo visual inertial odometry that uses the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) [1]. Previous work on stereo visual inertial odometry has resulted in solutions that are computationally expensive. We demonstrate that our Stereo Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (S-MSCKF) is comparable to state-of-art monocular solutions in terms of computational cost, while providing signifi- cantly greater robustness. We evaluate our S-MSCKF algorithm and compare it with state-of-art methods including OKVIS, ROVIO, and VINS-MONO on both the EuRoC dataset, and our own experimental datasets demonstrating fast autonomous flight with maximum speed of 17.5m/s in indoor and outdoor environments.

For this purpose, we discuss the use of persistent cohomology with coefficients in a finite field to compute a basis which allows us to efficiently solve the path planning problem. The proposed approach can be used both in the case where a part of a configuration space is wellapproximated by samples and, more generally, with arbitrary filtrations arising from real-world data sets. Furthermore, our approach can generate motions in a subset of the configuration space specified by the sub- or superlevel set of a filtration function such as a cost function or probability distribution. Our experiments show that our approach is highly scalable in low dimensions and we present results on simulated PR2 arm motions as well as GPS trace and motion capture data.},

While recent work has approached the problem of topological motion planning under the assumption that the configuration space and obstacles within it are explicitly described in a noise-free manner, we focus on trajectory classification and present a samplingbased approach which can handle noise, which is applicable to general configuration spaces and which relies only on the availability of collision free samples. Unlike previous samplingbased approaches in robotics which use graphs to capture information about the path-connectedness of a configuration space, we construct a multiscale approximation of neighborhoods of the collision free configurations based on filtrations of simplicial complexes. Our approach thereby extracts additional homological information which is essential for a topological trajectory classification. By computing a basis for the first persistent homology groups, we obtain a multiscale classification algorithm for trajectories in configuration spaces of arbitrary dimension. We furthermore show how an augmented filtration of simplicial complexes based on a cost function can be defined to incorporate additional constraints. We present an evaluation of our approach in 2, 3, 4 and 6 dimensional configuration spaces in simulation and using a Baxter robot.},

The main goal of these algorithms is to find the shortest and smooth path between the starting and target points. This paper makes use of a B\'ezier curve-based model for path planning. The control points of the B\'ezier curve significantly influence the length and smoothness of the path. In this paper, a novel Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) algorithm has been proposed to optimize the control points of B\'ezier curve, and the proposed algorithm comes in two variants: CPSO-I and CPSO-II. Using the chosen control points, the optimum smooth path that minimizes the total distance between the starting and ending points is selected. To evaluate the CPSO algorithm, the results of the CPSO-I and CPSO-II algorithms are compared with the standard PSO algorithm. The experimental results proved that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding the optimal path. Moreover, the CPSO algorithm was tested against different numbers of control points and obstacles, and the CPSO algorithm achieved competitive results.},

The requirement of computational tractability typically leads to optimization problems that do not include the obstacle constraints (collision checks are done on the solutions) or use a convex decomposition of the free space and then impose an ad-hoc time allocation scheme for each interval of the trajectory. Moreover, safety guarantees are usually obtained by having a local planner that plans a trajectory with a final ``stop'' condition in the freeknown space. However, these two decisions typically lead to slow and conservative trajectories. We propose FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to overcome these issues. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety guarantees are ensured by always having a feasible, safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space at the start of each replanning step. Furthermore, we present a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program formulation in which the solver can choose the trajectory interval allocation, and where a time allocation heuristic is computed efficiently using the result of the previous replanning iteration. This proposed algorithm is tested extensively both in simulation and in real hardware, showing agile flights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 3.6 m/s.},

PANTHER plans trajectories that avoid dynamic obstacles while also keeping them in the sensor field of view (FOV) and minimizing the blur to aid in object tracking. The rotation and translation of the UAV are jointly optimized, which allows PANTHER to fully exploit the differential flatness of multirotors to maximize the PA objective. Real-time performance is achieved by implicitly imposing the underactuated dynamics of the UAV through the Hopf fibration. PANTHER is able to keep the obstacles inside the FOV 7.9 and 1.5 times more than non-PA approaches and PA approaches that decouple translation and yaw, respectively. The projected velocity (and hence the blur) is reduced by 18\% and 34\%, respectively. This leads to average success rates three times larger than state-of-the-art approaches in multi-obstacle avoidance scenarios. The MINVO basis is used to impose low-conservative collision avoidance constraints in position and velocity space. Finally, extensive hardware experiments in unknown dynamic environments with all the computation running onboard are presented, with velocities of up to 5.8 m/s, and with relative velocities (with respect to the obstacles) of up to 6.3 m/s. The only sensors used are an IMU, a forward-facing depth camera, and a downward-facing monocular camera.},

UAVs with this capability have begun to emerge in the literature with advances in lightweight sensing and computing. Although the planning methodologies vary from platform to platform, many algorithms adopt a hierarchical planning architecture where a slow, low-fidelity global planner guides a fast, high-fidelity local planner. However, in unknown environments, this approach can lead to erratic or unstable behavior due to the interaction between the global planner, whose solution is changing constantly, and the local planner; a consequence of not capturing higher-order dynamics in the global plan. This work proposes a planning framework in which multi-fidelity models are used to reduce the discrepancy between the local and global planner. Our approach uses high-, medium-, and low-fidelity models to compose a path that captures higher-order dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. In addition, we address the interaction between a fast planner and a slower mapper by considering the sensor data not yet fused into the map during the collision check. This novel mapping and planning framework for agile flights is validated in simulation and hardware experiments, showing replanning times of 5-40 ms in cluttered environments.},

To effectively monitor and collect data about a wildfire, UAS path planning is essential. Many of the applications adopt a centralized approach that uses a computer on the ground to provide path planning information for individual UASs. The applicability and robustness of such centralized approaches are limited due to the challenging wildfire environments. In addition, very few of the existing applications focus on the most actively spreading region of the fire which needs special monitoring attention. In this paper, we present an on-board path planning algorithm for UAS-based wildfire monitoring. The proposed algorithm uses real-time data collected by the UAS to direct the UAS to monitor the wildfire with special attention to the most active regions of the fire. Simulation results have been presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm in different simulated wildfire scenarios.},

  abstract = {Removing adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow from images is an important problem in many applications. Most methods proposed in the literature have been designed to deal with just removing one type of degradation. Recently, a CNN-based method using neural architecture search (All-in-One) was proposed to remove all the weather conditions at once. However, it has a large number of parameters as it uses multiple encoders to cater to each weather removal task and still has scope for improvement in its performance. In this work, we focus on developing an efficient solution for the all adverse weather removal problem. To this end, we propose TransWeather, a transformer-based end-to-end model with just a single encoder and a decoder that can restore an image degraded by any weather condition. Specifically, we utilize a novel transformer encoder using intra-patch transformer blocks to enhance attention inside the patches to effectively remove smaller weather degradations. We also introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather type embeddings to adjust to the weather degradation at hand. TransWeather achieves significant improvements across multiple test datasets over both All-in-One network as well as methods fine-tuned for specific tasks. In particular, TransWeather pushes the current state-of-the-art by +6.34 PSNR on the Test1 (rain+fog) dataset, +4.93 PSNR on the SnowTest100K-L dataset and +3.11 PSNR on the RainDrop test dataset. TransWeather is also validated on real world test images and found to be more effective than previous methods.

Although recent advances allow robots to evolve in many such environments, one of the most important problems remains the establishment of collision-free trajectories in static or partially (temporal) static environments. This paper presents a different approach to address this problem, proposing a methodology based on homotopy continuation methods (HCM) capable of generating collision-free trajectories in two and three dimensions. The basic idea behind the proposal relies on the construction of a nonlinear equation representing the map of the environment, making it possible to apply HCM methods to obtain collision-free paths.

  abstract = {Path planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is a challenging problem due to the added time dimension in search space. In approaches that ignore the time dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is unavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally sub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness, it is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of adaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion planning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the context of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the idea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic environments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model. Specifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions of the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a low-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete and is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost sub-optimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of 3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show that the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over 4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates significantly from the one suggested by the heuristic.},

Our algorithm employs the heuristic that nearby configurations are likely to be invalidated by the same change. To find diverse short paths, the algorithm finds the shortest detour avoiding a collection of balls imposed on the graph as simulated obstacles. Different collections yield different short paths. Paths may then be checked for validity as a cheap alternative to checking or reconstructing the entire roadmap. We describe a formal definition of path set diversity and several measures on which to evaluate our algorithm. We compare the speed and quality of our heuristic algorithm's results against an exact algorithm that computes the optimally shortest set of paths on the roadmap having a minimum diversity.

  abstract = {Planning a practical three-dimensional (3-D) flight path for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a key challenge for the follow-up management and decision making in disaster emergency response. The ideal flight path is expected to balance the total flight path length and the terrain threat, to shorten the flight time and reduce the possibility of collision. However, in the traditional methods, the tradeoff between these concerns is difficult to achieve, and practical constraints are lacking in the optimized objective functions, which leads to inaccurate modeling. In addition, the traditional methods based on gradient optimization lack an accurate optimization capability in the complex multimodal objective space, resulting in a nonoptimal path. Thus, in this article, an accurate UAV 3-D path planning approach in accordance with an enhanced multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed (APPMS). In the APPMS method, the path planning mission is converted into a multiobjective optimization task with multiple constraints, and the objectives based on the total flight path length and degree of terrain threat are simultaneously optimized. In addition, to obtain the optimal UAV 3-D flight path, an accurate swarm intelligence search approach based on improved ant colony optimization is introduced, which can improve the global and local search capabilities by using the preferred search direction and random neighborhood search mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed APPMS method was demonstrated in three groups of simulated experiments with different degrees of terrain threat, and a real-data experiment with 3-D terrain data from an actual emergency situation.},

The B-RRT* algorithm introduces the bidirectional search to obtain faster convergence and shorter paths. To solve the problems of path planning in complex environments with concavities, convexities, narrow channels, mazes and multiple obstacles, an adaptive extension bidirectional RRT* (AEB-RRT*) algorithm is proposed. The AEB-RRT* algorithm simultaneously extends from both the starting point and the ending point, and adaptively adjusts the sampling probability and different expansion methods according to the number of collision detection failures. After acquiring a feasible path, it is then post-processed by interpolation and the principle of triangular inequality to obtain a shorter collision-free path. And the Manhattan distance replaces the Euclidean distance to calculate the distances between nodes in order to achieve higher computational efficiency. The experimental results show that the AEB-RRT* algorithm outperforms other path planning algorithms in stronger search ability, obtaining near-optimal or best paths with high efficiency and better robustness. Furthermore, it is successfully applied to solve the 6-DOF arc welding robot path planning problem.},

The key insight that allows us to solve this problem is to stochastically distribute the robots across different routes in the environment by assigning them paths in different topologically distinct classes, so as to lower congestion and the overall travel time for all robots in the environment. We outline the computation of topologically distinct paths in a spatio-temporal configuration space and propose methods for the stochastic assignment of paths to the robots.

In this article, we address the problem of autonomous UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments by formulating it as a Markov decision process with sparse rewards and propose an algorithm named deep reinforcement learning (RL) with nonexpert helpers (LwH). In contrast to prior RL-based methods that put huge efforts into reward shaping, we adopt the sparse reward scheme, i.e., a UAV will be rewarded if and only if it completes navigation tasks. Using the sparse reward scheme ensures that the solution is not biased toward potentially suboptimal directions. However, having no intermediate rewards hinders the agent from efficient learning since informative states are rarely encountered. To handle the challenge, we assume that a prior policy (nonexpert helper) that might be of poor performance is available to the learning agent. The prior policy plays the role of guiding the agent in exploring the state space by reshaping the behavior policy used for environmental interaction. It also assists the agent in achieving goals by setting dynamic learning objectives with increasing difficulty. To evaluate our proposed method, we construct a simulator for UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments and compare our algorithm with several baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that LwH significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms handling sparse rewards and yields impressive navigation policies comparable to those learned in the environment with dense rewards.},

In the global planner, a time-based RRT algorithm is used to generate a feasible heuristic trajectory for a specific task in the dynamic environment. However, this heuristic trajectory is nonoptimal. In the dynamic replanner, the time-based nodes on the heuristic trajectory are updated due to the internal contraction force and the repulsive force from the obstacles. In this way, the heuristic trajectory is optimized continuously, and the final trajectory can be proved to be optimal in the homotopy class of the heuristic trajectory. Simulation experiments reveal that compared with two stateof-the-art algorithms, our proposed method can achieve better performance in dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {Visibility restoration of an image degraded by scattering media (such as haze, fog, smog) is a challenging task which requires careful design of computational methods. The fundamental problem which limits clear image reconstruction is the random diffusion of light in the scattering medium. Recently, the dark channel prior method has emerged as a powerful approach for haze removal under adverse weather conditions. However, this method requires high computational time, and fails to achieve haze-free image in the sky region. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel imaging method based on quadtree theory combined with transmission optimization (QTCTO) to restore the visibility of images degraded by scattering medium. The proposed method uses the quadtree theory (for region segmentation) to estimate the global atmospheric light, while the transmission in the media is estimated by coefficient modification for the dark channel. The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against scattering (under smoke and turbid water conditions) and has the advantage of low computational time. The proposed method can be used for security surveillance, remote sensing, and various military applications.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present an optimization-based framework for multicopter trajectory planning subject to geometrical configuration constraints and user-defined dynamic constraints. The basis of the framework is a novel trajectory representation built upon our novel optimality conditions for unconstrained control effort minimization. We design linear-complexity operations on this representation to conduct spatial\textendash temporal deformation under various planning requirements. Smooth maps are utilized to exactly eliminate geometrical constraints in a lightweight fashion. A variety of state-input constraints are supported by the decoupling of dense constraint evaluation from sparse parameterization and the backward differentiation of flatness map. As a result, this framework transforms a generally constrained multicopter planning problem into an unconstrained optimization that can be solved reliably and efficiently. Our framework bridges the gaps among solution quality, planning efficiency, and constraint fidelity for a multicopter with limited resources and maneuvering capability. Its generality and robustness are both demonstrated by applications to different flight tasks. Extensive simulations and benchmarks are also conducted to show its capability of generating high-quality solutions while retaining the computation speed against other specialized methods by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Rapidly random-exploring tree (RRT) and its variants are very popular due to their ability to quickly and efficiently explore the state space. However, they suffer sensitivity to the initial solution and slow convergence to the optimal solution, which means that they consume a lot of memory and time to find the optimal path. It is critical to quickly find a short path in many applications such as the autonomous vehicle with limited power/fuel. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel optimal path planning algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), namely the neural RRT* (NRRT*). The NRRT* utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution generated from a CNN model. The model is trained using quantities of successful path planning cases. In this article, we use the A* algorithm to generate the training data set consisting of the map information and the optimal path. For a given task, the proposed CNN model can predict the probability distribution of the optimal path on the map, which is used to guide the sampling process. The time cost and memory usage of the planned path are selected as the metric to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the NRRT*. The simulation results reveal that the NRRT* can achieve convincing performance compared with the state-of-the-art path planning algorithms. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this article stems from the need to develop a fast and efficient path planning algorithm for practical applications such as autonomous driving, warehouse robot, and countless others. Sampling-based algorithms are widely used in these areas due to their good scalability and high efficiency. However, the quality of the initial path is not guaranteed and it takes much time to converge to the optimal path. To quickly obtain a high-quality initial path and accelerate the convergence speed, we propose the NRRT*. It utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution and achieves better performance. The NRRT* can be also applied to other sampling-based algorithms for improved results in different applications.},

  abstract = {Removing rain streaks from a single image has been drawing considerable attention as rain streaks can severely degrade the image quality and affect the performance of existing outdoor vision tasks. While recent CNN-based derainers have reported promising performances, deraining remains an open problem for two reasons. First, existing synthesized rain datasets have only limited realism, in terms of modeling real rain characteristics such as rain shape, direction and intensity. Second, there are no public benchmarks for quantitative comparisons on real rain images, which makes the current evaluation less objective. The core challenge is that real world rain/clean image pairs cannot be captured at the same time. In this paper, we address the single image rain removal problem in two ways. First, we propose a semi-automatic method that incorporates temporal priors and human supervision to generate a high-quality clean image from each input sequence of real rain images. Using this method, we construct a large-scale dataset of {$\sim$}29.5K rain/rain-free image pairs that covers a wide range of natural rain scenes. Second, to better cover the stochastic distribution of real rain streaks, we propose a novel SPatial Attentive Network (SPANet) to remove rain streaks in a local-to-global manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art deraining methods.},

The investigation on rain removal from video or a single image has thus been attracting much research attention in computer vision and pattern recognition, and various methods have been proposed against this task recently. However, there is still not a comprehensive survey paper to summarize current rain removal methods and fairly compare their generalization performance, and especially, still not a offthe-shelf toolkit to accumulate recent representative methods for easy performance comparison and capability evaluation. Aiming at this meaningful task, in this study we present a comprehensive review for current rain removal methods for video and a single image. Specifically, these methods are categorized into modeldriven and data-driven approaches, and more elaborate branches of each approach are further introduced. Intrinsic capabilities, especially generalization, of representative state-of-the-art methods of each approach have been evaluated and analyzed by experiments implemented on synthetic and real data both visually and quantitatively. Furthermore, we release a comprehensive repository, including direct links to 74 rain removal papers, source codes of 9 methods for video rain removal and 20 ones for single image rain removal, 19 related project pages, 6 synthetic datasets and 4 real ones, and 4 commonly used image quality metrics, to facilitate reproduction and performance comparison of current existing methods for general users.

In a cluttered environment, the cables can wrap around obstacles, but careful choice needs to be made for the initial cable configurations to ensure that the workspace of the robot is optimized. The presence of cables makes it imperative to consider the homotopy classes of the cables both in the design and motion planning problems. In this letter, we study the problem of workspace planning for multiple-cable controlled robots in an environment with polygonal obstacles. This letter's goal is to establish a relationship between the boundary of the workspace and cable configurations of such robots and solve related optimization and motion planning problems. We first analyze the conditions under which a configuration of a cable-controlled robot can be considered valid, discuss the relationship between cable configuration, the robot's workspace and its motion state, and using graph search based motion planning in h-augmented graph perform workspace optimization and compute optimal paths for the robot. We demonstrated the algorithms in simulations.},

  abstract = {Efficient trajectory optimization is essential for avoiding collisions in unstructured environments, but it remains challenging to have both speed and quality in the solutions. One reason is that second-order optimality requires calculating Hessian matrices that can grow with O(N2) with the number of waypoints. Decreasing the waypoints can quadratically decrease computation time. Unfortunately, fewer waypoints result in lower quality trajectories that may not avoid the collision. To have both, dense waypoints and reduced computation time, we took inspiration from recent studies on consensus optimization and propose a distributed formulation of collocated trajectory optimization. It breaks a long trajectory into several segments, where each segment becomes a subproblem of a few waypoints. These subproblems are solved classically, but in parallel, and the solutions are fused into a single trajectory with a consensus constraint that enforces continuity of the segments through a consensus update. With this scheme, the quadratic complexity is distributed to each segment and enables solving for higher-quality trajectories with denser waypoints. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is amenable to using any existing trajectory optimizer for solving the subproblems. We compare the performance of our implementation of trajectory splitting against leading motion planning algorithms and demonstrate the improved computational efficiency of our method.},

The learning-based controller is constructed with an actor-critic framework, and can perform a dual-channel continuous control (roll and speed) of the UAV. To overcome the fragility and volatility of original DDPG, three critical learning tricks are introduced in Robust-DDPG: (1) Delayed-learning trick, providing stable learnings, while facing dynamic environments; (2) adversarial attack trick, improving policy's adaptability to uncertain environments; (3) mixed exploration trick, enabling faster convergence of the model. The training experiments show great improvement in its convergence speed, convergence effect, and stability. The exploiting experiments demonstrate high efficiency in providing the UAV a shorter and smoother path. While, the generalization experiments verify its better adaptability to complicated, dynamic and uncertain environments, comparing to Deep Q Network (DQN) and DDPG algorithms.},

Most existing Retinex-based methods have carefully designed hand-crafted constraints and parameters for this highly ill-posed decomposition, which may be limited by model capacity when applied in various scenes. In this paper, we collect a LOw-Light dataset (LOL) containing low/normal-light image pairs and propose a deep Retinex-Net learned on this dataset, including a Decom-Net for decomposition and an Enhance-Net for illumination adjustment. In the training process for Decom-Net, there is no ground truth of decomposed reflectance and illumination. The network is learned with only key constraints including the consistent reflectance shared by paired low/normal-light images, and the smoothness of illumination. Based on the decomposition, subsequent lightness enhancement is conducted on illumination by an enhancement network called Enhance-Net, and for joint denoising there is a denoising operation on reflectance. The Retinex-Net is end-to-end trainable, so that the learned decomposition is by nature good for lightness adjustment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves visually pleasing quality for low-light enhancement but also provides a good representation of image decomposition.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of obstacle avoidance in simple 3D environments where the robot has to solely rely on a single monocular camera. In particular, we are interested in solving this problem without relying on localization, mapping, or planning techniques. Most of the existing work consider obstacle avoidance as two separate problems, namely obstacle detection, and control. Inspired by the recent advantages of deep reinforcement learning in Atari games and understanding highly complex situations in Go, we tackle the obstacle avoidance problem as a data-driven end-to-end deep learning approach. Our approach takes raw images as input and generates control commands as output. We show that discrete action spaces are outperforming continuous control commands in terms of expected average reward in maze-like environments. Furthermore, we show how to accelerate the learning and increase the robustness of the policy by incorporating predicted depth maps by a generative adversarial network.},

  abstract = {There are lots of innovative use cases possible that build on a shortest route between two locations together with a set of alternatives that are highly different yet short. Imagine, for example, a complicated building like an airport, where passengers can consult a computer terminal to get navigation advices to a desired goal. By scanning the boarding card the calculation of alternatives can be made context-sensitive. Based on gender, amount of time, or shopping preferences, for example, the terminal can display different routes regarding floors traversed, or shops and restaurants passed. Furthermore, the building operator can control the presentation of alternatives in order to influence visitor flows in real time. Therefore, we propose to use the topological concept of homotopy in order to decide if two routes should be considered equivalent or alternative. Basically, the homotopy relation identifies equivalence classes. We propose that a representative of an equivalence class is an alternative regarding another equivalence class. We concatenate the two routes in question and thus, create a polygon. If there is an obstacle inside, the routes are non-homotopic and we consider them as proper alternatives. For this situation, we propose two fundamentally different approaches that are able to find alternative routes with respect to homotopy. The input is a building plan in form of an occupancy grid. Bitmaps allow for fast calculation of the homotopy relation and can be generated from almost any type of environmental model. The first approach aims for enumerating routes that have to visit a special supporting point. This concatenation of two shortest paths leads to alternatives very fast. The second approach is orthogonal to that in the sense that it generates alternatives roughly ordered by their length. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the approaches' feasibility based on different metrics in several scenarios.},

Since centralized, coupled planning algorithms are computationally intractable for large numbers of robots, we consider decoupled planning, in which robots plan their paths sequentially in order of priority. Choosing how to prioritize the robots is a key consideration. State-of-the-art prioritization heuristics, however, do not model the coupling between a robot's mobility and its environment. This is particularly relevant when prioritizing between robots with different degrees of mobility. In this paper, we propose a prioritization rule that can be computed online by each robot independently, and that provides consistent, conflict-free path plans. Our innovation is to formalize a robot's path prospects to reach its goal from its current location. To this end, we consider the number of homology classes of trajectories, which capture distinct prospects of paths for each robot. This measure is used as a prioritization rule, whenever any robots enter negotiation to deconflict path plans. We perform simulations with heterogeneous robot teams and compare our method to five benchmarks. Our method achieves the highest success rate, and strikes a good balance between makespan and flowtime objectives.},

Decades of research and engineering have been dedicated to developing sophisticated navigation systems to move mobile robots from one point to another. Despite their overall success, a recently emerging research thrust is devoted to developing machine learning techniques to address the same problem, based in large part on the success of deep learning. However, to date, there has not been much direct comparison between the classical and emerging paradigms to this problem. In this article, we survey recent works that apply machine learning for motion planning and control in mobile robot navigation, within the context of classical navigation systems. The surveyed works are classified into different categories, which delineate the relationship of the learning approaches to classical methods. Based on this classification, we identify common challenges and promising future directions.},

The environment is partially known in the sense that there can be obstacles which are not a priori known to be included in the navigation function construction and used by the global planner. These obstacles are avoided reactively at the level of the local planner, which reacts to sensing information within the Field of View (fov) of the onboard sensors and keeps generating dynamically feasible safe trajectories along the segments generated by the global planner. The proposed motion planning strategy combines the advantages of global and reactive aerial navigation, producing locally optimal (in a minimum-jerk sense) vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the planner is demonstrated through realistic ros-Gazebo simulations.},

To assess the effect of heuristic functions for path planning algorithms, four commonly used heuristic functions of Manhattan distance, diagonal distance, Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance are used based on three simulation environments with different map size and complexity. Experimental results show that the heuristic function significantly affects the computing performance and the final path of path planning algorithms, and Manhattan distance is the most efficiency heuristic function for all the four path planning algorithms. We apply A*, D*, LPA* and D* Lite algorithms to static and dynamic environments, respectively with different map size and complexity. We find that A* has the best performance in relatively simple static environments. When the map size and complexity of the static environment is highly increased, D* Lite is the best choice. In contrast, D* Lite has the best performance for path planning in dynamic environments. However, we also find that A* also has an excellent performance in dynamic environments when the map size and complexity are decreased.},

Our core ideas lie in our new rain image model and new deep learning architecture. We add a binary map that provides rain streak locations to an existing model, which comprises a rain streak layer and a background layer. We create a model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method, a new contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual information and to produce better representations for rain detection. The evaluation on real images, particularly on heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our models and architecture.},

  abstract = {An efficient algorithm to solve the \$k\$ shortest non-homotopic path planning (\$k\$-SNPP) problem in a 2D environment is proposed in this paper. Motivated by accelerating the inefficient exploration of the homotopy-augmented space of the 2D environment, our fundamental idea is to identify the non-\$k\$-optimal path topologies as early as possible and terminate the pathfinding along them. This is a non-trivial practice because it has to be done at an intermediate state of the path planning process when locally shortest paths have not been fully constructed. In other words, the paths to be compared have not rendezvoused at the goal location, which makes the homotopy theory, modelling the spatial relationship among the paths having the same endpoint, not applicable. This paper is the first work that develops a systematic distance-based topology simplification mechanism to solve the \$k\$-SNPP task, whose core contribution is to assert the distance-based order of non-homotopic locally shortest paths before constructing them. If the order can be predicted, then those path topologies having more than \$k\$ better topologies are proven free of the desired \$k\$ paths and thus can be safely discarded during the path planning process. To this end, a hierarchical topological tree is proposed as an implementation of the mechanism, whose nodes are proven to expand in non-homotopic directions and edges (collision-free path segments) are proven locally shortest. With efficient criteria that observe the order relations between partly constructed locally shortest paths being imparted into the tree, the tree nodes that expand in non-\$k\$-optimal topologies will not be expanded. As a result, the computational time for solving the \$k\$-SNPP problem is reduced by near two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Path planning, the problem of efficiently discovering high-reward trajectories, often requires optimizing a high-dimensional and multimodal reward function. Popular approaches like CEM [37] and CMA-ES [16] greedily focus on promising regions of the search space and may get trapped in local maxima. DOO [31] and VOOT [22] balance exploration and exploitation, but use space partitioning strategies independent of the reward function to be optimized. Recently, LaMCTS [45] empirically learns to partition the search space in a reward-sensitive manner for black-box optimization. In this paper, we develop a novel formal regret analysis for when and why such an adaptive region partitioning scheme works. We also propose a new path planning method LaP3 which improves the function value estimation within each sub-region, and uses a latent representation of the search space. Empirically, LaP3 outperforms existing path planning methods in 2D navigation tasks, especially in the presence of difficult-to-escape local optima, and shows benefits when plugged into the planning components of model-based RL such as PETS [7]. These gains transfer to highly multimodal real-world tasks, where we outperform strong baselines in compiler phase ordering by up to 39\% on average across 9 tasks, and in molecular design by up to 0.4 on properties on a 0-1 scale.

In this paper, we propose a novel GCN model, which we term as Shortest Path Graph Attention Network (SPAGAN). Unlike conventional GCN models that carry out node-based attentions within each layer, the proposed SPAGAN conducts path-based attention that explicitly accounts for the influence of a sequence of nodes yielding the minimum cost, or shortest path, between the center node and its higher-order neighbors. SPAGAN therefore allows for a more informative and intact exploration of the graph structure and further a more effective aggregation of information from distant neighbors into the center node, as compared to node-based GCN methods. We test SPAGAN on the downstream classification task on several standard datasets, and achieve performances superior to the state of the art.},

However, these methods are limited in the sense that they can be trained only on fully labeled data. Due to various challenges in obtaining real world fully-labeled image deraining datasets, existing methods are trained only on synthetically generated data and hence, generalize poorly to real-world images. The use of real-world data in training image deraining networks is relatively less explored in the literature. We propose a Gaussian Process-based semi-supervised learning framework which enables the network in learning to derain using synthetic dataset while generalizing better using unlabeled real-world images. Through extensive experiments and ablations on several challenging datasets (such as Rain800, Rain200H and DDN-SIRR), we show that the proposed method, when trained on limited labeled data, achieves on-par performance with fully-labeled training.

Although many different path planning algorithms have been proposed to find optimal or near-optimal collision-free paths for UAVs, most of them either do not consider dynamic obstacle avoidance or do not incorporate multiple objectives. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective path planning (MOPP) framework to explore a suitable path for a UAV operating in a dynamic urban environment, where safety level is considered in the proposed framework to guarantee the safety of UAV in addition to travel time. To this aim, two types of safety index maps (SIMs) are developed first to capture static obstacles in the geography map and unexpected obstacles that are unavailable in the geography map. Then an MOPP method is proposed by jointly using offline and online search, where the offline search is based on the static SIM and helps shorten the travel time and avoid static obstacles, while the online search is based on the dynamic SIM of unexpected obstacles and helps bypass unexpected obstacles quickly. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework under the dynamic urban environment.},

Neural A* solves a path planning problem by encoding a problem instance to a guidance map and then performing the differentiable A* search with the guidance map. By learning to match the search results with ground-truth paths provided by experts, Neural A* can produce a path consistent with the ground truth accurately and efficiently.

In this paper, the modified wolf pack search (WPS) algorithm is applied to compute the quasi-optimal trajectories for the rotor wing UAVs in the complex three-dimensional (3D) spaces including the real and fake 3D spaces. Moreover, it adopts the multi-objective cost function. In the path planning process, some concepts in the genetic algorithm (GA) are applied to realize the WPS algorithm. Then, the crossover and mutation operators in the GA method are introduced to improve the original WPS algorithm. Considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle, the path smoothing process based on the cubic B-spline curve is used to make the planning path suitable for the fixed wing UAVs. Simulation results show that this approach is efficient for the rotor wing UAVs and the fixed wing UAVs when taking into account of all kinds of constraints and the path generated is flyable. Moreover, the comparisons of the four algorithms show that the trajectories produced by the modified WPS algorithm are far superior to the original WPS algorithm, the GA and the random search way under the same conditions.},

Checking collision with obstacles is the major computational bottleneck in this process. We propose new learning-based methods for reducing collision checking to accelerate motion planning by training graph neural networks (GNNs) that perform path exploration and path smoothing. Given random geometric graphs (RGGs) generated from batch sampling, the path exploration component iteratively predicts collision-free edges to prioritize their exploration. The path smoothing component then optimizes paths obtained from the exploration stage. The methods benefit from the ability of GNNs of capturing geometric patterns from RGGs through batch sampling and generalize better to unseen environments. Experimental results show that the learned components can significantly reduce collision checking and improve overall planning efficiency in challenging high-dimensional motion planning tasks.},

The present research on mobile robotics addresses the problems which are mainly on path planning algorithm and optimization in static as well as dynamic environments. A detailed review has been made in the broad field of mobile robotic research especially focussing on the path planning strategy in various cluttered environments, their advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies/methods have been highlighted. The path planning strategy of mobile robots can be categorised as Classical Methods and Heuristic Methods. Further subcategorized as (i) Analytical Methods, (ii) Enumerative Methods, (iii) Evolutionary Methods and (iv) Meta-Heuristic Methods. Each of these aforesaid methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, the main weakness arises from the fact that, analytical methods are too complex for intangible applications, whereas the enumerative methods are anxious by the extent of the search space. On the other hand, when search space is too large in path planning strategy, many evolutionary methods have been shown to be ineffective. To overcome these drawbacks, meta-heuristic methods have been fascinating considerably in this broad field of research. Many techniques are developed in path planning for mobile robot worldwide, however, the most commonly used techniques are presented here for further study.},

  abstract = {Due to the powerful fitting ability of neural networks and massive training data, data-driven Single Image Deraining (SID) methods have obtained significant performance, and most of existing studies focus on improving the performance by proposing different deraining networks. However, the generalization ability of current SID methods may still be limited in real scenario, and the deraining results also cannot effectively improve subsequent high-level tasks (e.g., object detection). The main reason may be because the current works mainly focus on designing new deraining networks, while neglecting the interpretation of the solving process. To investigate these issues, we in this paper re-examine the three factors (i.e.,data, rain model and network architecture) for the SID task, and specifically analyze them by proposing new and more reasonable criteria (i.e., general vs. specific, synthetical vs. mathematical, black-box vs. whitebox). We will also study the relationship of the three factors from new perspectives of data, and reveal two different solving paradigms (explicit vs. implicit) for SID. We further discuss the properties of the data-driven SID methods from five aspects, i.e., training strategy, network pipeline, domain knowledge, data preprocessing and objective function, with some useful conclusions provided by statistics. Besides, we also profoundly studied one of the three factors, i.e., data, and measured the performance of current methods on different datasets via extensive experiments to reveal the effectiveness of SID data. Finally, with the above comprehensive review and in-depth analysis, we also draw some instructive conclusions and valuable suggestions for the future research in this field.},

Removing snow from images thus is an important topic in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a Deep Dense Multi-Scale Network (DDMSNet) for snow removal by exploiting semantic and geometric priors. As images captured in outdoor often share similar scenes and their visibility varies with depth from camera, such semantic and geometric information provides a strong prior for snowy image restoration. We incorporate the semantic and geometric maps as input and learn the semantic-aware and geometry-aware representation to remove snow. In particular, we first create a coarse network to remove snow from the input images. Then, the coarsely desnowed images are fed into another network to obtain the semantic and geometric labels. Finally, we design a DDMSNet to learn semantic-aware and geometry-aware representation via a self-attention mechanism to produce the final clean images. Experiments evaluated on public synthetic and real-world snowy images verify the superiority of the proposed method, offering better results both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

  abstract = {Severe weather conditions such as rain and snow adversely affect the visual quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator. This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance.},

Nevertheless, many vision systems are sensitive to factors like the scattering of light or motion which may cause blur. This paper promotes an image enhancement method and is dedicated to reduce the adverse effects of blurred images on vision systems. We first researched the theory of indented frame over fusion (IFOF) and presented an automatic screening function. Then subtly combined color reversal, registration and transformation. Lastly, we tested two examples with this method and gained good results. Image processed by this method, facing strong scattering of light environment, has improved its quality and visual effects. With the development of this kind of technology, there will be more practical and intelligent applications in our lives, such as license plate numbers recognition in bad weather and important items search on fire scenes.},

This paper proposes an integrated algorithm combining the artificial potential field method and direct method for planning in a complex obstacle-rich environment. More realistic unmanned aerial vehicle dynamics equations, which are rarely applied in the traditional artificial potential field method, are considered in this paper. Furthermore, an additional control force is introduced to transcribe the artificial potential field model into an optimal control problem, and the equality/inequality constraints on the description of the shape of the obstacles are substituted by the repulsive force originating from all the obstacles. The Legendre pseudospectral method and virtual motion camouflage are both utilized to solve the modified optimal control problem for comparison purposes. The algorithm presented in this paper improves the performance of solving the trajectory-planning problem in an obstacle-rich environment. In particular, the algorithm is suitable for addressing some conditions that cannot be considered by the traditional artificial potential field method or direct method individually, such as local extreme value points and a large numbers of constraints. Two simulation examples, a single cube-shaped obstacle and a different-shaped obstacle-rich environment, are solved to demonstrate the capabilities and performance of the proposed algorithm.},

However, the convergence rate can be slow for high-dimensional planning problems, particularly for dynamical systems where the sampling space is not just the configuration space but the full state space. In this paper, we introduce the idea of using a partial-final-state-free (PFF) optimal controller in kinodynamic RRT* [1] to reduce the dimensionality of the sampling space. Instead of sampling the full state space, the proposed accelerated kinodynamic RRT*, called Kino-RRT*, only samples part of the state space, while the rest of the states are selected by the PFF optimal controller. We also propose a delayed and intermittent update of the optimal arrival time of all the edges in the RRT* tree to decrease the computation complexity. We tested the proposed algorithm using 4-D and 10-D state-space linear systems and showed that Kino-RRT* converges much faster than the kinodynamic RRT* algorithm.},

In this paper, we address the problem of generating likely motion trajectories for novel environments, represented as occupancy grid maps, where motion has not been observed. We introduce the Occupancy-Conditional Trajectory Network (OTNet) framework, capable of transferring the previously observed motion patterns in known environments to new environments. OTNet provides a functional representation for motion trajectories and utilises neural networks to learn occupancy-conditional distributions over the function parameters. We empirically demonstrate our method's ability to generate complex multi-modal trajectory patterns in both simulated and real-world environments.},

The main purpose of this work is that the UAVs can obtain an accident-free, shorter, and safer flight path between the starting point and the endpoint in the complex three-dimensional battlefield environment. Based on the characteristics of the standard BA and the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), a new modification of the BA algorithm is proposed in this work, namely, the improved bat algorithm integrated into the ABC algorithm (IBA). The IBA mainly uses ABC to modify the BA and solves the problem of poor local search ability of the BA. This article demonstrates the convergence of the IBA and performs simulations in MATLAB environment to verify its effectiveness. The simulations showed that the time required for the IBA to obtain the optimum solution is approximately 50\% lower than the BA, and that the quality of the optimum solution is about 14\% higher than the ABC. Furthermore, by comparing with other traditional and improved swarm intelligent path planning algorithms, the IBA can plan a faster, shorter, safer, accident-free flight path for UAVs. Finally, this article proves that IBA also has good performance in optimizing functions and has broad application potential.},

Given very limited time, existing methods have no strong guarantee on the feasibility or quality of the solutions. Moreover, most methods do not consider environment perception, which is the key bottleneck to fast flight. In this paper, we present RAPTOR, a robust and perception-aware replanning framework to support fast and safe flight. A path-guided optimization (PGO) approach that incorporates multiple topological paths is devised, to ensure finding feasible and high-quality trajectories in very limited time. We also introduce a perception-aware planning strategy to actively observe and avoid unknown obstacles. A risk-aware trajectory refinement ensures that unknown obstacles which may endanger the quadrotor can be observed earlier and avoid in time. The motion of yaw angle is planned to actively explore the surrounding space that is relevant for safe navigation. The proposed methods are tested extensively. We will release our implementation as an open-source package for the community.},

These algorithms include traditional planning algorithms, classical machine learning algorithms, optimal value reinforcement learning, and policy gradient reinforcement learning. Traditional planning algorithms investigated include graph search algorithms, sampling-based algorithms, interpolating curve algorithms, and reaction-based algorithms. Classical machine learning algorithms include multiclass support vector machine, long short-term memory, Monte-Carlo tree search and convolutional neural network. Optimal value reinforcement learning algorithms include Q learning, deep Q-learning network, double deep Q-learning network, dueling deep Q-learning network. Policy gradient algorithms include policy gradient method, actor-critic algorithm, asynchronous advantage actor-critic, advantage actor-critic, deterministic policy gradient, deep deterministic policy gradient, trust region policy optimization and proximal policy optimization. New general criteria are also introduced to evaluate the performance and application of motion planning algorithms by analytical comparisons. The convergence speed and stability of optimal value and policy gradient algorithms are specially analyzed. Future directions are presented analytically according to principles and analytical comparisons of motion planning algorithms. This paper provides researchers with a clear and comprehensive understanding about advantages, disadvantages, relationships, and future of motion planning algorithms in robots, and paves ways for better motion planning algorithms in academia, engineering, and manufacturing.},

We adopt a kinodynamic path searching method to find a safe, kinodynamic feasible, and minimum-time initial trajectory in the discretized control space. We improve the smoothness and clearance of the trajectory by a B-spline optimization, which incorporates gradient information from a Euclidean distance field and dynamic constraints efficiently utilizing the convex hull property of B-spline. Finally, by representing the final trajectory as a non-uniform B-spline, an iterative time adjustment method is adopted to guarantee dynamically feasible and non-conservative trajectories. We validate our proposed method in various complex simulational environments. The competence of the method is also validated in challenging real-world tasks. We release our code as an open-source package.},

The method incorporates two planning stages - an exploration stage for extending the boundary of the map, and a relocation stage for explicitly transiting the robot to different sub-areas in the environment. The exploration stage develops a local Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) in the free space of the environment, and the relocation stage maintains a global graph through the mapped environment, both are dynamically expanded over replanning steps. The method is compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in various challenging simulation and real environments. Experiment comparisons show that our method is twice as efficient in exploring spaces using less processing than the existing methods. Further, we release a benchmark environment to evaluate exploration algorithms as well as facilitate development of autonomous navigation systems. The benchmark environment and our method are open-sourced.},

The traversal order is limited by the linear or inside-outside manner. We propose a new set of coverage patterns induced from geometric folding operations, called the geometric folding pattern, to make coverage paths with more flexible traversal order. We study the modeling and parameterization of the geometric folding patterns. Then, a sampling operator is introduced. Based on the computational tools, we demonstrate the application of the proposed patterns in designing coverage paths. We show that the simple geometric folding patterns are flexible and controllable, which enables more choices for the coverage path planning problem.},

  abstract = {Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain \$X\$ to a target domain \$Y\$ in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping \$G: X \textbackslash rightarrow Y\$ such that the distribution of images from \$G(X)\$ is indistinguishable from the distribution \$Y\$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping \$F: Y \textbackslash rightarrow X\$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push \$F(G(X)) \textbackslash approx X\$ (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

  abstract = {In artificial intelligence, abstraction is commonly used to account for the use of various levels of details in a given representation language or the ability to change from one level to another while preserving useful properties. Abstraction has been mainly studied in problem solving, theorem proving, knowledge representation (in particular for spatial and temporal reasoning) and machine learning. In such contexts, abstraction is defined as a mapping between formalisms that reduces the computational complexity of the task at stake. By analysing the notion of abstraction from an information quantity point of view, we pinpoint the differences and the complementary role of reformulation and abstraction in any representation change. We contribute to extending the existing semantic theories of abstraction to be grounded on perception, where the notion of information quantity is easier to characterize formally. In the author's view, abstraction is best represented using abstraction operators, as they provide semantics for classifying different abstractions and support the automation of representation changes. The usefulness of a grounded theory of abstraction in the cartography domain is illustrated. Finally, the importance of explicitly representing abstraction for designing more autonomous and adaptive systems is discussed.},
