We propose a novel algorithm for avoiding deadlocks consisting of three stages: deadlock prediction, deadlock recovery, and deadlock recovery success prediction. Simple heuristics (such as the right-hand rule) are often used to avoid deadlocks. Such heuristics might reduce deadlock in simple configurations and sparsely populated environments, but they begin to fail in complex configurations and more densely populated environments. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using an open-source web-based multi-robot simulation. The results show that while the proposed algorithm does not eliminate the occurrence of deadlocks, it drastically reduces their occurrence, and leads to a considerable improvement in performance, especially in high-density environments. We also validate the real-world performance of the proposed algorithm in live experiments.},\n  eventtitle = {2021 {{IEEE}}/{{RSJ International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Robots}} and {{Systems}} ({{IROS}})},\n  keywords = {Collision avoidance,Heuristic algorithms,Intelligent robots,Open source software,Prediction algorithms,System recovery},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/3YXFFMZQ/Abdullhak and Vardy - 2021 - Deadlock Prediction and Recovery for Distributed C.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/S37EL9XU/9636609.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816763811,"version":0},"$loki":2427},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1097,"entry":"@article{abedReviewPathPlanning2021,\n  title = {A {{Review}} on {{Path Planning Algorithms}} for {{Mobile Robots}}},\n  author = {Abed, Mustafa S. and Lutfy, Omar F. and Al-Doori, Qusay F.},\n  date = {2021-05-25},\n  journaltitle = {Engineering and Technology Journal},\n  volume = {39},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {804--820},\n  publisher = {{University of Technology-Iraq}},\n  issn = {1681-6900},\n  doi = {10.30684/etj.v39i5A.1941},\n  url = {https://etj.uotechnology.edu.iq/article_169343.html},\n  urldate = {2022-08-09},\n  abstract = {Mobile robots use is rising every day.

As a result, they can often solve a sequence of similar planning problems faster than planning from scratch. State-of-the-art incremental heuristic searches (such as LPA*, D* and D* Lite) work by propagating cost changes to all the states in the search tree whose g values (the costs of computed paths from the start state) are no longer optimal. This work is based on the observation that while a complete propagation of cost changes is essential to ensure optimality, the propagations can be stopped earlier if we are looking close-to-optimal solutions instead of the optimal one. We develop a framework called Truncated Incremental Search that builds on this observation and uses a target suboptimality bound to efficiently restrict cost propagations. We present two truncation based algorithms, Truncated LPA* (TLPA*) and Truncated D* Lite (TD* Lite), for bounded suboptimal planning and navigation in dynamic graphs. We also develop an anytime replanning algorithm, Anytime Truncated D* (ATD*), that combines the inflated heuristic search with truncation, in an anytime manner. We discuss the theoretical properties of these algorithms proving their correctness and efficiency, and present experimental results on 2D and 3D (x, y, heading) path planning domains evaluating their performance. The empirical results show that the truncated incremental searches can provide significant improvement in runtime over existing incremental search algorithms, especially when searching for close-to-optimal solutions in large, dynamic graphs.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Anytime planning,Anytime search,Heuristic search,Incremental search,Planning,Replanning},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JVWSZ53L/Aine and Likhachev - 2016 - Truncated incremental search.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/7WABHVTV/S0004370216000163.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816763821,"version":0},"$loki":2430},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1016,"entry":"@article{aitsaadiUAVPathPlanning2022,\n  title = {{{UAV Path Planning Using Optimization Approaches}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{UAV Path Planning Using Optimization Approaches}}},\n  author = {Ait Saadi, Amylia and Soukane, Assia and Meraihi, Yassine and Benmessaoud Gabis, Asma and Mirjalili, Seyedali and Ramdane-Cherif, Amar},\n  date = {2022-04-18},\n  journaltitle = {Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Arch Computat Methods Eng},\n  issn = {1886-1784},\n  doi = {10.1007/s11831-022-09742-7},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s11831-022-09742-7},\n  urldate = {2022-07-27},\n  abstract = {Path planning is one of the most important steps in the navigation and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

The goal is to address one of the most critical problems in UAV design, namely weight constraints. Therefore, in order to reduce the weight, small batteries are used which affect the flight duration and overall performance. To increase the operating time during a mission, frequent recharging is typically required. To solve this problem, an autonomous air-to-air take-off and landing on a drone carrier for recharging is proposed. The main objective of this study is to calculate the minimum time and thus the shortest maneuver route between the UAV and the drone carrier. To achieve this goal, the path planning algorithm is utilized through the closed-loop direct optimal control approach to calculate the optimal time, which is defined as a cost function. In addition to the optimization techniques, the singular perturbation technique (SPT) and the Hamiltonian are used to solve and refine the optimal control problem (OCP).

Object detection is one of the methods used for autonomous vehicles to gather and report information about its environment during mission. With the ability to detect and classify objects, an unmanned vehicle can determine the type and number of objects around it and use this information in its autonomous motion and path planning or reporting the objects with the desired features. In an indoor environment, the data coming from an optic sensor provides enough capability to detect crossing points for an intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle such as doors, windows and stairs. However, sliding objects like windows and doors need to be classified as open or closed if this information will be used for path planning. Moreover, the crossing point's width needs to be calculated to ensure it is safe to go through it. So as to provide a robust navigation plan, LIDAR sensor data can be used to ensure object classification. In this study, a method to fuse LIDAR and optic sensors data has been developed and by the way a stronger object detection method is created. A crossing point is classified as an open/closed and determined whether to have enough space or not to pass through.

These applications belong to the civilian and the military fields. To name a few; infrastructure inspection, traffic patrolling, remote sensing, mapping, surveillance, rescuing humans and animals, environment monitoring, and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) operations. However, the use of UAVs in these applications needs a substantial level of autonomy. In other words, UAVs should have the ability to accomplish planned missions in unexpected situations without requiring human intervention. To ensure this level of autonomy, many artificial intelligence algorithms were designed. These algorithms targeted the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of UAVs. In this paper, we described the state of the art of one subset of these algorithms: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. We made a detailed description of them, and we deduced the current limitations in this area. We noted that most of these DRL methods were designed to ensure stable and smooth UAV navigation by training computer-simulated environments.

In [Bhattacharya, Kumar, Likhachev, AAAI 2010] we have shown how homotopy classes of trajectories on a two-dimensional plane with obstacles can be classified and identified using the Cauchy Integral Theorem and the Residue Theorem from Complex Analysis. In more recent work [Bhattacharya, Likhachev, Kumar, RSS 2011] we extended this representation to three-dimensional spaces by exploiting certain laws from the Theory of Electromagnetism (Biot-Savart law and Ampere's Law) for representing and identifying homotopy classes in three dimensions in an efficient way. Using such a representation, we showed that homotopy class constraints can be seamlessly weaved into graph search techniques for determining optimal path constrained to certain homotopy classes or forbidden from others, as well as for exploring different homotopy classes in an environment.

This problem is motivated by the use of boats with booms in skimming operations for cleaning oil spills or removing debris on the surface of the water. The goal in this paper is to automate the task of separating the objects of interest from a collection of objects by manipulating them with cables that are actuated only at the ends, and then transporting them to specified destinations. Because the cable is flexible, the shape of the cable must be explicitly modeled in the problem. Further, the robots must cooperatively plan motions to achieve the required cable shape and gross position/orientation to separate the objects of interest and then transport them as specified. The theoretical foundation for the problem is derived from topological invariants, homology and homotopy. We first derive the necessary topological conditions for achieving the desired separation of objects. We then propose a distributed search-based planning technique for finding optimal robot trajectories for separation and transportation. We demonstrate the applicability of this method using a dynamic simulation platform with explicit models of the cable dynamics, the contact between the cable and one or more objects, and the surface drag on the cable and on the objects. We also demonstrate the working of the proposed algorithm on an experimental platform consisting of a system of two cooperating autonomous surface vessels and stationary/anchored objects.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HNFJ4RB8/Bhattacharya et al. - 2015 - A topological approach to using cables to separate.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816763893,"version":0},"$loki":2457},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1198,"entry":"@article{bhattacharyaTopologicalConstraintsSearchbased2012,\n  title = {Topological Constraints in Search-Based Robot Path Planning},\n  author = {Bhattacharya, S. and Likhachev, M. and Kumar, V.},\n  date = {2012-10-01},\n  journaltitle = {Autonomous Robots},\n  shortjournal = {Auton Robot},\n  volume = {33},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {273--290},\n  issn = {1573-7527},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10514-012-9304-1},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-012-9304-1},\n  urldate = {2022-08-11},\n  abstract = {There are many applications in motion planning where it is important to consider and distinguish between different topological classes of trajectories.

In the standard formulation, a generalized plan is a mapping from feature or observation histories into actions, assuming that the instances share a common pool of features and actions. This assumption, however, excludes the standard relational planning domains where actions and objects change across instances. In this work, we extend the standard formulation of generalized planning to such domains. This is achieved by projecting the actions over the features, resulting in a common set of abstract actions which can be tested for soundness and completeness, and which can be used for generating general policies such as ‚Äúif the gripper is empty, pick the clear block above x and place it on the table‚Äù that achieve the goal clear(x) in any Blocksworld instance. In this policy, ‚Äúpick the clear block above x‚Äù is an abstract action that may represent the action Unstack(a, b) in one situation and the action Unstack(b, c) in another. Transformations are also introduced for computing such policies by means of fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planners.

The tree is precomputed and stored in memory to be used online to compute collision-free paths from the root of the tree to a particular goal node. In general, such a set of paths may be quite large, growing exponentially in the depth of the search tree. In practice, however, many of these paths may be close together and could be pruned without a loss to the overall problem of path-finding. The best such pruning for a given resulting tree size is the one that maximizes path diversity, which is quantified as the probability of the survival of paths, averaged over all possible obstacle environments. We formalize this notion and provide formulas for computing it exactly.

We first build on previous work of van Nieuwstadt and Murray and Mellinger and Kumar, to show how a search process can be coupled with optimization in the output space of a differentially flat vehicle model to find aggressive trajectories that utilize the full maneuvering capabilities of a quadrotor. We further extend this work to vehicles with complex, Dubins-type dynamics and present a novel trajectory representation called a ‚ÄúDubins‚ÄìPolynomial trajectory‚Äù, which allows us to optimize trajectories for fixed-wing vehicles. To provide accurate state estimation for aggressive flight, we show how the Gaussian particle filter can be extended to allow laser rangefinder localization to be combined with a Kalman filter. This formulation allows similar estimation accuracy to particle filtering in the full vehicle state but with an order of magnitude more efficiency. We conclude with experiments demonstrating the execution of quadrotor and fixed-wing trajectories in cluttered environments.

Existing methods use various constraints/priors to get plausible dehazing solutions. The key to achieve haze removal is to estimate a medium transmission map for an input hazy image. In this paper, we propose a trainable end-to-end system called DehazeNet, for medium transmission estimation. DehazeNet takes a hazy image as input, and outputs its medium transmission map that is subsequently used to recover a haze-free image via atmospheric scattering model. DehazeNet adopts Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based deep architecture, whose layers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors in image dehazing. Specifically, layers of Maxout units are used for feature extraction, which can generate almost all haze-relevant features. We also propose a novel nonlinear activation function in DehazeNet, called Bilateral Rectified Linear Unit (BReLU), which is able to improve the quality of recovered haze-free image. We establish connections between components of the proposed DehazeNet and those used in existing methods.

Towards this end, the paper in hand presents a novel local path planning method, incorporating the support vector machines (SVM) theory. The original SVM based module exploits a 2D map of points which are considered to be obstacles, so as to culminate in a collision free path. A unique attribute of the proposed SVM based local path planning algorithm is that it considers the consecutive positions of the global path trajectory, the embodiment of the robot and clusters the obstacles accordingly. Thus, the derived trajectory is a physically constrained path inasmuch as it considers the maximum margin notion of the SVM theory. Instead of providing a purely theoretical approach for local planning assessed using only artificial data, we integrate our local planner into an autonomous navigation system which is evaluated in real-world scenarios in order to show its efficacy. The latter framework firstly constructs a global 3D metric map of the perceived environment and then it converts it into a 2D map upon which a global path planner unrolls. The global map grows incrementally, by registering the collected point clouds over the robot‚Äôs route towards a goal position. Moreover, the navigation is supported by an obstacle detection strategy based on v-disparity images.

Our method builds on the fact that any trajectory of experience collected by an agent contains useful information about how to achieve the goals observed during that trajectory. We use this to train an ensemble of conditional generative models (GANs) to generate plausible trajectories that lead the agent from its current state towards a specified goal. We then combine these imagined trajectories into a novel planning algorithm in order to achieve the desired goal as efficiently as possible. The performance of PlanGAN has been tested on a number of robotic navigation/manipulation tasks in comparison with a range of model-free reinforcement learning baselines, including Hindsight Experience Replay.

Its efficiency however depends on the quality of heuristic function used. In fact, it has been shown that the correlation between the heuristic function and the true costto-goal significantly affects the efficiency of the search, when used with a large weight on the heuristics. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the problem of computing heuristics that explicitly aim to minimize the amount of search efforts in finding a feasible plan. The key observation we exploit is that while heuristics tries to guide the search along what looks like an optimal path towards the goal, there are other paths that are clearly sub-optimal yet are much easier to compute. For example, in motion planning domains like footstep-planning for humanoids, a heuristic that guides the search along a path away from obstacles is less likely to encounter local minima compared with the heuristics that guides the search along an optimal but close-to-obstacles path. We utilize this observation to define the concept of conservative heuristics and propose a simple algorithm for computing such a heuristic function.

The map planner determines the initial path using the improved jump point search method on the 2D map, and then it tries to optimize the path by considering a possible shorter 3D path. The point cloud planner is executed at a high frequency to generate the motion primitives. It makes the drone follow the solved path and avoid the suddenly appearing obstacles nearby.

Through the combination of sampling-based planning, a Rapidly Exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) and an efficient kinodynamic motion planner through machine learning, we propose an efficient solution to long-range planning for kinodynamic motion planning. First, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn an obstacle-avoiding policy that maps a robot's sensor observations to actions, which is used as a local planner during planning and as a controller during execution. Second, we train a reachability estimator in a supervised manner, which predicts the RL policy's time to reach a state in the presence of obstacles. Lastly, we introduce RL-RRT that uses the RL policy as a local planner, and the reachability estimator as the distance function to bias tree-growth towards promising regions. We evaluate our method on three kinodynamic systems, including physical robot experiments. Results across all three robots tested indicate that RL-RRT outperforms state of the art kinodynamic planners in efficiency, and also provides a shorter path finish time than a steering function free method.

The Euclidean distance between any two nodes in this space approximates the length of the shortest path between them in the given graph. Later, at runtime, a shortest path between any two nodes can be computed with an A* search using the Euclidean distances as heuristic. Our preprocessing algorithm, called FastMap, is inspired by the data-mining algorithm of the same name and runs in near-linear time. Hence, FastMap is orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches that produce a Euclidean embedding using Semidefinite Programming.

Moreover, FastMap applies to general undirected graphs for which many traditional heuristics, such as the Manhattan Distance heuristic, are not well defined.

Thus, to facilitate a deep understanding and further exploration of abstraction approaches for generalized planning, it is important to develop a uniform abstraction framework for generalized planning. Recently, Banihashemi et al. proposed an agent abstraction framework based on the situation calculus. However, expressiveness of such an abstraction framework is limited. In this paper, by extending their abstraction framework, we propose a uniform abstraction framework for generalized planning. We formalize a generalized planning problem as a triple of a basic action theory, a trajectory constraint, and a goal. Then we define the concepts of sound abstractions of a generalized planning problem. We show that solutions to a generalized planning problem are nicely related to those of its sound abstractions. We also define and analyze the dual notion of complete abstractions. Finally, we review some important abstraction works for generalized planning and show that they can be formalized in our framework.},\n  eventtitle = {Thirtieth {{International Joint Conference}} on {{Artificial Intelligence}} \\{\\vphantom\\}{{IJCAI-21}}\\vphantom\\{\\}},\n  isbn = {978-0-9992411-9-6},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/TMIXQ73T/Cui et al. - 2021 - A Uniform Abstraction Framework for Generalized Pl.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816763985,"version":0},"$loki":2495},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1146,"entry":"@article{danielThetaAnyAnglePath2010,\n  title = {Theta*: {{Any-Angle Path Planning}} on {{Grids}}},\n  shorttitle = {Theta*},\n  author = {Daniel, K. and Nash, A. and Koenig, S. and Felner, A.},\n  date = {2010-10-29},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research},\n  shortjournal = {jair},\n  volume = {39},\n  pages = {533--579},\n  issn = {1076-9757},\n  doi = {10.1613/jair.2994},\n  url = {https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10676},\n  urldate = {2022-08-10},\n  abstract = {Grids with blocked and unblocked cells are often used to represent terrain in computer games and robotics.

Prior approaches have used the faces of the obstacles themselves to define these convex regions. We instead use IRIS, a recently developed technique for greedy convex segmentation [1], to pre-compute convex regions of safe space. This results in a substantially reduced number of integer variables, which improves the speed with which the optimization can be solved to its global optimum, even for tens or hundreds of obstacle faces. In addition, prior approaches have typically enforced obstacle avoidance at a finite set of sample or knot points.

This characteristic is necessary for inspection robots that monitor the critical conditions of sectors in thermal, nuclear, and hydropower plants. This ability is also useful for applications such as service at home, victim rescue, museum guidance, land mine detection, and so forth. Multiple-target collision-free path planning is a topic that has not been very studied because of the complexity that it implies. Usually, this issue is left in second place because, commonly, it is solved by segmentation using the point-to-point strategy. Nevertheless, this approach exhibits a poor performance, in terms of path length, due to unnecessary turnings and redundant segments present in the found path. In this paper, a multiple-target method based on homotopy continuation capable to calculate a collision-free path in a single execution for complex environments is presented. This method exhibits a better performance, both in speed and efficiency, and robustness compared to the original Homotopic Path Planning Method (HPPM). Among the new schemes that improve their performance are the Double Spherical Tracking (DST), the dummy obstacle scheme, and a systematic criterion to a selection of repulsion parameter. The case studies show its effectiveness to find a solution path for office-like environments in just a few milliseconds, even if they have narrow corridors and hundreds of obstacles. Additionally, a comparison between the proposed method and sampling-based planning algorithms (SBP) with the best performance is presented. Furthermore, the results of case studies show that the proposed method exhibits a better performance than SBP algorithms for execution time, memory, and in some cases path length metrics. Finally, to validate the feasibility of the paths calculated by the proposed planner; two simulations using the pure-pursuit controlled and differential drive robot model contained in the Robotics System Toolbox of MATLAB are presented.},\n  issue = {11},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {autonomous mobile robot,homotopy based path planning,multiple-target path planning,path planning,piecewise linear approximation,robot motion},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/M9LJG9KE/Diaz-Arango et al. - 2020 - Multiple-Target Homotopic Quasi-Complete Path Plan.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/N7ABWHNU/3265.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764002,"version":0},"$loki":2503},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":411,"entry":"@article{diebelRepresentingAttitudeEuler,\n  title = {Representing {{Attitude}}: {{Euler Angles}}, {{Unit Quaternions}}, and {{Rotation Vectors}}},\n  author = {Diebel, James},\n  pages = {35},\n  abstract = {We present the three main mathematical constructs used to represent the attitude of a rigid body in threedimensional space.

Current deep reinforcement and imitation learning methods can learn directly from high-dimensional inputs but do not scale well to long-horizon tasks. In contrast, classical graphical methods like A* search are able to solve long-horizon tasks, but assume that the state space is abstracted away from raw sensory input. Recent works have attempted to combine the strengths of deep learning and classical planning; however, dominant methods in this domain are still quite brittle and scale poorly with the size of the environment. We introduce Sparse Graphical Memory (SGM), a new data structure that stores states and feasible transitions in a sparse memory. SGM aggregates states according to a novel two-way consistency objective, adapting classic state aggregation criteria to goal-conditioned RL: two states are redundant when they are interchangeable both as goals and as starting states. Theoretically, we prove that merging nodes according to two-way consistency leads to an increase in shortest path lengths that scales only linearly with the merging threshold. Experimentally, we show that SGM significantly outperforms current state of the art methods on long horizon, sparse-reward visual navigation tasks.

Furthermore, we show (1) its robustness to temporary loss of visual tracking and significant delays in the communication process, (2) the elimination of odometry drift as a result of the visual SLAM system and (3) accurate, scale-aware pose estimation and navigation.},\n  eventtitle = {2012 {{IEEE}}/{{RSJ International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Robots}} and {{Systems}}},\n  keywords = {Accuracy,Cameras,Delay,Navigation,Simultaneous localization and mapping,Visualization},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/Z74E6TYJ/Engel et al. - 2012 - Camera-based navigation of a low-cost quadrocopter.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/FY6NUIY6/6385458.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764021,"version":0},"$loki":2512},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1467,"entry":"@inproceedings{ericksonSurvivabilityMeasuringEnsuring2009,\n  title = {Survivability: {{Measuring}} and Ensuring Path Diversity},\n  shorttitle = {Survivability},\n  booktitle = {2009 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Robotics}} and {{Automation}}},\n  author = {Erickson, Lawrence H. and LaValle, Steven M.},\n  date = {2009-05},\n  pages = {2068--2073},\n  issn = {1050-4729},\n  doi = {10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152773},\n  abstract = {A novel criterion is introduced for assessing the diversity of a collection of paths or trajectories.

Planning algorithms effectively reason over long horizons, but assume access to a local policy and distance metric over collision-free paths. Reinforcement learning excels at learning policies and relative values of states, but fails to plan over long horizons. Despite the successes of each method on various tasks, long horizon, sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional observations remain exceedingly challenging for both planning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Frustratingly, these sorts of tasks are potentially the most useful, as they are simple to design (a human only need to provide an example goal state) and avoid injecting bias through reward shaping. We introduce a general-purpose control algorithm that combines the strengths of planning and reinforcement learning to effectively solve these tasks. Our main idea is to decompose the task of reaching a distant goal state into a sequence of easier tasks, each of which corresponds to reaching a particular subgoal. We use goal-conditioned RL to learn a policy to reach each waypoint and to learn a distance metric for search. Using graph search over our replay buffer, we can automatically generate this sequence of subgoals, even in image-based environments. Our algorithm, search on the replay buffer (SoRB), enables agents to solve sparse reward tasks over hundreds of steps, and generalizes substantially better than standard RL algorithms.},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/DJ2SD2U7/Eysenbach et al. - 2019 - Search on the Replay Buffer Bridging Planning and.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764027,"version":0},"$loki":2515},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1391,"entry":"@misc{farberTopologicalComplexityCollision2006,\n  title = {Topological Complexity of Collision Free Motion Planning Algorithms in the Presence of Multiple Moving Obstacles},\n  author = {Farber, Michael and Grant, Mark and Yuzvinsky, Sergey},\n  date = {2006-09-17},\n  number = {arXiv:math/0609476},\n  eprint = {math/0609476},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  publisher = {{arXiv}},\n  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.math/0609476},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0609476},\n  urldate = {2022-09-14},\n  abstract = {We study motion planning algorithms for collision free control of multiple objects in the presence of moving obstacles.

We use methods of algebraic topology (the Lusternik‚ÄîSchnirelman theory) to study the topological complexity TC(X) . We give an upper bound for TC(X)  (in terms of the dimension of the configuration space X ) and also a lower bound (in terms of the structure of the cohomology algebra of X ).

However, large regions of the environment are typically benign enough that a much faster low-dimensional planning combined with a local path following controller suffice. Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality that was recently developed makes use of this observation and iteratively constructs and searches a state-space consisting of mainly low-dimensional states. It only introduces regions of high-dimensional states into the state-space where they are necessary to ensure completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. However, due to its iterative nature, the approach relies on running a series of weighted A* searches. In this paper, we introduce and apply to Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality a simple but very effective incremental version of weighted A* that reuses its previously generated search tree if available. On the theoretical side, the new algorithm preserves guarantees on completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. On the experimental side, it speeds up 3D (x,y,heading) path planning with a full-body collision checking by up to a factor of 5.

In this paper, we present a planning algorithm intended to speed up path planning for high-dimensional state-spaces such as robotic arms. The idea behind this work is that while planning in a high-dimensional state-space is often necessary to ensure the feasibilityof the resulting path, large portions of the path have a lower-dimensional structure. Based on this observation, our algorithm iteratively constructs a state-space of an adaptive dimensionality--a state-space that is high-dimensional only where the higher dimensionality is absolutely necessary for finding a feasible path. This often reduces drastically the size of the state-space, and as a result, the planning time and memory requirements. Analytically, we show that our method is complete and is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, within a specified suboptimality bound. Experimentally, we apply the approach to 3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading), and to a 7 DOF robotic arm on the Willow Garage\\&rsquo;s PR2 robot.

Specifically, we consider the problem of humans and robots cooperatively searching an indoor environment in a distributed manner where we assume that each robot is equipped with sensors that are able to locate targets of interest. Rather than have humans issue explicit commands to and guide robots, we allow humans to make decisions on their own and let the robots adapt to decisions taken by the human. The main contribution of this paper is a framework in which the robots in the team respond and adapt to the behavior of the human agents in the task of exploring and clearing an indoor environment. The central idea is the assignment of robots to homotopy classes that are complementary to the classes being pursued by human agents. By the virtue of the sparse topological representation of the agent trajectories, our algorithm lends itself naturally to a distributed implementation. The framework has three advantages: it (a) ensures that robots and humans pursue different homotopy classes; (b) requires very little communication between the humans and the robots; and (c) allows robots to adapt to human movement without having to model complex human decision-making behaviors.

Second, it provides the ability to combine (i) synthetic exteroceptive measurements generated in silico in real time and (ii) vehicle dynamics and proprioceptive measurements generated in motio by vehicle(s) in flight in a motion-capture facility. FlightGoggles is capable of simulating a virtual-reality environment around autonomous vehicle(s) in flight. While a vehicle is in flight in the Flight-Goggles virtual reality environment, exteroceptive sensors are rendered synthetically in real time while all complex dynamics are generated organically through natural interactions of the vehicle. The FlightGoggles framework allows for researchers to accelerate development by circumventing the need to estimate complex and hard-to-model interactions such as aerodynamics, motor mechanics, battery electrochemistry, and behavior of other agents. The ability to perform vehicle-in-the-loop experiments with photorealistic exteroceptive sensor simulation facilitates novel research directions involving, e.g., fast and agile autonomous flight in obstacle-rich environments, safe human interaction, and flexible sensor selection. FlightGoggles has been utilized as the main test for selecting nine teams that will advance in the AlphaPilot autonomous drone racing challenge.

The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathfinding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identifies and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points.

Motion planning methods for autonomous driving and mobile robots typically need to rely on the spatial constraints imposed by a map-based global planner to generate a collision-free trajectory. These methods may fail without an offline map or where the map is invalid due to dynamic changes in the environment such as road obstruction, construction, and traffic congestion. To address this problem, triangulation-based methods can be used to obtain a spatial constraint. However, the existing methods fall short when dealing with dynamic environments and may lead the motion planner to an unrecoverable state. In this paper, we propose a new method to generate a sequence of channels across different triangulation mesh topologies to serve as the spatial constraints.

Traditionally, these samples are drawn either probabilistically or deterministically to uniformly cover the state space. Yet, the motion of many robotic systems is often restricted to \"small\" regions of the state space, due to, for example, differential constraints or collision-avoidance constraints. To accelerate the planning process, it is thus desirable to devise non-uniform sampling strategies that favor sampling in those regions where an optimal solution might lie. This paper proposes a methodology for non-uniform sampling, whereby a sampling distribution is learned from demonstrations, and then used to bias sampling. The sampling distribution is computed through a conditional variational autoencoder, allowing sample generation from the latent space conditioned on the specific planning problem. This methodology is general, can be used in combination with any sampling-based planner, and can effectively exploit the underlying structure of a planning problem while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of sampling-based approaches. Specifically, on several planning problems, the proposed methodology is shown to effectively learn representations for the relevant regions of the state space, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in terms of success rate and convergence to the optimal cost.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords = {Computer Science - Machine Learning,Computer Science - Robotics},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8EIUN3AL/Ichter et al. - 2019 - Learning Sampling Distributions for Robot Motion P.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HH4R42R2/1709.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764102,"version":0},"$loki":2557},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1482,"entry":"@article{ilesanmiMethodsImageDenoising2021,\n  title = {Methods for Image Denoising Using Convolutional Neural Network: A Review},\n  shorttitle = {Methods for Image Denoising Using Convolutional Neural Network},\n  author = {Ilesanmi, Ademola E. and Ilesanmi, Taiwo O.},\n  date = {2021-10},\n  journaltitle = {Complex \\& Intelligent Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Complex Intell.

That is, while dealing with uncertainties, a motion planner must update its trajectory, adapting to the newly revealed environment in real-time; failing to do so may involve unsafe circumstances. Many existing planning algorithms guarantee these by maintaining the clearance needed to perform an emergency brake, which is itself a robust and persistently feasible maneuver. However, such maneuvers are not applicable for systems in which braking is impossible or risky, such as fixed-wing aircraft. To that end, we propose a real-time robust planner that recursively guarantees persistent feasibility without any need of braking. The planner ensures robustness against bounded uncertainties and persistent feasibility by constructing a loop of sequentially composed funnels, starting from the receding horizon local trajectory‚Äôs forward reachable set. We implement the proposed algorithm for a robotic car tracking a speed-fixed reference trajectory.

Through extensive experiments, our proposed approach outperforms recent methods under a variety of metrics in terms of visual quality and subjective user study.

Video quality enhancement can improve the visual quality of surveillance videos providing clearer images with more details. Existing work in this area mainly focuses on quality enhancement for high resolution videos or still images, but few algorithms are developed for enhancing surveillance videos, which normally have low resolution, high noise and compression artifacts. In addition, for snow or rain conditions, the image quality of near-filed view is degraded by the obscuration of apparent snowflakes and raindrops, while the quality of far field view is degraded by the obscuration of fog-like snowflakes or raindrops. Very few video quality enhancement algorithms have been developed to handle both problems. In this paper, we propose a novel video quality enhancement algorithm for see-through snow, fog or heavy rain. The proposed algorithm has two major steps: 1. the near-field enhancement algorithm identifies obscuration pixels by snow or rain in the near-field view and removes these pixels as snowflakes or rain drops; different from state-of-the-art methods, the algorithm in this step can detect snowflakes on foreground object and background, and choose different methods to fill in the removed regions. 2. the far-field enhancement algorithm restores the image's contrast information not only to reveal more details in the far-field view but also to enhance the overall image's quality; in this step, the proposed algorithm adaptively enhances the global and local contrast, which is inspired on the human visual system, and accounts for the perceptual sensitivity to noise, compression artifacts, and the texture of image content.

However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms have been established so far. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely.

However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts.

This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom.

The explainable model is on a visual platform in the format of if-then rules derived from the Sugeno-type fuzzy inference model. The model is tested using the data recorded from three different missions. In each mission, adverse weather, conditions and enemy locations are introduced at random locations along the path of the mission. There are two phases to the model development. In the first phase, the Mamdani fuzzy model is used to create rules to steer the UAV along the designated mission and the rules of engagement when it encounters weather and enemy locations along and near its chosen mission. The data are gathered as UAV traverses on each mission. In the second phase, the data gathered from these missions are used to create a reverse model using a Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system based on the subtractive clustering in the data. The model has seven inputs (time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, heading direction, engage in attack, continue mission, and steer UAV) and two outputs (weather conditions and distance from the enemy). This model predicts the outputs regarding the weather conditions and enemy positions whenever UAV deviates from the predefined path. The model is optimized with respect to the number of rules and prediction accuracy by adjusting subtractive clustering parameters. The model is then fine-tuned with ANFIS. The final model has six rules and root mean square error value that is less than 0.05. Furthermore, to check the robustness of the model, the Gaussian random noise is added to a UAV path, and the prediction accuracy is validated.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE Access}}},\n  keywords = {ANFIS,Atmospheric modeling,Data models,Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI),fuzzy logic,Fuzzy logic,Fuzzy sets,Machine learning,Predictive models,subtractive clustering,unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),Unmanned aerial vehicles}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764146,"version":0},"$loki":2575},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1133,"entry":"@inproceedings{khaksarReviewMobileRobots2015,\n  title = {A Review on Mobile Robots Motion Path Planning in Unknown Environments},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE International Symposium}} on {{Robotics}} and {{Intelligent Sensors}} ({{IRIS}})},\n  author = {Khaksar, Weria and Vivekananthen, S. and Saharia, Khairul Salleh Mohamed and Yousefi, Moslem and Ismail, Firas B.},\n  date = {2015-10},\n  pages = {295--300},\n  doi = {10.1109/IRIS.2015.7451628},\n  abstract = {Robotics sector have achieved enormous founds in recent years due to its high demands in factories to carry out high-precision jobs like riveting and welding.

One of the limitations which UAV suffers while covering distributed multiple regions is energy constraints where complete area coverage is not possible. From a strategical point of view, we propose a novel algorithm which solves a variant of area coverage problem where the UAV aims to achieve near-optimal area coverage due to path length limitation caused by the energy constraint. In this paper, a preliminary study is conducted by first formulating the problem and later on presenting a solution.

However, it is computationally too expensive to compute this space a-priori. Instead, in this paper, we show how we can plan using a recently-developed variant of A* search, called Multi-Heuristic A*. Normally, the Multi-Heuristic A* algorithm takes in a fixed set of heuristic functions. In our problem, however, the heuristics represent length of paths to the goal along different topology classes, and there can be too many of them and not all the topology classes are useful. To deal with this, we adapt Multi-Heuristic A* to work with a dynamically generated set of heuristic functions. It starts out as a normal weighted A*. Whenever the search gets trapped in a local minimum, we find the proper topology class of the path to escape from it and add the corresponding new heuristic function into the set of heuristic functions considered by the search.

The unknown, yet-to-be-explored area is mapped to a single point, thus giving us a quotient space. The topological classes on the quotient space allows us to define topological classes of trajectories connecting a robot pose to the unknown region in the original configuration space. Robots explore this configuration space choosing different homology classes when confronted by obstacles or walls. We illustrate the basic idea with simulations of small teams of robots. Experiments with a single robot illustrate the applicability of the method to robots that have small sensor footprints and limited computational resources.

For stable visual navigation, MAVs should generate perception-aware paths which guarantee enough visible landmarks. Many previous works on perception-aware path planning focused on sampling-based planners. However, they may suffer from sample inefficiency, which leads to computational burden for finding a global optimal path. To address this issue, we suggest a perception-aware path planner which utilizes topological information of environments. Since the topological class of a path and visible landmarks during traveling the path are closely related, the proposed algorithm checks distinctive topological classes to choose the class with abundant visual information. Topological graph is extracted from the generalized Voronoi diagram of the environment and initial paths with different topological classes are found. To evaluate the perception quality of the classes, we divide the initial path into discrete segments where the points in each segment share similar visual information. The optimal class with high perception quality is selected, and a graph-based planner is utilized to generate path within the class. With simulations and real-world experiments, we confirmed that the proposed method could guarantee accurate visual navigation compared with the perception-agnostic method while showing improved computational efficiency than the sampling-based perception-aware planner.},\n  eventtitle = {2021 {{IEEE}}/{{RSJ International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Robots}} and {{Systems}} ({{IROS}})},\n  keywords = {Computational efficiency,Computational modeling,Navigation,Path planning,Reliability,State estimation,Visualization},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/PY4BJ63H/Kim et al. - 2021 - Topology-Guided Path Planning for Reliable Visual .pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/5Z768WPH/9636469.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764161,"version":0},"$loki":2583},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1264,"entry":"@inproceedings{kimTrajectoryPlanningSystems2012,\n  title = {Trajectory {{Planning}} for {{Systems}} with {{Homotopy Class Constraints}}},\n  booktitle = {Latest {{Advances}} in {{Robot Kinematics}}},\n  author = {Kim, Soonkyum and Sreenath, Koushil and Bhattacharya, Subhrajit and Kumar, Vijay},\n  editor = {Lenarcic, Jadran and Husty, Manfred},\n  date = {2012},\n  pages = {83--90},\n  publisher = {{Springer Netherlands}},\n  location = {{Dordrecht}},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-94-007-4620-6_11},\n  abstract = {There are various applications where homotopy constraints are useful in trajectory generation for mobile robots.

Secondly, the data structure is then utilized to decide between future navigation goals. This approach is compared to the class of nearest neighbor exploration algorithms and a decision theoretic approach.

It does not support optimization of the overall flight time of the multi-goal trajectory by exploiting higher speeds for longer turning radii. Therefore, we propose a novel problem formulation called the Variable-Speed Traveling Salesman Problem (VS-TSP) that employs time-efficient trajectories with variable speed based on a generalization of the Dubins vehicle model, allowing multiple turning radii and change of the forward speed of the vehicle. The VS-TSP allows the vehicle to slow down if high maneuverability is necessary and speed up if high-speed turns with a large radius are beneficial to the overall tour cost.

An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed.

The RAPPIDS motion planner generates collision-free flight trajectories at high speed with low computational cost using only the latest depth image. In this work we extend it to improve the performance of the planner by taking the following issues into account. (a) Changes in the dynamic characteristics of the multicopter that occur during flight, such as changes in motor input/output characteristics due to battery voltage drop. (b) The noise of the flight sensor, which can cause unwanted control input components. (c) Planner utility function which may not be suitable for the cluttered environment. Therefore, in this paper we introduce solutions to each of the above problems and propose a system for the successful operation of the RAPPIDS planner in an outdoor cluttered flight environment. At the end of the paper, we validate the proposed method's effectiveness by presenting the flight experiment results in a forest environment.

However, while much work in the area focuses on specific tasks in drone navigation, the contribution to the overall goal of autonomy is often not assessed, and a comprehensive overview is needed. In this work, a taxonomy of drone navigation autonomy is established by mapping the definitions of vehicular autonomy levels, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, to specific drone tasks in order to create a clear definition of autonomy when applied to drones. A top‚Äìdown examination of research work in the area is conducted, focusing on drone navigation tasks, in order to understand the extent of research activity in each area. Autonomy levels are cross-checked against the drone navigation tasks addressed in each work to provide a framework for understanding the trajectory of current research.

While historically the problem has been addressed with filtering, advancements in visual estimation suggest that nonlinear optimization offers superior accuracy, while still tractable in complexity thanks to the sparsity of the underlying problem. Taking inspiration from these findings, we formulate a rigorously probabilistic cost function that combines reprojection errors of landmarks and inertial terms. The problem is kept tractable and thus ensuring real-time operation by limiting the optimization to a bounded window of keyframes through marginalization. Keyframes may be spaced in time by arbitrary intervals, while still related by linearized inertial terms. We present evaluation results on complementary datasets recorded with our custom-built stereo visual‚Äìinertial hardware that accurately synchronizes accelerometer and gyroscope measurements with imagery. A comparison of both a stereo and monocular version of our algorithm with and without online extrinsics estimation is shown with respect to ground truth. Furthermore, we compare the performance to an implementation of a state-of-the-art stochastic cloning sliding-window filter.

Yet UAV path planning under various safety risks, such as crash and collision, is not an easy task, due to the complicated and dynamic nature of path environments. Therefore, developing an efficient and flexible algorithm for UAV path planning has become inevitable. Aimed at quality-oriented UAV path planning, this paper is designed to analyze UAV path planning from two aspects: global static planning and local dynamic hierarchical planning. Through a theoretical and mathematical approach, a three-dimensional UAV path planning model was established. Based on the A* algorithm, the search strategy, the step size, and the cost function were improved, and the OPEN set was simplified, thereby shortening the planning time and greatly improving the execution efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, a dynamic exploration factor was added to the exploration mechanism of Q-learning to solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma of Q-learning to adapt to the local dynamic path adjustment for UAVs. The global-local hybrid UAV path planning algorithm was formed by combining the two. The simulation results indicate that the proposed planning model and algorithm can efficiently solve the problem of UAV path planning, improve the path quality, and can be a significant reference for solving other problems related to path planning, such as the reliability, security, and safety of UAV, when embedded into the heuristic function of the proposed algorithm.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE Access}}},\n  keywords = {A* algorithm,Autonomous aerial vehicles,Costs,Heuristic algorithms,hierarchical planning,Path planning,Planning,Q-learning,quality-oriented path planning,reinforcement learning,Turning,Unmanned aerial vehicle},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/GSYXLWPX/Li et al. - 2022 - Quality-Oriented Hybrid Path Planning Based on A .pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2GJWIBQ2/9665744.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764215,"version":0},"$loki":2609},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1035,"entry":"@inproceedings{liSurveyRobotPath2019,\n  title = {A {{Survey}} on {{Robot Path Planning}} Using {{Bio-inspired Algorithms}}},\n  booktitle = {2019 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Robotics}} and {{Biomimetics}} ({{ROBIO}})},\n  author = {Li, Junfei and Yang, Simon X. and Xu, Zhe},\n  date = {2019-12},\n  pages = {2111--2116},\n  doi = {10.1109/ROBIO49542.2019.8961498},\n  abstract = {The path planning problem has been an essential topic in autonomous robotics.

Different from additive rain streaks, in such occlusion regions, the details of backgrounds are completely lost. Therefore, we propose a hybrid rain model to depict both rain streaks and occlusions. Integrating the hybrid model and useful motion segmentation context information, we present a Dynamic Routing Residue Recurrent Network (D3R-Net). D3R-Net first extracts the spatial features by a residual network. Then, the spatial features are aggregated by recurrent units along the temporal axis. In the temporal fusion, the context information is embedded into the network in a ‚Äúdynamic routing‚Äù way. A heap of recurrent units takes responsibility for handling the temporal fusion in given contexts, e.g., rain or non-rain regions. In the certain forward and backward processes, one of these recurrent units is mainly activated. Then, a context selection gate is employed to detect the context and select one of these temporally fused features generated by these recurrent units as the final fused feature. Finally, this last feature plays a role of ‚Äúresidual feature.‚Äù It is combined with the spatial feature and then used to reconstruct the negative rain streaks. In such a D3R-Net, we incorporate motion segmentation, which denotes whether a pixel belongs to fast moving edges or not, and rain type indicator, indicating whether a pixel belongs to rain streaks, rain occlusions, and non-rain regions, as the context variables. Extensive experiments on a series of synthetic and real videos with rain streaks verify not only the superiority of the proposed method over state of the art but also the effectiveness of our network design and its each component.

Although computing k-survivability is expensive and this work is still preliminary, we believe that understanding the relationship between diversity and survival will yield new insights into multirobot motion planning.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE Robotics}} and {{Automation Letters}}},\n  keywords = {Art,Buildings,Libraries,Measurement,Motion and Path Planning,Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents,Planning,Probability and Statistical Methods,Redundant Robots,Roads,Robots,Search and Rescue Robots},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/29APBDER/Lyu et al. - 2016 - $k$-Survivability Diversity and Survival of Expen.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XUZ5856T/7396947.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764240,"version":0},"$loki":2624},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1081,"entry":"@article{macHeuristicApproachesRobot2016,\n  title = {Heuristic Approaches in Robot Path Planning: {{A}} Survey},\n  shorttitle = {Heuristic Approaches in Robot Path Planning},\n  author = {Mac, Thi Thoa and Copot, Cosmin and Tran, Duc Trung and De Keyser, Robin},\n  date = {2016-12-01},\n  journaltitle = {Robotics and Autonomous Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Robotics and Autonomous Systems},\n  volume = {86},\n  pages = {13--28},\n  issn = {0921-8890},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.robot.2016.08.001},\n  url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889015300671},\n  urldate = {2022-08-09},\n  abstract = {Autonomous navigation of a robot is a promising research domain due to its extensive applications.

Effective understanding of the surrounding environment and efficient generation of an optimal collision-free path are both critical parts for solving path-planning problems. Although conventional sampling-based algorithms, such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) and its improved optimal version (RRT*), have been widely used in path-planning problems because of their ability to find a feasible path in even complex environments, they fail to find an optimal path efficiently. To solve this problem and satisfy the two aforementioned requirements, we propose a novel learning-based path-planning algorithm which consists of a novel generative model based on the conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) and a modified RRT* algorithm (denoted by CGAN-RRT*). Given the map information, our CGAN model can generate an efficient probability distribution of feasible paths, which can be utilized by the CGAN-RRT* algorithm to find an optimal path with a nonuniform sampling strategy. The CGAN model is trained by learning from ground-truth maps, each of which is generated by putting all the results of executing the RRT algorithm 50 times on one raw map. We demonstrate the efficient performance of this CGAN model by testing it on two groups of maps and comparing the CGAN-RRT* algorithm with the Informed-RRT* algorithm and conventional RRT* algorithm.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE Transactions}} on {{Cognitive}} and {{Developmental Systems}}},\n  keywords = {Collision avoidance,Conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs),Gallium nitride,Heuristic algorithms,optimal path planning,Path planning,Prediction algorithms,Predictive models,Probability distribution,sampling-based path planning},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WVSSBLVK/Ma et al. - 2022 - Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Op.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/P4BJMK7X/9366777.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764244,"version":0},"$loki":2626},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":159,"entry":"@article{mahonyMultirotorAerialVehicles2012,\n  title = {Multirotor {{Aerial Vehicles}}: {{Modeling}}, {{Estimation}}, and {{Control}} of {{Quadrotor}}},\n  shorttitle = {Multirotor {{Aerial Vehicles}}},\n  author = {Mahony, Robert and Kumar, Vijay and Corke, Peter},\n  date = {2012-09},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Robotics Automation Magazine},\n  volume = {19},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {20--32},\n  issn = {1558-223X},\n  doi = {10.1109/MRA.2012.2206474},\n  abstract = {This article provides a tutorial introduction to modeling, estimation, and control formultirotor aerial vehicles that includes the common four-rotor or quadrotor case.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE Robotics Automation Magazine}}},\n  keywords = {Aerodynamics,Aircraft manufacture,Atmospheric modeling,Blades,Estimation,Modeling,Rotors,Tutorials},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/ZCSUA2DV/Mahony et al. - 2012 - Multirotor Aerial Vehicles Modeling, Estimation, .pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/ZWBH63GP/6289431.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764246,"version":0},"$loki":2627},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":116,"entry":"@book{majeedRecentDevelopmentsPath2021,\n  title = {Recent {{Developments}} in {{Path Planning}} for {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles}}},\n  author = {Majeed, Abdul and Hwang, Seong Oun},\n  date = {2021-09-15},\n  journaltitle = {Motion Planning},\n  publisher = {{IntechOpen}},\n  doi = {10.5772/intechopen.99576},\n  url = {https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/78404},\n  urldate = {2022-04-20},\n  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in performing diverse missions at significantly lower costs compared to the human beings.

Doing so comes at the expense of search effort, i.e., LazySP must recompute the search tree every time an edge is found to be invalid. This becomes prohibitively expensive when dealing with large graphs or highly cluttered environments. Our key insight is the need to balance both edge evaluation and search effort to minimize the total planning time. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a framework, Generalized Lazy Search (GLS), that seamlessly toggles between search and evaluation to prevent wasted efforts. We show that for a choice of toggle, GLS is provably more efficient than LazySP. Second, we leverage prior experience of edge probabilities to derive GLS policies that minimize expected planning time.

This problem is particularly acute in human and animal cognition given the limited capacity of working memory, and the time pressures under which planning often occurs in the natural environment. Hierarchically organized modular representations have long been suggested to underlie the capacity of biological systems to efficiently and flexibly plan in complex environments. However, the principles underlying efficient modularization remain obscure, making it difficult to identify its behavioral and neural signatures. Here, we develop a normative theory of efficient state-space representations which partitions an environment into distinct modules by minimizing the average (information theoretic) description length of planning within the environment, thereby optimally trading off the complexity of planning across and within modules. We show that such optimal representations provide a unifying account for a diverse range of hitherto unrelated phenomena at multiple levels of behavior and neural representation.},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/NSIN6ZKD/McNamee et al. - 2016 - Efficient state-space modularization for planning.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764254,"version":0},"$loki":2632},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":433,"entry":"@article{mehraReViewNetFastResource2021,\n  title = {{{ReViewNet}}: {{A Fast}} and {{Resource Optimized Network}} for {{Enabling Safe Autonomous Driving}} in {{Hazy Weather Conditions}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{ReViewNet}}},\n  author = {Mehra, Aryan and Mandal, Murari and Narang, Pratik and Chamola, Vinay},\n  date = {2021-07},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  volume = {22},\n  number = {7},\n  pages = {4256--4266},\n  issn = {1558-0016},\n  doi = {10.1109/TITS.2020.3013099},\n  abstract = {Adverse weather conditions such as fog, haze, snow, mist and glare create visibility problems for applications of autonomous vehicles.

Many risk-aware path planners have been developed to explicitly limit the probability of collision to an acceptable bound in uncertain environments. However, convex obstacles or Gaussian uncertainties are usually assumed to make the problem tractable in the existing method. These assumptions limit the generalization and application of path planners in real-world implementations. In this article, we propose to apply deep learning methods to the sampling-based planner, developing a novel risk bounded near-optimal path planning algorithm named neural risk-aware RRT (NR-RRT). Specifically, a deterministic risk contours map is maintained by perceiving the probabilistic nonconvex obstacles, and a neural network sampler is proposed to predict the next most-promising safe state. Furthermore, the recursive divide-and-conquer planning and bidirectional search strategies are used to accelerate the convergence to a near-optimal solution with guaranteed bounded risk. Worst-case theoretical guarantees can also be proven owing to a standby safety guaranteed planner utilizing a uniform sampling distribution.

We introduce a framework for aggressive quadrotor trajectory generation with global reasoning capabilities that combines the best of trajectory optimization and discrete graph search. Specifically, we develop a novel algorithmic framework that interleaves these two methods to complement each other and generate trajectories with provable guarantees on completeness up to discretization.

To address this problem, most existing algorithms are based on supervised learning methods to learn an automatic photo enhancer for paired data, which consists of low-quality photos and corresponding expert-retouched versions. However, the style and characteristics of photos retouched by experts may not meet the needs or preferences of general users. In this paper, we present an unsupervised image enhancement generative adversarial network (UEGAN), which learns the corresponding image-to-image mapping from a set of images with desired characteristics in an unsupervised manner, rather than learning on a large number of paired images. The proposed model is based on single deep GAN which embeds the modulation and attention mechanisms to capture richer global and local features.

Fiber bundles essentially describe lower-dimensional projections of the state space using local product spaces.

In many emergency situations, precise navigation between obstacles and time-efficient searching around 3D structures is essential for finding survivors. In this work we propose an integrated assessment and search planning approach which allows an autonomous UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) agent to plan and execute collision-free search trajectories in 3D environments. More specifically, the proposed search-planning framework aims to integrate and automate the first two phases (i.e., the assessment phase and the search phase) of a traditional search-and-rescue (SAR) mission. In the first stage, termed assessment-planning we aim to find a high-level assessment plan which the UAV agent can execute in order to visit a set of points of interest.

The main contribution of the paper is twofold. The first contribution is the description of a method for utilizing existing cell-decomposition methods to enumerate and represent local trajectory generation problems that can be solved efficiently and independently. In addition, a relationship between the proposed cell-sequence representation and homotopy classes is analyzed. The second contribution is a computationally efficient novel formulation of the trajectory optimization problem within a cell sequence via mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP).

Often, UAVs on these missions must first build a map of the environment via pure exploration and subsequently use (i.e. exploit) the generated map for downstream navigation tasks. Accomplishing these navigation tasks in two separate steps is not always possible and can potentially be disadvantageous for UAVs deployed in outdoor and dynamically changing environments. Current exploration approaches typically use a priori human-generated maps or heuristics such as frontier-based exploration. Other approaches use learning but focus only on learning policies for specific tasks and use sample inefficient random exploration or make impractical assumptions about full map availability. In this paper, we develop an adaptive exploration approach that allows for a trade off between exploration and exploitation in a single step using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We specifically focus on UAVs searching for areas of interest (AoIs) in an unknown environment. The proposed approach uses a map segmentation technique to decompose the environment map into smaller, tractable maps. DDQN and A2C algorithms are extended with a stack of LSTM layers and trained to generate optimal policies for the exploration and exploitation tasks, respectively. Then, an information gain function is repeatedly computed to determine the optimal trade-off between them. We tested our approach in 3 different tasks against 4 baselines. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of navigating through randomly generated environments and covering more AoI in less time compared to the baselines.},\n  eventtitle = {2021 {{International Conference}} on {{Unmanned Aircraft Systems}} ({{ICUAS}})},\n  keywords = {Aircraft,Aircraft navigation,Complexity theory,Drones,Neural networks,Reinforcement learning,Task analysis},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/VE4WHAJP/Peake et al. - 2021 - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Explorati.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/CH8PSCS7/9476756.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764332,"version":0},"$loki":2669},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":251,"entry":"@inproceedings{petrlikLIDARbasedStabilizationNavigation2021,\n  title = {{{LIDAR-based Stabilization}}, {{Navigation}} and {{Localization}} for {{UAVs Operating}} in {{Dark Indoor Environments}}},\n  booktitle = {2021 {{International Conference}} on {{Unmanned Aircraft Systems}} ({{ICUAS}})},\n  author = {Petrl√≠k, Matƒõj and Krajn√≠k, Tom√°≈° and Saska, Martin},\n  date = {2021-06},\n  pages = {243--251},\n  issn = {2575-7296},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476837},\n  abstract = {Autonomous operation of UAVs in a closed environment requires precise and reliable pose estimate that can stabilize the UAV without using external localization systems such as GNSS.

The proposed planner is based on the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm. Artificial potential fields are combined with the RRT* algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed to a suboptimal solution by biasing the random state generation. The performance of this framework is demonstrated on a complex missile application in a heterogeneous environment. Indeed, since the air density decreases exponentially with altitude, the maneuverability of the aerial vehicle depending on aerodynamic forces also decreases exponentially with altitude. To face this problem, the shortest paths of Dubins-like vehicles traveling in a heterogeneous environment are used to build the metric. In the simulation results, this framework can find the first solution with fewer iterations than the RRT and the RRT* algorithm.

We pursue a graph search method that, despite the high dimensionality of the problem, the complex dynamics of the system and the continuously changing environment model is capable of generating dynamically feasible motions in real-time. This is enabled by leveraging the differential flatness property of the system and by developing a structured search space based on state lattice motion primitives.

The process samples the reachability of the system and reduces it to a set of representative, canonical motions that are compatible with the state lattice structure, which guarantees that any incremental replanning algorithm is able to produce smooth dynamically feasible motion plans while reusing previous computation between replans.

Our approach thereby extracts additional homological information which is essential for a topological trajectory classification. We propose a multiscale classification algorithm for trajectories in configuration spaces of arbitrary dimension and for sets of trajectories starting and ending in two fixed points. Using a cone construction, we then generalize this approach to classify sets of trajectories even when trajectory start and end points are allowed to vary in path-connected subsets.

One challenge is that demonstrated trajectories may vary dramatically: it can be very difficult, if not impossible, for a system to learn control policies unless the trajectories are clustered into meaningful consistent subsets. Metric clustering methods, based on a distance measure, require quadratic time to compute a pairwise distance matrix and do not naturally distinguish topologically distinct trajectories. This paper presents an algorithm for topological clustering based on relative persistent homology, which, for a fixed underlying simplicial representation and discretization of trajectories, requires only linear time in the number of trajectories. The algorithm incorporates global constraints formalized in terms of the topology of sublevel or superlevel sets of a function and can be extended to incorporate probabilistic motion models. In experiments with real automobile and ship GPS trajectories as well as pedestrian trajectories extracted from video, the algorithm clusters trajectories into meaningful consistent subsets and, as we show in an experiment with ship trajectories, results in a faster and more efficient clustering than a metric clustering by Fr√©chet distance.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Robotics}} and {{Automation}} ({{ICRA}})},\n  keywords = {Clustering algorithms,Global Positioning System,Measurement,Probabilistic logic,Robots,Topology,Trajectory},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/IQL6ZSYU/Pokorny et al. - 2016 - Topological trajectory clustering with relative pe.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/IB6JVLHK/7487092.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764349,"version":0},"$loki":2679},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1524,"entry":"@misc{qinFFANetFeatureFusion2019,\n  title = {{{FFA-Net}}: {{Feature Fusion Attention Network}} for {{Single Image Dehazing}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{FFA-Net}}},\n  author = {Qin, Xu and Wang, Zhilin and Bai, Yuanchao and Xie, Xiaodong and Jia, Huizhu},\n  date = {2019-12-05},\n  number = {arXiv:1911.07559},\n  eprint = {1911.07559},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  primaryclass = {cs},\n  publisher = {{arXiv}},\n  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1911.07559},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07559},\n  urldate = {2022-10-14},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an end-to-end feature fusion at-tention network (FFA-Net) to directly restore the haze-free image.

FA treats different features and pixels unequally, which provides additional flexibility in dealing with different types of information, expanding the representational ability of CNNs. 2) A basic block structure consists of Local Residual Learning and Feature Attention, Local Residual Learning allowing the less important information such as thin haze region or low-frequency to be bypassed through multiple local residual connections, let main network architecture focus on more effective information. 3) An Attention-based different levels Feature Fusion (FFA) structure, the feature weights are adaptively learned from the Feature Attention (FA) module, giving more weight to important features. This structure can also retain the information of shallow layers and pass it into deep layers. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FFA-Net surpasses previous state-of-the-art single image dehazing methods by a very large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, boosting the best published PSNR metric from 30.23db to 36.39db on the SOTS indoor test dataset.

Many path planning algorithms generate a path which has many sharp or angular turns. Such paths are not fit for mobile robot as it has to slow down at these sharp turns. These robots could be carrying delicate, dangerous, or precious items and executing these sharp turns may not be feasible kinematically. On the contrary, smooth trajectories are often desired for robot motion and must be generated while considering the static and dynamic obstacles and other constraints like feasible curvature, robot and lane dimensions, and speed. The aim of this paper is to succinctly summarize and review the path smoothing techniques in robot navigation and discuss the challenges and future trends. Both autonomous mobile robots and autonomous vehicles (outdoor robots or self-driving cars) are discussed. The state-of-the-art algorithms are broadly classified into different categories and each approach is introduced briefly with necessary background, merits, and drawbacks.

With recent technological advancements, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has proliferated. Autonomous UAV navigation is an example of an application in which AI plays a critical role in providing fundamental human control characteristics.

We also present a technique for automatically selecting the amount of time allocated to each segment, and hence the quadrotor speeds along the path, as a function of a single parameter determining aggressiveness, subject to actuator constraints. The use of polynomial trajectories, coupled with the differentially flat representation of the quadrotor, eliminates the need for computationally intensive sampling and simulation in the high dimensional state space of the vehicle during motion planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based optimal kinodynamic planning methods, but sacrifices the guarantee of asymptotic convergence to the global optimum that those methods provide.

A lot of research has been devoted to improve object detection algorithms in order to provide highly accurate detection results in real time. However, these algorithms show a strong drop in performance as soon as they are exposed to adverse weather. Poor weather conditions such as rain, fog or snow lead to a reduction in visibility and thus objects are more difficult to recognize or not visible at all. This leads to a high degree of uncertainty for an automotive camera system. To enable automated driving, camera systems must be able to cope with adverse weather and the associated high uncertainty. Including more weather image data when training the algorithms can improve object detection in bad visibility conditions. However, weather image data is difficult to collect in reality and thus only available to a limited extent. In this work, we evaluate the possibility of using Generative Adversarial Networks to create synthetic weather image data.

It allows one to dispense with the intervention of human operators, which may prove beneficial in economic and safety terms. Autonomy requires, in most cases, the use of path planners that enable the robot to deliberate about how to move from its location at one moment to another. Looking for the most appropriate path planning algorithm according to the requirements imposed by users can be challenging, given the overwhelming number of approaches that exist in the literature. Moreover, the past review works analyzed here cover only some of these approaches, missing important ones. For this reason, our paper aims to serve as a starting point for a clear and comprehensive overview of the research to date. It introduces a global classification of path planning algorithms, with a focus on those approaches used along with autonomous ground vehicles, but is also extendable to other robots moving on surfaces, such as autonomous boats. Moreover, the models used to represent the environment, together with the robot mobility and dynamics, are also addressed from the perspective of path planning. Each of the path planning categories presented in the classification is disclosed and analyzed, and a discussion about their applicability is added at the end.},\n  issue = {23},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {üëÅÔ∏è,üìö,üî•,autonomy,graph search,guidance,route,sampling,survey,trajectory,vehicle,wheeled},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WINATDC8/S√°nchez-Ib√°√±ez et al. - 2021 - Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots A Revi.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/RH8DYKF5/7898.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764394,"version":0},"$loki":2704},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":221,"entry":"@inproceedings{sannaNeuralNetworkBased2021,\n  title = {Neural {{Network Based Algorithm}} for {{Multi-UAV Coverage Path Planning}}},\n  booktitle = {2021 {{International Conference}} on {{Unmanned Aircraft Systems}} ({{ICUAS}})},\n  author = {Sanna, Giovanni and Godio, Simone and Guglieri, Giorgio},\n  date = {2021-06},\n  pages = {1210--1217},\n  issn = {2575-7296},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476864},\n  abstract = {This paper proposes a method to tackle the Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem for a fleet of AI-driven UAVs while accounting for congestion, collision avoidance, and efficiency of the path.

The neural network creates a correlation between the current state of a UAV and the best action to take at each time step. The exploration strategy is stored in a labeled database for the single-UAV case; the neural network learns and replicates it in the multi-UAV case, being able to generalize the acquired skills over new maps not contained in the database. The training session imitates human priors in a multi-class classification, which completely bypasses common drawbacks such as the need for large databases or high computational resources.

Those two components are totally decoupled and can run independently of each other. This makes our simulator extremely fast: rendering achieves speeds of up to 230 Hz, while physics simulation of up to 200,000 Hz on a laptop. In addition, Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) integration with a virtual-reality headset for interaction with the simulated environment.

There are three main challenges for MAV state estimation: (1) it can deal with aggressive 6 DOF (Degree Of Freedom) motion; (2) it should be robust to intermittent GPS (Global Positioning System) (even GPS-denied) situations; (3) it should work well both for low- and high-altitude flight. In this paper, we present a state estimation technique by fusing long-range stereo visual odometry, GPS, barometric and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurements. The new estimation system has two main parts, a stochastic cloning EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) estimator that loosely fuses both absolute state measurements (GPS, barometer) and the relative state measurements (IMU, visual odometry), and is derived and discussed in detail. A long-range stereo visual odometry is proposed for high-altitude MAV odometry calculation by using both multi-view stereo triangulation and a multi-view stereo inverse depth filter. The odometry takes the EKF information (IMU integral) for robust camera pose tracking and image feature matching, and the stereo odometry output serves as the relative measurements for the update of the state estimation. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset and our real flight dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation system, especially for the aggressive, intermittent GPS and high-altitude MAV flight.},\n  issue = {1},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {absolute and relative state measurements,GPS-denied state estimation,long-range stereo visual odometry,multi-sensor fusion,stochastic cloning EKF},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/EIWCH2PT/Song et al. - 2017 - A Multi-Sensor Fusion MAV State Estimation from Lo.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8HHGY65C/htm.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764541,"version":0},"$loki":2729},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":537,"entry":"@article{songNewGeneticAlgorithm2016,\n  title = {A New Genetic Algorithm Approach to Smooth Path Planning for Mobile Robots},\n  author = {Song, Baoye and Wang, Zidong and Sheng, Li},\n  date = {2016-01-01},\n  journaltitle = {Assembly Automation},\n  volume = {36},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {138--145},\n  publisher = {{Emerald Group Publishing Limited}},\n  issn = {0144-5154},\n  doi = {10.1108/AA-11-2015-094},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1108/AA-11-2015-094},\n  urldate = {2022-05-23},\n  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to consider the smooth path planning problem for a mobile robot based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and the Bezier curve. Design/methodology/approach The workspace of a mobile robot is described by a new grid-based representation that facilitates the operations of the adopted GA. The chromosome of the GA is composed of a sequence of binary numbered grids (i.e. control points of the Bezier curve). Ordinary genetic operators including crossover and mutation are used to search the optimum chromosome where the optimization criterion is the length of a piecewise collision-free Bezier curve path determined by the control points. Findings This paper has proposed a new smooth path planning for a mobile robot by resorting to the GA and the Bezier curve. A new grid-based representation of the workspace has been presented, which makes it convenient to perform operations in the GA. The GA has been used to search the optimum control points that determine the Bezier curve-based smooth path. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified by a numerical experiment, and some performances of the obtained method have also been analyzed. Research limitations/implications There still remain many interesting topics, for example, how to solve the specific smooth path planning problem by using the GA and how to promote the computational efficiency in the more grids case. These issues deserve further research. Originality/value The purpose of this paper is to improve the existing results by making the following three distinctive contributions: a rigorous mathematical formulation of the path planning optimization problem is formulated; a general grid-based representation (2n √ó 2n) is proposed to describe the workspace of the mobile robots to facilitate the implementation of the GA where n is chosen according to the trade-off between the accuracy and the computational burden; and the control points of the Bezier curve are directly linked to the optimization criteria so that the generated paths are guaranteed to be optimal without any need for smoothing afterwards.},\n  keywords = {Genetic algorithms,Robotics},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/AMHY4N8W/Song et al. - 2016 - A new genetic algorithm approach to smooth path pl.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764544,"version":0},"$loki":2730},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1087,"entry":"@inproceedings{souissiPathPlanning20132013,\n  title = {Path Planning: {{A}} 2013 Survey},\n  shorttitle = {Path Planning},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of 2013 {{International Conference}} on {{Industrial Engineering}} and {{Systems Management}} ({{IESM}})},\n  author = {Souissi, Omar and Benatitallah, Rabie and Duvivier, David and Artiba, AbedlHakim and Belanger, Nicolas and Feyzeau, Pierre},\n  date = {2013-10},\n  pages = {1--8},\n  abstract = {In the recent decades an impressive progress was done in automation and robotic fields.

Algorithms exist for handling a variety of robot shapes, configurations, motion constraints, and environments. Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of unknown or partially-known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan (indoor) or terrain map (outdoor). Existing approaches plan an initial global path or route based on known information and then modify the plan locally as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors.While this strategy works well in environments with small, sparse obstacles, it can lead to grossly suboptimal and incomplete results in cluttered spaces. An alternative approach is to replan the global path from scratch each time a new obstacle is discovered. While this approach is optimal, it is grossly inefficient and can require a high-performance computer for real-time operation. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner. D* models the environment as a graph, where each node represents a robot state (e.g., a location in a room), and each arc represents the cost (e.g., distance to travel) of moving between two states. Initially, a path is planned from the goal to the robot's location using known information. As the robot moves, its sensors discover obstacles in its path. These discoveries are handled by modifying the arc costs. D* propagates information minimally about these arc changes in the graph ...},\n  keywords = {üëÅÔ∏è},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JIJ3DCAQ/Stentz - 1993 - Optimal and Efficient Path Planning for Unknown an.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XH8KPQCX/summary.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764549,"version":0},"$loki":2733},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":668,"entry":"@book{strangIntroductionLinearAlgebra2016,\n  title = {Introduction to Linear Algebra},\n  author = {Strang, Gilbert},\n  date = {2016},\n  edition = {5th edition},\n  publisher = {{Cambridge press}},\n  location = {{Wellesley}},\n  isbn = {978-0-9802327-7-6},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/RBWQVFQL/Strang - 2016 - Introduction to linear algebra.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764550,"version":0},"$loki":2734},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1008,"entry":"@misc{sturtevantHeuristicSearchComes2012,\n  title = {Heuristic {{Search Comes}} of {{Age}}},\n  author = {Sturtevant, Nathan R. and Felner, Ariel and Likhachev, Maxim and Ruml, Wheeler},\n  date = {2012},\n  abstract = {In looking back on the last five to ten years of work in heuristic search a few trends emerge.

Adaptive A * is a recent incremental heuristic search algorithm that solves series of similar search problems faster than A * because it updates the h-values using information from previous searches. It basically transforms consistent h-values into more informed consistent h-values. This allows it to find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase over time since consistent h-values remain consistent after action cost increases. However, it is not guaranteed to find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can decrease over time because consistent h-values do not necessarily remain consistent after action cost decreases. Thus, the h-values need to get corrected after action cost decreases. In this paper, we show how to do that, resulting in Generalized Adaptive A* (GAA*) that finds shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase or decrease over time.

Unlike previous samplingbased approaches in robotics which use graphs to capture information about the path-connectedness of a configuration space, we construct a multiscale approximation of neighborhoods of the collision free configurations based on filtrations of simplicial complexes. Our approach thereby extracts additional homological information which is essential for a topological trajectory classification. By computing a basis for the first persistent homology groups, we obtain a multiscale classification algorithm for trajectories in configuration spaces of arbitrary dimension.

The main goal of these algorithms is to find the shortest and smooth path between the starting and target points. This paper makes use of a B√©zier curve-based model for path planning. The control points of the B√©zier curve significantly influence the length and smoothness of the path. In this paper, a novel Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) algorithm has been proposed to optimize the control points of B√©zier curve, and the proposed algorithm comes in two variants: CPSO-I and CPSO-II. Using the chosen control points, the optimum smooth path that minimizes the total distance between the starting and ending points is selected. To evaluate the CPSO algorithm, the results of the CPSO-I and CPSO-II algorithms are compared with the standard PSO algorithm. The experimental results proved that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding the optimal path. Moreover, the CPSO algorithm was tested against different numbers of control points and obstacles, and the CPSO algorithm achieved competitive results.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {B√©zier curve,Chaos,Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),Path planning},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HF439VPR/Tharwat et al. - 2019 - Intelligent B√©zier curve-based path planning model.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764569,"version":0},"$loki":2745},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":679,"entry":"@inproceedings{tordesillasFASTERFastSafe2019,\n  title = {{{FASTER}}: {{Fast}} and {{Safe Trajectory Planner}} for {{Flights}} in {{Unknown Environments}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{FASTER}}},\n  booktitle = {2019 {{IEEE}}/{{RSJ International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Robots}} and {{Systems}} ({{IROS}})},\n  author = {Tordesillas, Jesus and Lopez, Brett T. and How, Jonathan P.},\n  date = {2019-11},\n  pages = {1934--1940},\n  issn = {2153-0866},\n  doi = {10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968021},\n  abstract = {High-speed trajectory planning through unknown environments requires algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times while maintaining safety as new information about the operating environment is obtained. The requirement of computational tractability typically leads to optimization problems that do not include the obstacle constraints (collision checks are done on the solutions) or use a convex decomposition of the free space and then impose an ad-hoc time allocation scheme for each interval of the trajectory. Moreover, safety guarantees are usually obtained by having a local planner that plans a trajectory with a final ‚Äústop‚Äù condition in the freeknown space. However, these two decisions typically lead to slow and conservative trajectories. We propose FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to overcome these issues.

PANTHER plans trajectories that avoid dynamic obstacles while also keeping them in the sensor field of view (FOV) and minimizing the blur to aid in object tracking. The rotation and translation of the UAV are jointly optimized, which allows PANTHER to fully exploit the differential flatness of multirotors to maximize the PA objective. Real-time performance is achieved by implicitly imposing the underactuated dynamics of the UAV through the Hopf fibration. PANTHER is able to keep the obstacles inside the FOV 7.9 and 1.5 times more than non-PA approaches and PA approaches that decouple translation and yaw, respectively. The projected velocity (and hence the blur) is reduced by 18\\% and 34\\%, respectively. This leads to average success rates three times larger than state-of-the-art approaches in multi-obstacle avoidance scenarios. The MINVO basis is used to impose low-conservative collision avoidance constraints in position and velocity space.

UAVs with this capability have begun to emerge in the literature with advances in lightweight sensing and computing. Although the planning methodologies vary from platform to platform, many algorithms adopt a hierarchical planning architecture where a slow, low-fidelity global planner guides a fast, high-fidelity local planner. However, in unknown environments, this approach can lead to erratic or unstable behavior due to the interaction between the global planner, whose solution is changing constantly, and the local planner; a consequence of not capturing higher-order dynamics in the global plan. This work proposes a planning framework in which multi-fidelity models are used to reduce the discrepancy between the local and global planner. Our approach uses high-, medium-, and low-fidelity models to compose a path that captures higher-order dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. In addition, we address the interaction between a fast planner and a slower mapper by considering the sensor data not yet fused into the map during the collision check.

Most methods proposed in the literature have been designed to deal with just removing one type of degradation. Recently, a CNN-based method using neural architecture search (All-in-One) was proposed to remove all the weather conditions at once. However, it has a large number of parameters as it uses multiple encoders to cater to each weather removal task and still has scope for improvement in its performance. In this work, we focus on developing an efficient solution for the all adverse weather removal problem. To this end, we propose TransWeather, a transformer-based end-to-end model with just a single encoder and a decoder that can restore an image degraded by any weather condition. Specifically, we utilize a novel transformer encoder using intra-patch transformer blocks to enhance attention inside the patches to effectively remove smaller weather degradations. We also introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather type embeddings to adjust to the weather degradation at hand. TransWeather achieves significant improvements across multiple test datasets over both All-in-One network as well as methods fine-tuned for specific tasks. In particular, TransWeather pushes the current state-of-the-art by +6.34 PSNR on the Test1 (rain+fog) dataset, +4.93 PSNR on the SnowTest100K-L dataset and +3.11 PSNR on the RainDrop test dataset.

The basic idea behind the proposal relies on the construction of a nonlinear equation representing the map of the environment, making it possible to apply HCM methods to obtain collision-free paths. A series of simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the method avoiding circular, semi-rectangular, spherical shaped and semi-parallelepipeds obstacles.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Homotopy continuation method,Path planning,Robot navigation},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/LJSSFSKH/Vazquez-Leal et al. - 2013 - Exploring collision-free path planning by using ho.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/KXQYLI73/S0096300313000775.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764595,"version":0},"$loki":2759},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":901,"entry":"@inproceedings{vega-brownAdmissibleAbstractionsNearoptimal2018,\n  title = {Admissible {{Abstractions}} for {{Near-optimal Task}} and {{Motion Planning}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the {{Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference}} on {{Artificial Intelligence}}},\n  author = {Vega-Brown, William and Roy, Nicholas},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {4852--4859},\n  publisher = {{International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization}},\n  location = {{Stockholm, Sweden}},\n  doi = {10.24963/ijcai.2018/674},\n  url = {https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/674},\n  urldate = {2022-06-27},\n  abstract = {We define an admissibility condition for abstractions expressed using angelic semantics and show that these conditions allow us to accelerate planning while preserving the ability to find the optimal motion plan.

In approaches that ignore the time dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is unavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally sub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness, it is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of adaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion planning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the context of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the idea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic environments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model. Specifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions of the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a low-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete and is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost sub-optimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of 3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show that the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over 4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates significantly from the one suggested by the heuristic.},\n  issue = {1},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {üëÅÔ∏è,Adaptive Dimensionality,Dynamic Environments,Path Planning},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2W8GHKV9/Vemula et al. - 2016 - Path Planning in Dynamic Environments with Adaptiv.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764603,"version":0},"$loki":2761},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1473,"entry":"@inproceedings{vossHeuristicApproachFinding2015,\n  title = {A Heuristic Approach to Finding Diverse Short Paths},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Robotics}} and {{Automation}} ({{ICRA}})},\n  author = {Voss, Caleb and Moll, Mark and Kavraki, Lydia E.},\n  date = {2015-05},\n  pages = {4173--4179},\n  issn = {1050-4729},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139774},\n  abstract = {We present an algorithm that seeks to find a set of diverse, short paths through a roadmap graph.

The ideal flight path is expected to balance the total flight path length and the terrain threat, to shorten the flight time and reduce the possibility of collision. However, in the traditional methods, the tradeoff between these concerns is difficult to achieve, and practical constraints are lacking in the optimized objective functions, which leads to inaccurate modeling. In addition, the traditional methods based on gradient optimization lack an accurate optimization capability in the complex multimodal objective space, resulting in a nonoptimal path. Thus, in this article, an accurate UAV 3-D path planning approach in accordance with an enhanced multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed (APPMS). In the APPMS method, the path planning mission is converted into a multiobjective optimization task with multiple constraints, and the objectives based on the total flight path length and degree of terrain threat are simultaneously optimized. In addition, to obtain the optimal UAV 3-D flight path, an accurate swarm intelligence search approach based on improved ant colony optimization is introduced, which can improve the global and local search capabilities by using the preferred search direction and random neighborhood search mechanism.

The key insight that allows us to solve this problem is to stochastically distribute the robots across different routes in the environment by assigning them paths in different topologically distinct classes, so as to lower congestion and the overall travel time for all robots in the environment. We outline the computation of topologically distinct paths in a spatio-temporal configuration space and propose methods for the stochastic assignment of paths to the robots.

In this article, we address the problem of autonomous UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments by formulating it as a Markov decision process with sparse rewards and propose an algorithm named deep reinforcement learning (RL) with nonexpert helpers (LwH). In contrast to prior RL-based methods that put huge efforts into reward shaping, we adopt the sparse reward scheme, i.e., a UAV will be rewarded if and only if it completes navigation tasks. Using the sparse reward scheme ensures that the solution is not biased toward potentially suboptimal directions. However, having no intermediate rewards hinders the agent from efficient learning since informative states are rarely encountered. To handle the challenge, we assume that a prior policy (nonexpert helper) that might be of poor performance is available to the learning agent. The prior policy plays the role of guiding the agent in exploring the state space by reshaping the behavior policy used for environmental interaction. It also assists the agent in achieving goals by setting dynamic learning objectives with increasing difficulty. To evaluate our proposed method, we construct a simulator for UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments and compare our algorithm with several baselines.

The fundamental problem which limits clear image reconstruction is the random diffusion of light in the scattering medium. Recently, the dark channel prior method has emerged as a powerful approach for haze removal under adverse weather conditions. However, this method requires high computational time, and fails to achieve haze-free image in the sky region. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel imaging method based on quadtree theory combined with transmission optimization (QTCTO) to restore the visibility of images degraded by scattering medium. The proposed method uses the quadtree theory (for region segmentation) to estimate the global atmospheric light, while the transmission in the media is estimated by coefficient modification for the dark channel. The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against scattering (under smoke and turbid water conditions) and has the advantage of low computational time.

Smooth maps are utilized to exactly eliminate geometrical constraints in a lightweight fashion. A variety of state-input constraints are supported by the decoupling of dense constraint evaluation from sparse parameterization and the backward differentiation of flatness map. As a result, this framework transforms a generally constrained multicopter planning problem into an unconstrained optimization that can be solved reliably and efficiently. Our framework bridges the gaps among solution quality, planning efficiency, and constraint fidelity for a multicopter with limited resources and maneuvering capability. Its generality and robustness are both demonstrated by applications to different flight tasks.

However, they suffer sensitivity to the initial solution and slow convergence to the optimal solution, which means that they consume a lot of memory and time to find the optimal path. It is critical to quickly find a short path in many applications such as the autonomous vehicle with limited power/fuel. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel optimal path planning algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), namely the neural RRT* (NRRT*). The NRRT* utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution generated from a CNN model. The model is trained using quantities of successful path planning cases. In this article, we use the A* algorithm to generate the training data set consisting of the map information and the optimal path. For a given task, the proposed CNN model can predict the probability distribution of the optimal path on the map, which is used to guide the sampling process. The time cost and memory usage of the planned path are selected as the metric to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the NRRT*. The simulation results reveal that the NRRT* can achieve convincing performance compared with the state-of-the-art path planning algorithms. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this article stems from the need to develop a fast and efficient path planning algorithm for practical applications such as autonomous driving, warehouse robot, and countless others. Sampling-based algorithms are widely used in these areas due to their good scalability and high efficiency. However, the quality of the initial path is not guaranteed and it takes much time to converge to the optimal path. To quickly obtain a high-quality initial path and accelerate the convergence speed, we propose the NRRT*. It utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution and achieves better performance.

While recent CNN-based derainers have reported promising performances, deraining remains an open problem for two reasons. First, existing synthesized rain datasets have only limited realism, in terms of modeling real rain characteristics such as rain shape, direction and intensity. Second, there are no public benchmarks for quantitative comparisons on real rain images, which makes the current evaluation less objective. The core challenge is that real world rain/clean image pairs cannot be captured at the same time. In this paper, we address the single image rain removal problem in two ways. First, we propose a semi-automatic method that incorporates temporal priors and human supervision to generate a high-quality clean image from each input sequence of real rain images. Using this method, we construct a large-scale dataset of ‚àº29.5K rain/rain-free image pairs that covers a wide range of natural rain scenes. Second, to better cover the stochastic distribution of real rain streaks, we propose a novel SPatial Attentive Network (SPANet) to remove rain streaks in a local-to-global manner.

One reason is that second-order optimality requires calculating Hessian matrices that can grow with O(N2) with the number of waypoints. Decreasing the waypoints can quadratically decrease computation time. Unfortunately, fewer waypoints result in lower quality trajectories that may not avoid the collision. To have both, dense waypoints and reduced computation time, we took inspiration from recent studies on consensus optimization and propose a distributed formulation of collocated trajectory optimization. It breaks a long trajectory into several segments, where each segment becomes a subproblem of a few waypoints. These subproblems are solved classically, but in parallel, and the solutions are fused into a single trajectory with a consensus constraint that enforces continuity of the segments through a consensus update. With this scheme, the quadratic complexity is distributed to each segment and enables solving for higher-quality trajectories with denser waypoints. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is amenable to using any existing trajectory optimizer for solving the subproblems.

In particular, we are interested in solving this problem without relying on localization, mapping, or planning techniques. Most of the existing work consider obstacle avoidance as two separate problems, namely obstacle detection, and control. Inspired by the recent advantages of deep reinforcement learning in Atari games and understanding highly complex situations in Go, we tackle the obstacle avoidance problem as a data-driven end-to-end deep learning approach.

Imagine, for example, a complicated building like an airport, where passengers can consult a computer terminal to get navigation advices to a desired goal. By scanning the boarding card the calculation of alternatives can be made context-sensitive. Based on gender, amount of time, or shopping preferences, for example, the terminal can display different routes regarding floors traversed, or shops and restaurants passed. Furthermore, the building operator can control the presentation of alternatives in order to influence visitor flows in real time. Therefore, we propose to use the topological concept of homotopy in order to decide if two routes should be considered equivalent or alternative. Basically, the homotopy relation identifies equivalence classes. We propose that a representative of an equivalence class is an alternative regarding another equivalence class. We concatenate the two routes in question and thus, create a polygon. If there is an obstacle inside, the routes are non-homotopic and we consider them as proper alternatives. For this situation, we propose two fundamentally different approaches that are able to find alternative routes with respect to homotopy. The input is a building plan in form of an occupancy grid. Bitmaps allow for fast calculation of the homotopy relation and can be generated from almost any type of environmental model. The first approach aims for enumerating routes that have to visit a special supporting point. This concatenation of two shortest paths leads to alternatives very fast. The second approach is orthogonal to that in the sense that it generates alternatives roughly ordered by their length. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the approaches' feasibility based on different metrics in several scenarios.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{International Conference}} on {{Indoor Positioning}} and {{Indoor Navigation}} ({{IPIN}})},\n  keywords = {Buildings,Indoor navigation,Measurement,Roads,Solids},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/IARJHWPV/Werner and Feld - 2014 - Homotopy and alternative routes in indoor navigati.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/A4AE6FW5/7275488.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764654,"version":0},"$loki":2785},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1332,"entry":"@inproceedings{wongPersistentHomologyBased2021,\n  title = {Persistent {{Homology Based Graph Convolution Network}} for {{Fine-Grained 3D Shape Segmentation}}},\n  author = {Wong, Chi-Chong and Vong, Chi-Man},\n  date = {2021},\n  pages = {7098--7107},\n  url = {https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wong_Persistent_Homology_Based_Graph_Convolution_Network_for_Fine-Grained_3D_Shape_ICCV_2021_paper.html},\n  urldate = {2022-08-26},\n  eventtitle = {Proceedings of the {{IEEE}}/{{CVF International Conference}} on {{Computer Vision}}},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/9FU34SU4/Wong and Vong - 2021 - Persistent Homology Based Graph Convolution Networ.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/EE8AGE4Q/Wong_Persistent_Homology_Based_Graph_Convolution_Network_for_Fine-Grained_3D_Shape_ICCV_2021_pa.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764655,"version":0},"$loki":2786},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":203,"entry":"@inproceedings{wuAirgroundCooperativeExploration2021,\n  title = {Air-Ground Cooperative Exploration of {{3D}} Complex Environment with Maximized Visibility and Obstacles Avoidance},\n  booktitle = {2021 {{International Conference}} on {{Unmanned Aircraft Systems}} ({{ICUAS}})},\n  author = {Wu, YuXuan and Wang, Jing and Zhou, Meng and Dong, Zhe and Chen, YangQuan},\n  date = {2021-06},\n  pages = {1416--1421},\n  issn = {2575-7296},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476714},\n  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide vision at high altitude.

Choosing how to prioritize the robots is a key consideration. State-of-the-art prioritization heuristics, however, do not model the coupling between a robot's mobility and its environment. This is particularly relevant when prioritizing between robots with different degrees of mobility. In this paper, we propose a prioritization rule that can be computed online by each robot independently, and that provides consistent, conflict-free path plans. Our innovation is to formalize a robot's path prospects to reach its goal from its current location. To this end, we consider the number of homology classes of trajectories, which capture distinct prospects of paths for each robot. This measure is used as a prioritization rule, whenever any robots enter negotiation to deconflict path plans. We perform simulations with heterogeneous robot teams and compare our method to five benchmarks.

Experimental results show that the heuristic function significantly affects the computing performance and the final path of path planning algorithms, and Manhattan distance is the most efficiency heuristic function for all the four path planning algorithms. We apply A*, D*, LPA* and D* Lite algorithms to static and dynamic environments, respectively with different map size and complexity.

We create a model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation iteratively and progressively.

Motivated by accelerating the inefficient exploration of the homotopy-augmented space of the 2D environment, our fundamental idea is to identify the non-\\$k\\$-optimal path topologies as early as possible and terminate the pathfinding along them. This is a non-trivial practice because it has to be done at an intermediate state of the path planning process when locally shortest paths have not been fully constructed. In other words, the paths to be compared have not rendezvoused at the goal location, which makes the homotopy theory, modelling the spatial relationship among the paths having the same endpoint, not applicable. This paper is the first work that develops a systematic distance-based topology simplification mechanism to solve the \\$k\\$-SNPP task, whose core contribution is to assert the distance-based order of non-homotopic locally shortest paths before constructing them. If the order can be predicted, then those path topologies having more than \\$k\\$ better topologies are proven free of the desired \\$k\\$ paths and thus can be safely discarded during the path planning process. To this end, a hierarchical topological tree is proposed as an implementation of the mechanism, whose nodes are proven to expand in non-homotopic directions and edges (collision-free path segments) are proven locally shortest. With efficient criteria that observe the order relations between partly constructed locally shortest paths being imparted into the tree, the tree nodes that expand in non-\\$k\\$-optimal topologies will not be expanded. As a result, the computational time for solving the \\$k\\$-SNPP problem is reduced by near two orders of magnitude.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords = {üëÅÔ∏è,Computer Science - Robotics},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HTCLP5QM/Yang et al. - 2022 - Efficient Search of the k Shortest Non-Homotopic P.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2XRGL2NM/2207.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764670,"version":0},"$loki":2793},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":789,"entry":"@article{yangLearningSpacePartitions,\n  title = {Learning {{Space Partitions}} for {{Path Planning}}},\n  author = {Yang, Kevin and Zhang, Tianjun and Cummins, Chris and Cui, Brandon and Steiner, Benoit and Wang, Linnan and Gonzalez, Joseph E and Klein, Dan and Tian, Yuandong},\n  pages = {14},\n  abstract = {Path planning, the problem of efficiently discovering high-reward trajectories, often requires optimizing a high-dimensional and multimodal reward function.

DOO [31] and VOOT [22] balance exploration and exploitation, but use space partitioning strategies independent of the reward function to be optimized. Recently, LaMCTS [45] empirically learns to partition the search space in a reward-sensitive manner for black-box optimization. In this paper, we develop a novel formal regret analysis for when and why such an adaptive region partitioning scheme works. We also propose a new path planning method LaP3 which improves the function value estimation within each sub-region, and uses a latent representation of the search space. Empirically, LaP3 outperforms existing path planning methods in 2D navigation tasks, especially in the presence of difficult-to-escape local optima, and shows benefits when plugged into the planning components of model-based RL such as PETS [7].

However, these methods are limited in the sense that they can be trained only on fully labeled data. Due to various challenges in obtaining real world fully-labeled image deraining datasets, existing methods are trained only on synthetically generated data and hence, generalize poorly to real-world images. The use of real-world data in training image deraining networks is relatively less explored in the literature. We propose a Gaussian Process-based semi-supervised learning framework which enables the network in learning to derain using synthetic dataset while generalizing better using unlabeled real-world images. Through extensive experiments and ablations on several challenging datasets (such as Rain800, Rain200H and DDN-SIRR), we show that the proposed method, when trained on limited labeled data, achieves on-par performance with fully-labeled training. Additionally, we demonstrate that using unlabeled real-world images in the proposed GP-based framework results in superior performance as compared to existing methods.

In this paper we present an approach to solving this problem by combining the global and local path planning problem into a single search using a combined 2-D and higher dimensional state-space.},\n  eventtitle = {2012 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Robotics}} and {{Automation}}},\n  keywords = {Oscillators,Planning,Robot sensing systems,Trajectory,Turning},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/AYUVZUJX/Zhang et al. - 2012 - Combining global and local planning with guarantee.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SR6QFTG2/6225382.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764699,"version":0},"$loki":2809},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1486,"entry":"@article{zhangDataDrivenSingleImage,\n  title = {Data-{{Driven Single Image Deraining}}: {{A Comprehensive Review}} and {{New Perspectives}}},\n  author = {Zhang, Zhao and Yan, Shuicheng and Wang, Meng},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE},\n  pages = {20},\n  abstract = {Due to the powerful fitting ability of neural networks and massive training data, data-driven Single Image Deraining (SID) methods have obtained significant performance, and most of existing studies focus on improving the performance by proposing different deraining networks. However, the generalization ability of current SID methods may still be limited in real scenario, and the deraining results also cannot effectively improve subsequent high-level tasks (e.g., object detection). The main reason may be because the current works mainly focus on designing new deraining networks, while neglecting the interpretation of the solving process. To investigate these issues, we in this paper re-examine the three factors (i.e.,data, rain model and network architecture) for the SID task, and specifically analyze them by proposing new and more reasonable criteria (i.e., general vs. specific, synthetical vs. mathematical, black-box vs. whitebox). We will also study the relationship of the three factors from new perspectives of data, and reveal two different solving paradigms (explicit vs. implicit) for SID. We further discuss the properties of the data-driven SID methods from five aspects, i.e., training strategy, network pipeline, domain knowledge, data preprocessing and objective function, with some useful conclusions provided by statistics. Besides, we also profoundly studied one of the three factors, i.e., data, and measured the performance of current methods on different datasets via extensive experiments to reveal the effectiveness of SID data.

As images captured in outdoor often share similar scenes and their visibility varies with depth from camera, such semantic and geometric information provides a strong prior for snowy image restoration. We incorporate the semantic and geometric maps as input and learn the semantic-aware and geometry-aware representation to remove snow. In particular, we first create a coarse network to remove snow from the input images. Then, the coarsely desnowed images are fed into another network to obtain the semantic and geometric labels. Finally, we design a DDMSNet to learn semantic-aware and geometry-aware representation via a self-attention mechanism to produce the final clean images.

In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator. This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords = {Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JEH8GCYI/Zhang et al. - 2019 - Image De-raining Using a Conditional Generative Ad.pdf;/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/527DY9EL/1701.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764704,"version":0},"$loki":2812},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":337,"entry":"@article{zhangImageEnhancementIndented2019,\n  title = {Image {{Enhancement}} via {{Indented Frame Over Fusion}}},\n  author = {Zhang, Baoju and Yan, Wenrui and Li, Gang and Fei, Jingqi and Zhang, Cuiping and Chen, Chuyi},\n  date = {2019},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  volume = {7},\n  pages = {181092--181099},\n  issn = {2169-3536},\n  doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956747},\n  abstract = {In this era of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of things (IoT) with the capability of connecting a great number of heterogeneous terminals and the popularity of mobile devices, which makes more devices available as another pair of eyes for people, such as video surveillance and smart navigation.

Furthermore, an additional control force is introduced to transcribe the artificial potential field model into an optimal control problem, and the equality/inequality constraints on the description of the shape of the obstacles are substituted by the repulsive force originating from all the obstacles. The Legendre pseudospectral method and virtual motion camouflage are both utilized to solve the modified optimal control problem for comparison purposes. The algorithm presented in this paper improves the performance of solving the trajectory-planning problem in an obstacle-rich environment.

In this paper, we introduce the idea of using a partial-final-state-free (PFF) optimal controller in kinodynamic RRT* [1] to reduce the dimensionality of the sampling space. Instead of sampling the full state space, the proposed accelerated kinodynamic RRT*, called Kino-RRT*, only samples part of the state space, while the rest of the states are selected by the PFF optimal controller. We also propose a delayed and intermittent update of the optimal arrival time of all the edges in the RRT* tree to decrease the computation complexity.

Abstraction has been mainly studied in problem solving, theorem proving, knowledge representation (in particular for spatial and temporal reasoning) and machine learning. In such contexts, abstraction is defined as a mapping between formalisms that reduces the computational complexity of the task at stake. By analysing the notion of abstraction from an information quantity point of view, we pinpoint the differences and the complementary role of reformulation and abstraction in any representation change. We contribute to extending the existing semantic theories of abstraction to be grounded on perception, where the notion of information quantity is easier to characterize formally. In the author's view, abstraction is best represented using abstraction operators, as they provide semantics for classifying different abstractions and support the automation of representation changes. The usefulness of a grounded theory of abstraction in the cartography domain is illustrated. Finally, the importance of explicitly representing abstraction for designing more autonomous and adaptive systems is discussed.},\n  pmcid = {PMC1693211},\n  file = {/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/9Z6CREGQ/Zucker - 2003 - A grounded theory of abstraction in artificial int.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816764733,"version":0},"$loki":2827}],"idIndex":null,"binaryIndices":{"itemID":{"name":"itemID","dirty":true,"values":[284,207,10,292,80,16,172,71,210,70,392,83,43,14,62,169,266,85,270,312,53,394,39,289,201,395,6,301,110,265,315,195,302,357,174,228,200,254,196,309,343,249,324,138,7,271,360,291,17,171,278,216,381,150,11,5,242,363,115,326,243,248,237,274,297,204,293,48,267,8,45,194,272,214,137,346,386,56,295,42,224,259,399,356,136,77,19,300,87,175,298,206,258,331,73,330,397,390,354,339,156,179,389,223,129,398,329,165,134,236,146,269,0,2,164,49,226,262,239,9,257,261,376,388,303,373,240,318,348,211,221,47,287,94,244,36,342,355,181,391,182,268,311,148,321,294,337,163,320,307,319,322,191,212,190,189,188,227,367,347,351,142,100,20,98,187,378,235,168,375,130,133,379,15,112,202,377,51,84,50,159,328,109,205,88,247,316,58,393,151,229,209,323,93,34,65,333,327,68,61,296,288,35,41,114,368,57,338,280,12,325,18,215,117,170,55,127,177,281,193,128,245,217,334,102,101,104,37,116,78,113,306,161,160,310,382,308,3,336,4,234,145,277,370,369,364,183,208,362,46,67,132,263,241,225,103,380,387,198,82,304,220,79,1,180,111,290,213,203,260,286,149,69,32,119,139,125,158,186,340,74,25,178,372,366,238,24,23,123,29,28,31,279,122,185,332,76,121,22,120,40,124,75,173,155,33,27,72,374,251,157,141,276,275,250,358,91,96,97,147,199,317,167,282,283,192,264,285,30,152,154,359,118,99,143,140,344,54,166,26,313,314,252,233,219,361,66,59,90,89,176,231,81,107,60,153,230,106,64,353,396,21,108,305,222,63,273,92,341,38,86,197,335,256,162,131,144,383,126,352,345,350,105,95,349,365,135,384,371,385,44,253,184,255,232,52,299,400,13,218,246]},"exportNotes":{"name":"exportNotes","dirty":true,"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,337,338,339,340,341,342,343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,351,352,353,354,355,356,357,358,359,360,361,362,363,364,365,366,367,368,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,376,377,378,379,380,381,382,383,384,385,386,387,388,389,390,391,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399]},"useJournalAbbreviation":{"name":"useJournalAbbreviation","dirty":true,"values":[]},"asciiBibLaTeX":{"name":"asciiBibLaTeX","dirty":true,"values":[]},"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":{"name":"biblatexExtendedNameFormat","dirty":true,"values":[]},"DOIandURL":{"name":"DOIandURL","dirty":true,"values":[]}},"constraints":null,"uniqueNames":[],"transforms":{"Better BibTeX metadata":[{"type":"Better BibTeX metadata","value":{"BetterBibTeX":"6.7.36"}}]},"objType":"Better BibLaTeX","dirty":false,"cachedIndex":null,"cachedBinaryIndex":null,"cachedData":null,"adaptiveBinaryIndices":false,"transactional":false,"cloneObjects":true,"cloneMethod":"parse-stringify","asyncListeners":false,"disableMeta":false,"disableChangesApi":true,"disableDeltaChangesApi":true,"autoupdate":false,"serializableIndices":true,"disableFreeze":true,"ttl":null,"maxId":2827,"DynamicViews":[],"events":{"insert":[],"update":[],"pre-insert":[],"pre-update":[],"close":[],"flushbuffer":[],"error":[],"delete":[null],"warning":[null]},"changes":[],"dirtyIds":[]}
