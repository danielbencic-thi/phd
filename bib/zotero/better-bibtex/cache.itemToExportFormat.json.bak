Decades of research and engineering have been dedicated to developing sophisticated navigation systems to move mobile robots from one point to another. Despite their overall success, a recently emerging research thrust is devoted to developing machine learning techniques to address the same problem, based in large part on the success of deep learning. However, to date, there has not been much direct comparison between the classical and emerging paradigms to this problem. In this article, we survey recent works that apply machine learning for motion planning and control in mobile robot navigation, within the context of classical navigation systems. The surveyed works are classified into different categories, which delineate the relationship of the learning approaches to classical methods. Based on this classification, we identify common challenges and promising future directions.","date":"2022-06-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Motion planning and control for mobile robot navigation using machine learning","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-022-10039-8","accessDate":"2022-08-08T10:27:15Z","volume":"46","pages":"569-597","publicationTitle":"Autonomous Robots","DOI":"10.1007/s10514-022-10039-8","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Auton Robot","ISSN":"1573-7527","creators":[{"firstName":"Xuesu","lastName":"Xiao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Garrett","lastName":"Warnell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Stone","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"Motion planning","type":1},{"tag":"Mobile robot navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Motion control","type":1}],"collections":["XEGDLIT3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-08T10:27:15Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T13:54:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2GT3YSNR","itemID":1042,"attachments":[{"key":"8ND5BPG5","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10514-022-10039-8.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-08T10:27:16Z","parentItem":"2GT3YSNR","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Xiao et al. - 2022 - Motion planning and control for mobile robot navig.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-08T10:27:16Z","dateModified":"2022-08-08T10:27:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8ND5BPG5","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8ND5BPG5/Xiao et al. - 2022 - Motion planning and control for mobile robot navig.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1043/Xiao et al. - 2022 - Motion planning and control for mobile robot navig.pdf"}],"notes":[{"key":"UD5JMXYY","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"2GT3YSNR","note":"<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p>Focuses on learning global, local and the whole navigation stack.</p>\n</div>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-08T10:28:26Z","dateModified":"2022-08-08T10:28:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/UD5JMXYY"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762169,"version":0},"$loki":899},{"itemID":814,"item":{"key":"2IGU5J73","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"Bayesian Optimization","creators":[{"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Garnett","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-21T11:15:10Z","dateModified":"2022-06-21T11:16:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2IGU5J73","itemID":814,"attachments":[{"key":"7P75EXJ7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"bayesoptbook_a4.pdf","url":"https://bayesoptbook.com/book/bayesoptbook_a4.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-21T11:14:45Z","parentItem":"2IGU5J73","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"bayesoptbook_a4.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-21T11:14:45Z","dateModified":"2022-06-21T11:15:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7P75EXJ7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/7P75EXJ7/bayesoptbook_a4.pdf","defaultPath":"files/813/bayesoptbook_a4.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762170,"version":0},"$loki":900},{"itemID":38,"item":{"key":"2KEGQ3LX","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Minimum snap trajectory generation and control for quadrotors","abstractNote":"We address the controller design and the trajectory generation for a quadrotor maneuvering in three dimensions in a tightly constrained setting typical of indoor environments.

We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through specified corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses.","date":"2011-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"2520-2525","proceedingsTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","conferenceName":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980409","creators":[{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Mellinger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Acceleration","type":1},{"tag":"Aerodynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Angular velocity","type":1},{"tag":"Force","type":1},{"tag":"Rotors","type":1},{"tag":"üîñ"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:30:17Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:47:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2KEGQ3LX","itemID":38,"attachments":[{"key":"YD345L9J","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5980409/?arnumber=5980409","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:30:27Z","parentItem":"2KEGQ3LX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"5980409.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:30:27Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:30:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YD345L9J","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/YD345L9J/5980409.html","defaultPath":"files/40/5980409.html"},{"key":"FHSDB2KX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980409&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NTk4MDQwOQ==","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:30:21Z","parentItem":"2KEGQ3LX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mellinger and Kumar -

Planning algorithms effectively reason over long horizons, but assume access to a local policy and distance metric over collision-free paths. Reinforcement learning excels at learning policies and relative values of states, but fails to plan over long horizons. Despite the successes of each method on various tasks, long horizon, sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional observations remain exceedingly challenging for both planning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Frustratingly, these sorts of tasks are potentially the most useful, as they are simple to design (a human only need to provide an example goal state) and avoid injecting bias through reward shaping. We introduce a general-purpose control algorithm that combines the strengths of planning and reinforcement learning to effectively solve these tasks. Our main idea is to decompose the task of reaching a distant goal state into a sequence of easier tasks, each of which corresponds to reaching a particular subgoal. We use goal-conditioned RL to learn a policy to reach each waypoint and to learn a distance metric for search. Using graph search over our replay buffer, we can automatically generate this sequence of subgoals, even in image-based environments. Our algorithm, search on the replay buffer (SoRB), enables agents to solve sparse reward tasks over hundreds of steps, and generalizes substantially better than standard RL algorithms.","date":"2019","shortTitle":"Search on the Replay Buffer","libraryCatalog":"Neural Information Processing Systems","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/5c48ff18e0a47baaf81d8b8ea51eec92-Abstract.html","accessDate":"2022-06-24T15:02:36Z","volume":"32","publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","proceedingsTitle":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Eysenbach","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Russ R","lastName":"Salakhutdinov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Levine","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T15:02:36Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T15:02:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2TUS9MCC","itemID":876,"attachments":[{"key":"DJ2SD2U7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/5c48ff18e0a47baaf81d8b8ea51eec92-Paper.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-24T15:02:37Z","parentItem":"2TUS9MCC","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Eysenbach et al. -

However, the understanding of their performance in industrial applications is still limited.  We investigate MCTS and Depth-First Proof-Number (DFPN) Search, a PNS variant, in the domain of Retrosynthetic Analysis (RA). \nWe find that DFPN's strengths, that justify its success in games, have limited value in RA, and that an enhanced MCTS variant by Segler et al. significantly outperforms DFPN.  We address this disadvantage of DFPN in RA with a novel approach to combine DFPN with Heuristic Edge Initialization.  Our new search algorithm DFPN-E outperforms the enhanced MCTS in search time by a factor of 3 on average, with comparable success rates.","date":"2019","libraryCatalog":"Neural Information Processing Systems","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/4fc28b7093b135c21c7183ac07e928a6-Abstract.html","accessDate":"2022-06-24T14:59:07Z","volume":"32","publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","proceedingsTitle":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Kishimoto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Beat","lastName":"Buesser","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bei","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adi","lastName":"Botea","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T14:59:08Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T14:59:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2W5FUT4K","itemID":868,"attachments":[{"key":"DKKVRPBF","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/4fc28b7093b135c21c7183ac07e928a6-Paper.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-24T14:59:09Z","parentItem":"2W5FUT4K","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kishimoto et al. - 2019 - Depth-First Proof-Number Search with Heuristic Edg.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T14:59:09Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T14:59:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/DKKVRPBF","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/DKKVRPBF/Kishimoto et al. - 2019 - Depth-First Proof-Number Search with Heuristic Edg.pdf","defaultPath":"files/869/Kishimoto et al. - 2019 - Depth-First Proof-Number Search with Heuristic Edg.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762177,"version":0},"$loki":906},{"itemID":1282,"item":{"key":"2YVQVZNG","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Homotopy and alternative routes in indoor navigation scenarios","abstractNote":"There are lots of innovative use cases possible that build on a shortest route between two locations together with a set of alternatives that are highly different yet short. Imagine, for example, a complicated building like an airport, where passengers can consult a computer terminal to get navigation advices to a desired goal. By scanning the boarding card the calculation of alternatives can be made context-sensitive. Based on gender, amount of time, or shopping preferences, for example, the terminal can display different routes regarding floors traversed, or shops and restaurants passed. Furthermore, the building operator can control the presentation of alternatives in order to influence visitor flows in real time. Therefore, we propose to use the topological concept of homotopy in order to decide if two routes should be considered equivalent or alternative. Basically, the homotopy relation identifies equivalence classes. We propose that a representative of an equivalence class is an alternative regarding another equivalence class. We concatenate the two routes in question and thus, create a polygon. If there is an obstacle inside, the routes are non-homotopic and we consider them as proper alternatives. For this situation, we propose two fundamentally different approaches that are able to find alternative routes with respect to homotopy. The input is a building plan in form of an occupancy grid. Bitmaps allow for fast calculation of the homotopy relation and can be generated from almost any type of environmental model. The first approach aims for enumerating routes that have to visit a special supporting point. This concatenation of two shortest paths leads to alternatives very fast. The second approach is orthogonal to that in the sense that it generates alternatives roughly ordered by their length. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the approaches' feasibility based on different metrics in several scenarios.","date":"2014-10","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"230-238","proceedingsTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","conferenceName":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","DOI":"10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275488","creators":[{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Werner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Feld","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Buildings","type":1},{"tag":"Measurement","type":1},{"tag":"Roads","type":1},{"tag":"Indoor navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Solids","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T13:29:10Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T13:29:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2YVQVZNG","itemID":1282,"attachments":[{"key":"A4AE6FW5","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7275488?arnumber=7275488","accessDate":"2022-08-23T13:29:21Z","parentItem":"2YVQVZNG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7275488.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T13:29:21Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T13:29:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/A4AE6FW5","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/A4AE6FW5/7275488.html","defaultPath":"files/1284/7275488.html"},{"key":"IARJHWPV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275488&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzI3NTQ4OA==","accessDate":"2022-08-23T13:29:14Z","parentItem":"2YVQVZNG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Werner and Feld - 2014 - Homotopy and alternative routes in indoor navigati.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T13:29:14Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T13:29:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IARJHWPV","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/IARJHWPV/Werner and Feld - 2014 - Homotopy and alternative routes in indoor navigati.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1283/Werner and Feld - 2014 - Homotopy and alternative routes in indoor navigati.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762178,"version":0},"$loki":907},{"itemID":1052,"item":{"key":"33BZA9CM","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Path Planning Techniques for Mobile Robots A Review","abstractNote":"Mobile robots have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering a wide range of applications in areas such as industry, agriculture, search and rescue and much more.

The robot should be capable of extracting the necessary information from the environment and taking the necessary action required to plan a feasible path for collision free motion to reach its goal.

The optimal algorithm in this class, LazySP, lazily restricts edge evaluation to only the shortest path. Doing so comes at the expense of search effort, i.e., LazySP must recompute the search tree every time an edge is found to be invalid. This becomes prohibitively expensive when dealing with large graphs or highly cluttered environments. Our key insight is the need to balance both edge evaluation and search effort to minimize the total planning time. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a framework, Generalized Lazy Search (GLS), that seamlessly toggles between search and evaluation to prevent wasted efforts. We show that for a choice of toggle, GLS is provably more efficient than LazySP. Second, we leverage prior experience of edge probabilities to derive GLS policies that minimize expected planning time. We show that GLS equipped with such priors significantly outperforms competitive baselines for many simulated environments in R2, SE(2) and 7-DoF manipulation.","date":"2019-07-22","shortTitle":"Generalized Lazy Search for Robot Motion Planning","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02795","accessDate":"2022-06-24T13:09:50Z","extra":"Number: arXiv:1904.02795\narXiv:1904.02795 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1904.02795","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:1904.02795","creators":[{"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Mandalika","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sanjiban","lastName":"Choudhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Salzman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Siddhartha","lastName":"Srinivasa","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T13:09:50Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T13:09:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/45EEWZ6R","itemID":856,"attachments":[{"key":"GM5YGWDX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02795.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-24T13:09:58Z","parentItem":"45EEWZ6R","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mandalika et al. - 2019 - Generalized Lazy Search for Robot Motion Planning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T13:09:58Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T13:09:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GM5YGWDX","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/GM5YGWDX/Mandalika et al. - 2019 - Generalized Lazy Search for Robot Motion Planning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/858/Mandalika et al. - 2019 - Generalized Lazy Search for Robot Motion Planning.pdf"},{"key":"54MDFVCF","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02795","accessDate":"2022-06-24T13:10:03Z","parentItem":"45EEWZ6R","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1904.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T13:10:03Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T13:10:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/54MDFVCF","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/54MDFVCF/1904.html","defaultPath":"files/859/1904.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"QZQCD74X","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"45EEWZ6R","note":"Comment: Accepted at International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2019","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T13:09:50Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T13:09:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QZQCD74X"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762185,"version":0},"$loki":914},{"itemID":913,"item":{"key":"46GIRMDV","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Path Planning with CPD Heuristics","abstractNote":"Compressed Path Databases (CPDs) are a leading technique for optimal pathÔ¨Ånding in graphs with static edge costs.

Conventional heuristics derive cost-to-go estimates by reasoning about a tentative and usually infeasible path, from the current node to the target. CPD-based heuristics derive cost-to-go estimates by computing a concrete and usually feasible path. We exploit such paths to bound the optimal solution, not just from below but also from above.

Methods from topological data analysis, e.g., persistent homology, enable us to obtain such information, typically in the form of summary representations of topological features. However, such topological signatures often come with an unusual structure (e.g., multisets of intervals) that is highly impractical for most machine learning techniques. While many strategies have been proposed to map these topological signatures into machine learning compatible representations, they suffer from being agnostic to the target learning task. In contrast, we propose a technique that enables us to input topological signatures to deep neural networks and learn a task-optimal representation during training. Our approach is realized as a novel input layer with favorable theoretical properties.

Our algorithm employs the heuristic that nearby configurations are likely to be invalidated by the same change. To find diverse short paths, the algorithm finds the shortest detour avoiding a collection of balls imposed on the graph as simulated obstacles. Different collections yield different short paths. Paths may then be checked for validity as a cheap alternative to checking or reconstructing the entire roadmap. We describe a formal definition of path set diversity and several measures on which to evaluate our algorithm. We compare the speed and quality of our heuristic algorithm's results against an exact algorithm that computes the optimally shortest set of paths on the roadmap having a minimum diversity. We show that, with tolerable loss in shortness, we produce equally diverse path sets orders of magnitude more quickly.","date":"2015-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"4173-4179","proceedingsTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","conferenceName":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139774","creators":[{"firstName":"Caleb","lastName":"Voss","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Moll","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lydia E.","lastName":"Kavraki","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Robustness","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"Measurement","type":1},{"tag":"Routing","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T07:02:37Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T07:02:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/4HTX8FNT","itemID":1473,"attachments":[{"key":"WJHMCQSB","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7139774/?arnumber=7139774","accessDate":"2022-10-06T07:02:49Z","parentItem":"4HTX8FNT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7139774.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T07:02:49Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T07:02:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WJHMCQSB","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WJHMCQSB/7139774.html","defaultPath":"files/1475/7139774.html"},{"key":"XGRVI4I9","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139774&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzEzOTc3NA==","accessDate":"2022-10-06T07:02:41Z","parentItem":"4HTX8FNT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Voss et al. - 2015 - A heuristic approach to finding diverse short path.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T07:02:41Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T07:02:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XGRVI4I9","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XGRVI4I9/Voss et al. - 2015 - A heuristic approach to finding diverse short path.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1474/Voss et al. - 2015 - A heuristic approach to finding diverse short path.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762188,"version":0},"$loki":917},{"itemID":1374,"item":{"key":"4IKK6A3L","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Planning under topological constraints using beam-graphs","abstractNote":"We present a framework based on graph search for navigation in the plane with a variety of topological constraints.

While there are various ways to formally capture multilevel abstractions, we formulate them in terms of fiber bundles, which allows us to concisely describe and derive novel algorithms in terms of bundle restrictions and bundle sections. Fiber bundles essentially describe lower-dimensional projections of the state space using local product spaces. Given such a structure and a corresponding admissible constraint function, we can develop highly efficient and optimal search-based motion planning methods for high-dimensional state spaces. Our contributions are the following: We first introduce the terminology of fiber bundles, in particular the notion of restrictions and sections. Second, we use the notion of restrictions and sections to develop novel multilevel motion planning algorithms, which we call QRRT* and QMP*. We show these algorithms to be probabilistically complete and almost-surely asymptotically optimal. Third, we develop a novel recursive path section method based on an L1 interpolation over path restrictions, which we use to quickly find feasible path sections. And fourth, we evaluate all novel algorithms against all available OMPL algorithms on benchmarks of eight challenging environments ranging from 21 to 100 degrees of freedom, including multiple robots and nonholonomic constraints. Our findings support the efficiency of our novel algorithms and the benefit of exploiting multilevel abstractions using the terminology of fiber bundles.","date":"2020-07-18","shortTitle":"Multilevel Motion Planning","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09435","accessDate":"2022-09-15T07:22:16Z","extra":"arXiv:2007.09435 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2007.09435","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:2007.09435","creators":[{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Orthey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sohaib","lastName":"Akbar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Toussaint","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-15T07:22:16Z","dateModified":"2022-09-15T07:22:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5359G445","itemID":1397,"attachments":[{"key":"S7CSEHC5","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09435.pdf","accessDate":"2022-09-15T07:22:22Z","parentItem":"5359G445","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Orthey et al. - 2020 - Multilevel Motion Planning A Fiber Bundle Formula.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-15T07:22:22Z","dateModified":"2022-09-15T07:22:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/S7CSEHC5","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/S7CSEHC5/Orthey et al. - 2020 - Multilevel Motion Planning A Fiber Bundle Formula.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1399/Orthey et al. - 2020 - Multilevel Motion Planning A Fiber Bundle Formula.pdf"},{"key":"7PTEC3CH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09435","accessDate":"2022-09-15T07:22:27Z","parentItem":"5359G445","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2007.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-15T07:22:27Z","dateModified":"2022-09-15T07:22:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7PTEC3CH","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/7PTEC3CH/2007.html","defaultPath":"files/1400/2007.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"EX9Z2LD7","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"5359G445","note":"Comment: Submitted to IJRR","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-15T07:22:16Z","dateModified":"2022-09-15T07:22:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EX9Z2LD7"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762194,"version":0},"$loki":921},{"itemID":1389,"item":{"key":"53RAFRCS","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Topological Complexity of Motion Planning","abstractNote":"Abstract.  In this paper we study a notion of topological complexity TC(X)  for the motion planning problem. TC(X)  is a number which measures discontinuity of the process of motion planning in the configuration space X . More precisely, TC(X)  is the minimal number k  such that there are k  different \"motion planning rules,\" each defined on an open subset of X√ó X , so that each rule is continuous in the source and target configurations. We use methods of algebraic topology (the Lusternik‚ÄîSchnirelman theory) to study the topological complexity TC(X) . We give an upper bound for TC(X)  (in terms of the dimension of the configuration space X ) and also a lower bound (in terms of the structure of the cohomology algebra of X ). We explicitly compute the topological complexity of motion planning for a number of configuration spaces: spheres, two-dimensional surfaces, products of spheres. In particular, we completely calculate the topological complexity of the problem of motion planning for a robot arm in the absence of obstacles.","date":"2003-01-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00454-002-0760-9","accessDate":"2022-09-14T08:54:26Z","volume":"29","pages":"211-221","publicationTitle":"Discrete & Computational Geometry","DOI":"10.1007/s00454-002-0760-9","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Discrete Comput Geom","ISSN":"1432-0444","creators":[{"name":"Farber","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Configuration Space","type":1},{"tag":"Motion Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Algebraic Topology","type":1},{"tag":"Open Subset","type":1},{"tag":"Planning Problem","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-14T08:54:26Z","dateModified":"2022-10-27T07:58:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/53RAFRCS","itemID":1389,"attachments":[{"key":"87JBKRUM","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00454-002-0760-9.pdf","accessDate":"2022-09-14T08:54:27Z","parentItem":"53RAFRCS","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Farber - 2003 - Topological Complexity of Motion Planning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-14T08:54:27Z","dateModified":"2022-09-14T08:54:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/87JBKRUM","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/87JBKRUM/Farber - 2003 - Topological Complexity of Motion Planning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1390/Farber - 2003 - Topological Complexity of Motion Planning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762195,"version":0},"$loki":922},{"itemID":1385,"item":{"key":"53UWJN4R","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Motion planning in tori","abstractNote":"Let X be a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of the n-dimensional torus.

Our convolutional neural network(CNN), NVDeHazenet learns to predict both the original signal as well as the atmospheric light to finally restore image quality. It outperforms the existing state of the art methods by evaluation on both synthetic data as well as real world hazy images. The deraining CNN, NVDeRainNet shows similar performance on existing rain datasets as the state of the art. On natural rain images NVDeRainNet shows better than state of the art performance. We show the use of perceptual loss to improve the visual quality of results. These networks require considerable amount of data under adverse weather conditions and their respective ground truth for training. For this purpose we use a weather simulation framework to simulate synthetic rainy and foggy environments.

To avoid the non-convex constraints normally required for obstacle-avoidance, we perform a mixed-integer optimization in which polynomial trajectories are assigned to convex regions which are known to be obstacle-free. Prior approaches have used the faces of the obstacles themselves to define these convex regions. We instead use IRIS, a recently developed technique for greedy convex segmentation [1], to pre-compute convex regions of safe space. This results in a substantially reduced number of integer variables, which improves the speed with which the optimization can be solved to its global optimum, even for tens or hundreds of obstacle faces. In addition, prior approaches have typically enforced obstacle avoidance at a finite set of sample or knot points. We introduce a technique based on sums-of-squares (SOS) programming that allows us to ensure that the entire piecewise polynomial trajectory is free of collisions using convex constraints. We demonstrate this technique in 2D and in 3D using a dynamical model in the Drake toolbox for Matlab [2].","date":"2015-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"42-49","proceedingsTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","conferenceName":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7138978","creators":[{"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Deits","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Russ","lastName":"Tedrake","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Iris","type":1},{"tag":"Linear programming","type":1},{"tag":"Polynomials","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:25:51Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:25:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5DZLTUWI","itemID":66,"attachments":[{"key":"V2TY447B","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7138978/?arnumber=7138978&tag=1","accessDate":"2022-04-19T15:25:59Z","parentItem":"5DZLTUWI","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7138978.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:25:59Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:25:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/V2TY447B","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/V2TY447B/7138978.html","defaultPath":"files/68/7138978.html"},{"key":"S3Z5QHH8","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138978&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzEzODk3OA==","accessDate":"2022-04-19T15:25:53Z","parentItem":"5DZLTUWI","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Deits and Tedrake - 2015 - Efficient mixed-integer planning for UAVs in clutt.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:25:53Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:25:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/S3Z5QHH8","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/S3Z5QHH8/Deits and Tedrake - 2015 - Efficient mixed-integer planning for UAVs in clutt.pdf","defaultPath":"files/67/Deits and Tedrake - 2015 - Efficient mixed-integer planning for UAVs in clutt.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762201,"version":0},"$loki":927},{"itemID":991,"item":{"key":"5EEKXMTT","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Online Graph Pruning for Pathfinding On Grid Maps","abstractNote":"Pathfinding in uniform-cost grid environments is a problem commonly found in application areas such as robotics and video games. The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathfinding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identifies and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We find that searching with jump points can speed up A* by an order of magnitude and more and report significant improvement over the current state of the art.","date":"2011-08-04","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ojs.aaai.org","callNumber":"JPS","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/7994","accessDate":"2022-07-15T14:03:40Z","rights":"Copyright (c) 2021 Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","extra":"Number: 1","volume":"25","pages":"1114-1119","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","issue":"1","ISSN":"2374-3468","creators":[{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Harabor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alban","lastName":"Grastien","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9BA2PRD7"],"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/DCY53JKY"]},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T10:16:50Z","dateModified":"2022-08-10T14:40:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5EEKXMTT","itemID":991,"attachments":[{"key":"YPLM9R3K","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/7994/7853","accessDate":"2022-07-15T14:03:42Z","parentItem":"5EEKXMTT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Harabor and Grastien - 2011 - Online Graph Pruning for Pathfinding On Grid Maps.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MD9BBQUV"]},"dateAdded":"2022-07-15T14:03:42Z","dateModified":"2022-08-10T14:40:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YPLM9R3K","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/YPLM9R3K/Harabor and Grastien - 2011 - Online Graph Pruning for Pathfinding On Grid Maps.pdf","defaultPath":"files/992/Harabor and Grastien - 2011 - Online Graph Pruning for Pathfinding On Grid Maps.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762202,"version":0},"$loki":928},{"itemID":489,"item":{"key":"5EQ334LC","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Variable-Speed Traveling Salesman Problem for Vehicles with Curvature Constrained Trajectories","abstractNote":"This paper presents a novel approach to the multigoal trajectory planning for vehicles with curvature-constrained trajectories such as fixed-wing aircraft. In the existing formulation called the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP), the vehicle speed is assumed to be constant over the whole trajectory, and that does not allow adaptation of the turning radius of the trajectory between the target locations. It does not support optimization of the overall flight time of the multi-goal trajectory by exploiting higher speeds for longer turning radii. Therefore, we propose a novel problem formulation called the Variable-Speed Traveling Salesman Problem (VS-TSP) that employs time-efficient trajectories with variable speed based on a generalization of the Dubins vehicle model, allowing multiple turning radii and change of the forward speed of the vehicle. The VS-TSP allows the vehicle to slow down if high maneuverability is necessary and speed up if high-speed turns with a large radius are beneficial to the overall tour cost. Based on the evaluation results for Cessna 172 aircraft model, the proposed VNS-based algorithm with variable speed provides up to about 20 % faster trajectories than a solution of the DTSP with a single turning radius.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"4714-4719","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636762","creators":[{"firstName":"Krist√Ωna","lastName":"Kuƒçerov√°","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"V√°≈àa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Faigl","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Atmospheric modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Computational modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory planning","type":1},{"tag":"Traveling salesman problems","type":1},{"tag":"Costs","type":1},{"tag":"Turning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:25:33Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:25:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5EQ334LC","itemID":489,"attachments":[{"key":"87KDGUJJ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636762?arnumber=9636762","accessDate":"2022-05-18T14:25:47Z","parentItem":"5EQ334LC","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9636762.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:25:47Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:25:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/87KDGUJJ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/87KDGUJJ/9636762.html","defaultPath":"files/491/9636762.html"},{"key":"XEIYAPYU","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9636762&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTYzNjc2Mg==","accessDate":"2022-05-18T14:25:35Z","parentItem":"5EQ334LC","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kuƒçerov√° et al. - 2021 - Variable-Speed Traveling Salesman Problem for Vehi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:25:35Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:25:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XEIYAPYU","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XEIYAPYU/Kuƒçerov√° et al. - 2021 - Variable-Speed Traveling Salesman Problem for Vehi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/490/Kuƒçerov√° et al. - 2021 - Variable-Speed Traveling Salesman Problem for Vehi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762203,"version":0},"$loki":929},{"itemID":1285,"item":{"key":"5JNH8KQR","version":0,"itemType":"report","title":"The Field D* Algorithm for Improved Path Planning and Replanning in Uniform and Non-uniform Cost Environments","abstractNote":"Abstract. We present an interpolation-based planning and replanning algorithm for generating smooth paths through non-uniform cost grids. Most grid-based path planners use discrete state transitions that artificially constrain an agent‚Äôs motion to a small set of possible headings (e.g. 0, œÄ œÄ, , etc). As a result, even the ‚Äòop-4 2 timal ‚Äô grid planners produce unnatural, suboptimal paths for the agent to traverse. Our approach uses linear interpolation during planning to calculate accurate path cost estimates for arbitrary positions within each grid cell and to produce paths with a range of continuous headings. Consequently, it is particularly well suited to planning smooth, least-cost trajectories for mobile robots. In this paper, we present a number of applications and results, a comparison to related algorithms, and several implementations on real robotic systems. 1","date":"2005","libraryCatalog":"CiteSeer","creators":[{"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Ferguson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Stentz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T14:06:09Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T14:06:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5JNH8KQR","itemID":1285,"attachments":[{"key":"2W53M4FU","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Citeseer - Full Text PDF","url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=A69C977E18D1D1C6966DEBC512BBE9A4?doi=10.1.1.73.805&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-23T14:06:12Z","parentItem":"5JNH8KQR","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ferguson and Stentz - 2005 - The Field D Algorithm for Improved Path Planning .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T14:06:12Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T14:06:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2W53M4FU","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2W53M4FU/Ferguson and Stentz - 2005 - The Field D Algorithm for Improved Path Planning .pdf","defaultPath":"files/1286/Ferguson and Stentz - 2005 - The Field D Algorithm for Improved Path Planning .pdf"},{"key":"SIKKYYSH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Citeseer - Snapshot","url":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.73.805","accessDate":"2022-08-23T14:06:14Z","parentItem":"5JNH8KQR","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"summary.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T14:06:14Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T14:06:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SIKKYYSH","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SIKKYYSH/summary.html","defaultPath":"files/1287/summary.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762204,"version":0},"$loki":930},{"itemID":1407,"item":{"key":"5MININY7","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Topology of parametrised motion planning algorithms","abstractNote":"In this paper we introduce and study a new concept of parametrised topological complexity, a topological invariant motivated by the motion planning problem of robotics.

To further improve the de-rained result, we use a priori image domain knowledge by focusing on high frequency detail during training, which removes background interference and focuses the model on the structure of rain in images. This demonstrates that a deep architecture not only has benefits for high-level vision tasks but also can be used to solve low-level imaging problems.

The basis of the framework is a novel trajectory representation built upon our novel optimality conditions for unconstrained control effort minimization. We design linear-complexity operations on this representation to conduct spatial‚Äìtemporal deformation under various planning requirements. Smooth maps are utilized to exactly eliminate geometrical constraints in a lightweight fashion. A variety of state-input constraints are supported by the decoupling of dense constraint evaluation from sparse parameterization and the backward differentiation of flatness map. As a result, this framework transforms a generally constrained multicopter planning problem into an unconstrained optimization that can be solved reliably and efficiently. Our framework bridges the gaps among solution quality, planning efficiency, and constraint fidelity for a multicopter with limited resources and maneuvering capability. Its generality and robustness are both demonstrated by applications to different flight tasks. Extensive simulations and benchmarks are also conducted to show its capability of generating high-quality solutions while retaining the computation speed against other specialized methods by orders of magnitude.","date":"2022","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pages":"1-10","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","DOI":"10.1109/TRO.2022.3160022","ISSN":"1941-0468","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhepei","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Safety","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory optimization","type":1},{"tag":"collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory planning","type":1},{"tag":"motion and path planning","type":1},{"tag":"üîñ"},{"tag":"autonomous vehicle navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Aerial systems","type":1},{"tag":"applications","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-09T14:10:31Z","dateModified":"2022-06-09T14:10:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/67D4YXQN","itemID":790,"attachments":[{"key":"992LGEF7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://undefined/document/9765821?arnumber=9765821","accessDate":"2022-06-09T14:10:48Z","parentItem":"67D4YXQN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9765821.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-09T14:10:48Z","dateModified":"2022-06-09T14:10:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/992LGEF7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/992LGEF7/9765821.html","defaultPath":"files/792/9765821.html"},{"key":"BVXYE9A4","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://undefined/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9765821&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTc2NTgyMQ==","accessDate":"2022-06-09T14:10:41Z","parentItem":"67D4YXQN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. -

In this work, we are concerned with estimating the pose from laser scans generated by an inexpensive and lightweight LIDAR. We propose a localization system for lightweight (under 200 g) LIDAR sensors with high reliability in arbitrary environments, where other methods fail. The general nature of the proposed method allows deployment in wide array of applications. Moreover, seamless transitioning between different kinds of environments is possible. The advantage of LIDAR localization is that it is robust to poor illumination, which is often challenging for camera-based solutions in dark indoor environments and in the case of the transition between indoor and outdoor environment. Our approach allows executing tasks in poorly-illuminated indoor locations such as historic buildings and warehouses, as well as in the tight outdoor environment, such as forest, where vision-based approaches fail due to large contrast of the scene, and where large well-equipped UAVs cannot be deployed due to the constrained space.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"243-251","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476837","creators":[{"firstName":"Matƒõj","lastName":"Petrl√≠k","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tom√°≈°","lastName":"Krajn√≠k","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Saska","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Three-dimensional displays","type":1},{"tag":"Laser radar","type":1},{"tag":"Sensor systems","type":1},{"tag":"Location awareness","type":1},{"tag":"Laser stability","type":1},{"tag":"Lighting","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:13:42Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:13:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6R2U2L4A","itemID":251,"attachments":[{"key":"MUA8STGR","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476837/?arnumber=9476837","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:13:58Z","parentItem":"6R2U2L4A","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476837.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:13:58Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:13:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MUA8STGR","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/MUA8STGR/9476837.html","defaultPath":"files/253/9476837.html"},{"key":"2TAXSERL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476837&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3NjgzNw==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:13:50Z","parentItem":"6R2U2L4A","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Petrl√≠k et al. - 2021 - LIDAR-based Stabilization, Navigation and Localiza.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:13:50Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:13:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2TAXSERL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2TAXSERL/Petrl√≠k et al. - 2021 - LIDAR-based Stabilization, Navigation and Localiza.pdf","defaultPath":"files/252/Petrl√≠k et al. - 2021 - LIDAR-based Stabilization, Navigation and Localiza.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762218,"version":0},"$loki":941},{"itemID":445,"item":{"key":"6R6PVWQF","version":0,"itemType":"report","title":"TransWeather: Transformer-based Restoration of Images Degraded by Adverse Weather Conditions","abstractNote":"Removing adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow from images is an important problem in many applications. Most methods proposed in the literature have been designed to deal with just removing one type of degradation. Recently, a CNN-based method using neural architecture search (All-in-One) was proposed to remove all the weather conditions at once. However, it has a large number of parameters as it uses multiple encoders to cater to each weather removal task and still has scope for improvement in its performance. In this work, we focus on developing an efficient solution for the all adverse weather removal problem. To this end, we propose TransWeather, a transformer-based end-to-end model with just a single encoder and a decoder that can restore an image degraded by any weather condition. Specifically, we utilize a novel transformer encoder using intra-patch transformer blocks to enhance attention inside the patches to effectively remove smaller weather degradations. We also introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather type embeddings to adjust to the weather degradation at hand. TransWeather achieves significant improvements across multiple test datasets over both All-in-One network as well as methods fine-tuned for specific tasks.

The RAPPIDS motion planner generates collision-free flight trajectories at high speed with low computational cost using only the latest depth image. In this work we extend it to improve the performance of the planner by taking the following issues into account. (a) Changes in the dynamic characteristics of the multicopter that occur during flight, such as changes in motor input/output characteristics due to battery voltage drop. (b) The noise of the flight sensor, which can cause unwanted control input components. (c) Planner utility function which may not be suitable for the cluttered environment. Therefore, in this paper we introduce solutions to each of the above problems and propose a system for the successful operation of the RAPPIDS planner in an outdoor cluttered flight environment. At the end of the paper, we validate the proposed method's effectiveness by presenting the flight experiment results in a forest environment.

Towards this end, the paper in hand presents a novel local path planning method, incorporating the support vector machines (SVM) theory. The original SVM based module exploits a 2D map of points which are considered to be obstacles, so as to culminate in a collision free path. A unique attribute of the proposed SVM based local path planning algorithm is that it considers the consecutive positions of the global path trajectory, the embodiment of the robot and clusters the obstacles accordingly. Thus, the derived trajectory is a physically constrained path inasmuch as it considers the maximum margin notion of the SVM theory. Instead of providing a purely theoretical approach for local planning assessed using only artificial data, we integrate our local planner into an autonomous navigation system which is evaluated in real-world scenarios in order to show its efficacy. The latter framework firstly constructs a global 3D metric map of the perceived environment and then it converts it into a 2D map upon which a global path planner unrolls. The global map grows incrementally, by registering the collected point clouds over the robot‚Äôs route towards a goal position. Moreover, the navigation is supported by an obstacle detection strategy based on v-disparity images. The system ‚Äì and, consequently, the presented local path planner ‚Äì was evaluated in long range outdoors scenarios, navigating successfully within congestive environments.","date":"08/2015","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921889015000342","accessDate":"2022-05-23T08:53:01Z","volume":"70","pages":"166-180","publicationTitle":"Robotics and Autonomous Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.robot.2015.02.010","journalAbbreviation":"Robotics and Autonomous Systems","ISSN":"09218890","creators":[{"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Charalampous","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Kostavelis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Antonios","lastName":"Gasteratos","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T08:53:01Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T08:53:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6X8B4DIC","itemID":513,"attachments":[{"key":"J6ANSJEG","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Charalampous et al. - 2015 - Thorough robot navigation based on SVM local plann.pdf","url":"https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271599/1-s2.0-S0921889015X00078/1-s2.0-S0921889015000342/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHAaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIApSuDl743sqpE0DVSDo32nBLSjssgJUbH8kB2vBVK5HAiASVM44t4PO6YoPI%2BtmQNn3tR%2F%2BiFYKA30DCNUue%2FQdaCrSBAhZEAQaDDA1OTAwMzU0Njg2NSIMUnRRckNk4zg16XUDKq8Er66uHWYshAlrQBkuSWo0T7LKbiW5%2FGtVRIgZqMuoZipcIH42I66XQxWIfeYBw%2FtHYBoC8O0uZYjcHHvIQpMZhQcS79SZVNa8k8DCgbyVatOyMNlsykpT4vU7ndGBPjoCR842fO14YQ23VB4y2cxHZMrTKj40u2NtwEgRL1Ic52a1DuC6OdkjYE2isLg9OfqgjdfPybhBLYY0g6Jwkh5it5s8gyUml7AANOHbq7UvJiZKOEGnBu4VlnEMPU77uvIvuov3%2Bm%2B%2Bvy2uSF874jTX0CvXR1uvtKH3TK8fhyl%2Fy4sQX%2BydO2DoyA%2FKsCaT7yLxJjZfQI1jtxkKa7Bcf2T0p6KdNjmU8ym2%2BU%2F8QXfo1s7XAhRtwWaJTF14WAliLUfs%2BlwDB3PJMNK9ZCPElBN92wy3cg1uRpoiXtQTLctoMwCeubO2K%2BPO9L2lP2BokUSXMtdOGVXT52hDAnWShJ2CAlaY3zJNrUiHfb%2FRMRg%2FMYdUvYwJ9nYe4NwHdMuglGRDmyjSII2TLOtaEqYUVz6L0l4dHES5rEJyNQlAkYXtJfIZ7K0j85%2B%2FhVI2r%2FwsrqIBKIN8devyzc%2FMl3jnU92rpqSCcMKhgtSSYiwbfl%2FLjRPECKl1OWRfyfuE%2FApggPNOVahMwM8izwn7uEKBHGVht8RrKq31eNiM5cUQANT10eUthTBMwzspJhX2ybnm5cZnsmU4Uny9SZ2Ccl8uGJnu%2BsRB0xRMTdyD5v6w0cQGGTCc%2FayUBjqqAeyparQhQ2941BCmEGPW0cze6aqYNPhA05iewTbkK5zxA9CgcITvC73psJxmMS8akDDM0LIqPD2ecGE5u5XYtsZZa62t8F7pC9RNjmRMAWquSEBRPNUMw1DHEWPKrNR%2BFTPafNhwPdjq5fxb8Tf2HMVn6vq9zsZcGaFjrpdHmRnuXB51vpDXx4qz1nMmfXRHgoYejqjSkoz9ir5oNUdNmmw9%2F%2Byyw6hE8%2FnE&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20220523T085247Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYXB2OHZVG%2F20220523%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=11db2222758313968c3e3428732a80791a0926a6585db844a37f5e01cf0b7f88&hash=d42a2058c930e9531e86cba31f1dc29269d8d734b1f17ff5c49096ac7e4b3903&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S0921889015000342&tid=spdf-5c914e25-3a12-4271-a644-b764f62afceb&sid=cbbe73733b0a0848cb0b3e5180d8e0e38074gxrqb&type=client&download=true&ua=4d5607035d0503545c5b57&rr=70fc8eb1293e6969","accessDate":"2022-05-23T08:52:59Z","parentItem":"6X8B4DIC","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Charalampous et al. - 2015 - Thorough robot navigation based on SVM local plann.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T08:52:59Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T08:53:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/J6ANSJEG","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/J6ANSJEG/Charalampous et al. - 2015 - Thorough robot navigation based on SVM local plann.pdf","defaultPath":"files/512/Charalampous et al. - 2015 - Thorough robot navigation based on SVM local plann.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762220,"version":0},"$loki":945},{"itemID":1480,"item":{"key":"6XJGLGKB","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Exploring Unstructured Environment with Frontier Trees","abstractNote":"This paper presents the frontier tree exploration algorithm, a novel approach to autonomously explore unknown and unstructured areas. Focus of this work is the exploration of domestic environments with lots of arbitrary obstacles, for example furbished appartements. Existing and well-studied approaches like greedy algorithms perform worse when obstacles are included and the range of distance sensors is limited. Base of this research is the frontier tree. This data structure offers two main features. Firstly it serves as a memory of past poses during exploration, where boundaries between known and unknown space are inserted into the tree. Secondly, the data structure is then utilized to decide between future navigation goals. This approach is compared to the class of nearest neighbor exploration algorithms and a decision theoretic approach. The algorithm is tested in a simulation study with furbished ground maps and in a real life domestic environment. The paper shows, that frontier trees exhibit a superior performance of distance traveled and the number of exploration steps compared to a nearest neighbor algorithm.","date":"9/2018","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10846-017-0754-8","accessDate":"2022-10-06T07:43:18Z","volume":"91","pages":"617-628","publicationTitle":"Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems","DOI":"10.1007/s10846-017-0754-8","issue":"3-4","journalAbbreviation":"J Intell Robot Syst","ISSN":"0921-0296, 1573-0409","creators":[{"firstName":"R.","lastName":"Korb","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Sch√∂ttl","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T07:43:18Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T07:43:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6XJGLGKB","itemID":1480,"attachments":[{"key":"ZY52I5UD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Korb and Sch√∂ttl - 2018 - Exploring Unstructured Environment with Frontier T.pdf","url":"https://link-springer-com.thi.idm.oclc.org/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-017-0754-8.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-06T07:43:16Z","parentItem":"6XJGLGKB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Korb and Sch√∂ttl - 2018 - Exploring Unstructured Environment with Frontier T.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T07:43:16Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T07:43:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ZY52I5UD","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/ZY52I5UD/Korb and Sch√∂ttl - 2018 - Exploring Unstructured Environment with Frontier T.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1479/Korb and Sch√∂ttl - 2018 - Exploring Unstructured Environment with Frontier T.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762221,"version":0},"$loki":946},{"itemID":403,"item":{"key":"6YBYRHMX","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhancement","abstractNote":"Retinex model is an effective tool for low-light image enhancement. It assumes that observed images can be decomposed into the reflectance and illumination. Most existing Retinex-based methods have carefully designed hand-crafted constraints and parameters for this highly ill-posed decomposition, which may be limited by model capacity when applied in various scenes. In this paper, we collect a LOw-Light dataset (LOL) containing low/normal-light image pairs and propose a deep Retinex-Net learned on this dataset, including a Decom-Net for decomposition and an Enhance-Net for illumination adjustment. In the training process for Decom-Net, there is no ground truth of decomposed reflectance and illumination. The network is learned with only key constraints including the consistent reflectance shared by paired low/normal-light images, and the smoothness of illumination. Based on the decomposition, subsequent lightness enhancement is conducted on illumination by an enhancement network called Enhance-Net, and for joint denoising there is a denoising operation on reflectance. The Retinex-Net is end-to-end trainable, so that the learned decomposition is by nature good for lightness adjustment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves visually pleasing quality for low-light enhancement but also provides a good representation of image decomposition.","date":"2018-08-14","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04560","accessDate":"2022-05-02T16:33:42Z","extra":"arXiv: 1808.04560","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1808.04560 [cs]","creators":[{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wei","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenhan","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jiaying","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T16:33:42Z","dateModified":"2022-06-07T14:51:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6YBYRHMX","itemID":403,"attachments":[{"key":"H35Z9GGD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04560.pdf","accessDate":"2022-05-02T16:33:51Z","parentItem":"6YBYRHMX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wei et al. - 2018 - Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhanceme.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T16:33:51Z","dateModified":"2022-05-02T16:33:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/H35Z9GGD","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/H35Z9GGD/Wei et al. - 2018 - Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhanceme.pdf","defaultPath":"files/405/Wei et al. - 2018 - Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhanceme.pdf"},{"key":"N3IQFJ86","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04560","accessDate":"2022-05-02T16:33:55Z","parentItem":"6YBYRHMX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1808.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T16:33:55Z","dateModified":"2022-05-02T16:33:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/N3IQFJ86","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/N3IQFJ86/1808.html","defaultPath":"files/406/1808.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"EIU8I9KS","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"6YBYRHMX","note":"Comment: BMVC 2018(Oral).

Math., in press], of the following problem, which arises in robotics: Given a collection of bodies B, which may be hinged, i.e., may allow internal motion around various joints, and given a region bounded by a collection of polyhedral or other simple walls, decide whether or not there exists a continuous motion connecting two given positions and orientations of the whole collection of bodies. We show that this problem can be handled by appropriate refinements of methods introduced by A. Tarski [‚ÄúA Decision Method for Elementary Algebra and Geometry,‚Äù 2nd ed., Univ. of Calif. Press, Berkeley, 1951] and G. Collins [in ‚ÄúSecond GI Conference on Automata Theory and Formal Languages,‚Äù Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 33, pp. 134‚Äì183, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1975], which lead to algorithms for this problem which are polynomial in the geometric complexity of the problem for each fixed number of degrees of freedom (but exponential in the number of degrees of freedom). Our method, which is also related to a technique outlined by J. Reif [in ‚ÄúProceedings, 20th Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science,‚Äù pp. 421‚Äì427, 1979], also gives a general (but not polynomial time) procedure for calculating all of the homology groups of an arbitrary real algebraic variety. Various algorithmic issues concerning computations with algebraic numbers, which are required in the algorithms presented in this paper, are also reviewed.","date":"1983-09-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0196885883900143","accessDate":"2022-08-25T13:40:03Z","volume":"4","pages":"298-351","publicationTitle":"Advances in Applied Mathematics","DOI":"10.1016/0196-8858(83)90014-3","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Advances in Applied Mathematics","ISSN":"0196-8858","creators":[{"firstName":"Jacob T","lastName":"Schwartz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Micha","lastName":"Sharir","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5WDEKDDF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-25T13:40:03Z","dateModified":"2022-08-25T13:40:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/74GZTGTT","itemID":1311,"attachments":[{"key":"BS5ZX258","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Full Text PDF","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0196885883900143/pdf?md5=7071d4b0b16d3d093ed1448aa03b95f8&pid=1-s2.0-0196885883900143-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y","accessDate":"2022-08-25T13:40:05Z","parentItem":"74GZTGTT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Schwartz and Sharir - 1983 - On the ‚Äúpiano movers‚Äù problem.

Abstraction has been mainly studied in problem solving, theorem proving, knowledge representation (in particular for spatial and temporal reasoning) and machine learning. In such contexts, abstraction is defined as a mapping between formalisms that reduces the computational complexity of the task at stake. By analysing the notion of abstraction from an information quantity point of view, we pinpoint the differences and the complementary role of reformulation and abstraction in any representation change. We contribute to extending the existing semantic theories of abstraction to be grounded on perception, where the notion of information quantity is easier to characterize formally. In the author's view, abstraction is best represented using abstraction operators, as they provide semantics for classifying different abstractions and support the automation of representation changes. The usefulness of a grounded theory of abstraction in the cartography domain is illustrated. Finally, the importance of explicitly representing abstraction for designing more autonomous and adaptive systems is discussed.","date":"2003-7-29","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693211/","accessDate":"2022-10-19T09:51:26Z","extra":"PMID: 12903672\nPMCID: PMC1693211","volume":"358","pages":"1293-1309","publicationTitle":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","issue":"1435","journalAbbreviation":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","ISSN":"0962-8436","creators":[{"firstName":"Jean-Daniel","lastName":"Zucker","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5WDEKDDF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-19T09:51:26Z","dateModified":"2022-10-19T09:51:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/77SZ56NI","itemID":1541,"attachments":[{"key":"9Z6CREGQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PubMed Central Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693211/pdf/12903672.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-19T09:51:28Z","parentItem":"77SZ56NI","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zucker - 2003 - A grounded theory of abstraction in artificial int.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-19T09:51:28Z","dateModified":"2022-10-19T09:51:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9Z6CREGQ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/9Z6CREGQ/Zucker - 2003 - A grounded theory of abstraction in artificial int.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1543/Zucker - 2003 - A grounded theory of abstraction in artificial int.pdf"},{"key":"RKNNPZYX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PubMed Central Link","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693211/","accessDate":"2022-10-19T09:51:26Z","parentItem":"77SZ56NI","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-19T09:51:26Z","dateModified":"2022-10-19T09:51:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/RKNNPZYX"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762223,"version":0},"$loki":949},{"itemID":141,"item":{"key":"794AMQCV","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A survey on vision-based UAV navigation","abstractNote":"Research on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been increasingly popular in the past decades, and UAVs have been widely used in industrial inspection, remote sensing for mapping & surveying, rescuing, and so on.

Previously, researchers mainly focused on the use of laser or radar sensors for UAV navigation. With the rapid development of computer vision, vision-based methods, which utilize cheaper and more flexible visual sensors, have shown great advantages in the field of UAV navigation. The purpose of this article is to present a comprehensive literature review of the vision-based methods for UAV navigation. Specifically on visual localization and mapping, obstacle avoidance and path planning, which compose the essential parts of visual navigation. Furthermore, throughout this article, we will have an insight into the prospect of the UAV navigation and the challenges to be faced.","date":"2018-01-02","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2017.1420509","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:47:20Z","extra":"Publisher: Taylor & Francis\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2017.1420509","volume":"21","pages":"21-32","publicationTitle":"Geo-spatial Information Science","DOI":"10.1080/10095020.2017.1420509","issue":"1","ISSN":"1009-5020","creators":[{"firstName":"Yuncheng","lastName":"Lu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhucun","lastName":"Xue","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gui-Song","lastName":"Xia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Liangpei","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"path planning","type":1},{"tag":"obstacle avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","type":1},{"tag":"visual SLAM","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:47:20Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:47:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/794AMQCV","itemID":141,"attachments":[{"key":"MF6SGULS","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10095020.2017.1420509","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:47:22Z","parentItem":"794AMQCV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lu et al. - 2018 - A survey on vision-based UAV navigation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:47:22Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:47:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MF6SGULS","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/MF6SGULS/Lu et al. - 2018 - A survey on vision-based UAV navigation.pdf","defaultPath":"files/142/Lu et al. - 2018 - A survey on vision-based UAV navigation.pdf"},{"key":"SMAWXAVP","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10095020.2017.1420509","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:47:28Z","parentItem":"794AMQCV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"10095020.2017.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:47:28Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:47:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SMAWXAVP","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SMAWXAVP/10095020.2017.html","defaultPath":"files/143/10095020.2017.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762224,"version":0},"$loki":950},{"itemID":1000,"item":{"key":"7BFVCNT2","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Incremental A*","abstractNote":"Incremental search techniques Ô¨Ånd optimal solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster than is possible by solving each search task from scratch.

The core idea is to encode the local topology of a graph, via convolutions, into the feature of a center node. In this paper, we propose a novel GCN model, which we term as Shortest Path Graph Attention Network (SPAGAN). Unlike conventional GCN models that carry out node-based attentions within each layer, the proposed SPAGAN conducts path-based attention that explicitly accounts for the inÔ¨Çuence of a sequence of nodes yielding the minimum cost, or shortest path, between the center node and its higher-order neighbors. SPAGAN therefore allows for a more informative and intact exploration of the graph structure and further a more effective aggregation of information from distant neighbors into the center node, as compared to node-based GCN methods. We test SPAGAN on the downstream classiÔ¨Åcation task on several standard datasets, and achieve performances superior to the state of the art.","date":"8/2019","language":"en","shortTitle":"SPAGAN","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/569","accessDate":"2022-06-27T12:59:36Z","place":"Macao, China","publisher":"International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization","ISBN":"978-0-9992411-4-1","pages":"4099-4105","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence","conferenceName":"Twenty-Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence {IJCAI-19}","DOI":"10.24963/ijcai.2019/569","creators":[{"firstName":"Yiding","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinchao","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mingli","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Junsong","lastName":"Yuan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Tao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-27T12:59:36Z","dateModified":"2022-06-27T12:59:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7HPGGC39","itemID":919,"attachments":[{"key":"3RH6B7L9","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Yang et al. - 2019 - SPAGAN Shortest Path Graph Attention Network.pdf","url":"https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0569.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-27T12:59:34Z","parentItem":"7HPGGC39","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yang et al. - 2019 - SPAGAN Shortest Path Graph Attention Network.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-27T12:59:34Z","dateModified":"2022-06-27T12:59:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/3RH6B7L9","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/3RH6B7L9/Yang et al. - 2019 - SPAGAN Shortest Path Graph Attention Network.pdf","defaultPath":"files/918/Yang et al. - 2019 - SPAGAN Shortest Path Graph Attention Network.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762226,"version":0},"$loki":952},{"itemID":503,"item":{"key":"7LJM5EER","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Deadlock Prediction and Recovery for Distributed Collision Avoidance with Buffered Voronoi Cells","abstractNote":"This paper introduces a distributed multi-robot collision avoidance algorithm based on the concept of Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVC). We propose a novel algorithm for avoiding deadlocks consisting of three stages: deadlock prediction, deadlock recovery, and deadlock recovery success prediction. Simple heuristics (such as the right-hand rule) are often used to avoid deadlocks. Such heuristics might reduce deadlock in simple configurations and sparsely populated environments, but they begin to fail in complex configurations and more densely populated environments. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using an open-source web-based multi-robot simulation. The results show that while the proposed algorithm does not eliminate the occurrence of deadlocks, it drastically reduces their occurrence, and leads to a considerable improvement in performance, especially in high-density environments. We also validate the real-world performance of the proposed algorithm in live experiments.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"429-436","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636609","creators":[{"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Abdullhak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Vardy","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Prediction algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Intelligent robots","type":1},{"tag":"Open source software","type":1},{"tag":"System recovery","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:48:00Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:48:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7LJM5EER","itemID":503,"attachments":[{"key":"S37EL9XU","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636609?arnumber=9636609","accessDate":"2022-05-18T14:48:28Z","parentItem":"7LJM5EER","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9636609.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:48:28Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:48:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/S37EL9XU","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/S37EL9XU/9636609.html","defaultPath":"files/505/9636609.html"},{"key":"3YXFFMZQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9636609&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTYzNjYwOQ==","accessDate":"2022-05-18T14:48:11Z","parentItem":"7LJM5EER","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Abdullhak and Vardy - 2021 - Deadlock Prediction and Recovery for Distributed C.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:48:11Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:48:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/3YXFFMZQ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/3YXFFMZQ/Abdullhak and Vardy - 2021 - Deadlock Prediction and Recovery for Distributed C.pdf","defaultPath":"files/504/Abdullhak and Vardy - 2021 - Deadlock Prediction and Recovery for Distributed C.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762226,"version":0},"$loki":953},{"itemID":539,"item":{"key":"7NFRYIYF","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Offline and Online Search: UAV Multiobjective Path Planning Under Dynamic Urban Environment","abstractNote":"This paper is concerned with path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying through low altitude urban environment. Although many different path planning algorithms have been proposed to find optimal or near-optimal collision-free paths for UAVs, most of them either do not consider dynamic obstacle avoidance or do not incorporate multiple objectives. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective path planning (MOPP) framework to explore a suitable path for a UAV operating in a dynamic urban environment, where safety level is considered in the proposed framework to guarantee the safety of UAV in addition to travel time. To this aim, two types of safety index maps (SIMs) are developed first to capture static obstacles in the geography map and unexpected obstacles that are unavailable in the geography map. Then an MOPP method is proposed by jointly using offline and online search, where the offline search is based on the static SIM and helps shorten the travel time and avoid static obstacles, while the online search is based on the dynamic SIM of unexpected obstacles and helps bypass unexpected obstacles quickly. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework under the dynamic urban environment.","date":"2018-04","shortTitle":"Offline and Online Search","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Internet of Things Journal","volume":"5","pages":"546-558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2717078","issue":"2","ISSN":"2327-4662","creators":[{"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Xiao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Cao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Xi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dapeng","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Safety","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Sensors","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Urban areas","type":1},{"tag":"Low altitude urban environment","type":1},{"tag":"offline and online search","type":1},{"tag":"safety index map (SIM)","type":1},{"tag":"unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:51:42Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:51:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7NFRYIYF","itemID":539,"attachments":[{"key":"UZC2X4PJ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7953494?arnumber=7953494","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:52:13Z","parentItem":"7NFRYIYF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7953494.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:52:13Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:52:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/UZC2X4PJ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/UZC2X4PJ/7953494.html","defaultPath":"files/541/7953494.html"},{"key":"LZWCYWSW","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7953494&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9Nzk1MzQ5NA==","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:51:45Z","parentItem":"7NFRYIYF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yin et al. - 2018 - Offline and Online Search UAV Multiobjective Path.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:51:45Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:51:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/LZWCYWSW","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/LZWCYWSW/Yin et al. - 2018 - Offline and Online Search UAV Multiobjective Path.pdf","defaultPath":"files/540/Yin et al. - 2018 - Offline and Online Search UAV Multiobjective Path.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762228,"version":0},"$loki":954},{"itemID":1521,"item":{"key":"7QQ7S98M","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"DehazeNet: An End-to-End System for Single Image Haze Removal","abstractNote":"Single image haze removal is a challenging ill-posed problem. Existing methods use various constraints/priors to get plausible dehazing solutions. The key to achieve haze removal is to estimate a medium transmission map for an input hazy image. In this paper, we propose a trainable end-to-end system called DehazeNet, for medium transmission estimation. DehazeNet takes a hazy image as input, and outputs its medium transmission map that is subsequently used to recover a haze-free image via atmospheric scattering model. DehazeNet adopts Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based deep architecture, whose layers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors in image dehazing. Specifically, layers of Maxout units are used for feature extraction, which can generate almost all haze-relevant features. We also propose a novel nonlinear activation function in DehazeNet, called Bilateral Rectified Linear Unit (BReLU), which is able to improve the quality of recovered haze-free image. We establish connections between components of the proposed DehazeNet and those used in existing methods.

Motion planning methods for autonomous driving and mobile robots typically need to rely on the spatial constraints imposed by a map-based global planner to generate a collision-free trajectory. These methods may fail without an offline map or where the map is invalid due to dynamic changes in the environment such as road obstruction, construction, and traffic congestion. To address this problem, triangulation-based methods can be used to obtain a spatial constraint. However, the existing methods fall short when dealing with dynamic environments and may lead the motion planner to an unrecoverable state. In this paper, we propose a new method to generate a sequence of channels across different triangulation mesh topologies to serve as the spatial constraints. This can be applied to motion planning of autonomous vehicles or robots in cluttered, unstructured environments. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with other triangulation-based methods in synthetic and complex scenarios collected from a real-world autonomous driving dataset. We have shown that the proposed method results in a more stable, long-term plan with a higher task completion rate, faster arrival time, a higher rate of successful plans, and fewer collisions compared to existing methods.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"384-389","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636067","creators":[{"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Yadmellat","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Roads","type":1},{"tag":"Semantics","type":1},{"tag":"Topology","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:23:55Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:23:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7STL9X8M","itemID":480,"attachments":[{"key":"BUQKSJ27","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636067?arnumber=9636067","accessDate":"2022-05-18T14:24:15Z","parentItem":"7STL9X8M","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9636067.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:24:15Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:24:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BUQKSJ27","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/BUQKSJ27/9636067.html","defaultPath":"files/482/9636067.html"},{"key":"P78CFMFC","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9636067&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTYzNjA2Nw==","accessDate":"2022-05-18T14:23:59Z","parentItem":"7STL9X8M","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hu and Yadmellat - 2021 - Spatial Constraint Generation for Motion Planning .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:23:59Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:23:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/P78CFMFC","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/P78CFMFC/Hu and Yadmellat - 2021 - Spatial Constraint Generation for Motion Planning .pdf","defaultPath":"files/481/Hu and Yadmellat - 2021 - Spatial Constraint Generation for Motion Planning .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762231,"version":0},"$loki":956},{"itemID":41,"item":{"key":"7TX3PX38","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Real-Time Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation for Quadcopters: Algorithm Speed-up Through Machine Learning","abstractNote":"This paper addresses the problem of generating quadcopter minimum snap trajectories for real time applications.

The ideal flight path is expected to balance the total flight path length and the terrain threat, to shorten the flight time and reduce the possibility of collision. However, in the traditional methods, the tradeoff between these concerns is difficult to achieve, and practical constraints are lacking in the optimized objective functions, which leads to inaccurate modeling. In addition, the traditional methods based on gradient optimization lack an accurate optimization capability in the complex multimodal objective space, resulting in a nonoptimal path. Thus, in this article, an accurate UAV 3-D path planning approach in accordance with an enhanced multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed (APPMS). In the APPMS method, the path planning mission is converted into a multiobjective optimization task with multiple constraints, and the objectives based on the total flight path length and degree of terrain threat are simultaneously optimized. In addition, to obtain the optimal UAV 3-D flight path, an accurate swarm intelligence search approach based on improved ant colony optimization is introduced, which can improve the global and local search capabilities by using the preferred search direction and random neighborhood search mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed APPMS method was demonstrated in three groups of simulated experiments with different degrees of terrain threat, and a real-data experiment with 3-D terrain data from an actual emergency situation.","date":"2022","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pages":"1-14","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","DOI":"10.1109/TCYB.2022.3170580","ISSN":"2168-2275","creators":[{"firstName":"Yuting","lastName":"Wan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yanfei","lastName":"Zhong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ailong","lastName":"Ma","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Liangpei","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Linear programming","type":1},{"tag":"Task analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Autonomous aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Particle swarm optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Ant colony optimization (ACO)","type":1},{"tag":"multiobjective optimization","type":1},{"tag":"swarm intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"three-dimensional (3-D) terrain","type":1},{"tag":"unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning.","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-25T13:51:02Z","dateModified":"2022-05-25T13:51:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/84E8BGES","itemID":604,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762238,"version":0},"$loki":961},{"itemID":82,"item":{"key":"852C6WXH","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Review of Physics Simulators for Robotic Applications","abstractNote":"The use of simulators in robotics research is widespread, underpinning the majority of recent advances in the field.

Anytime planners are ideal for these types of problems as they find an initial solution quickly and then improve it as time allows. In this paper, we develop an anytime planner that builds off of Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP), which is a fast A*-variant for planning in dynamic environments that uses intervals instead of timesteps to represent the time dimension of the problem. In addition, we introduce an optional time-horizon after which the planner drops time as a dimension. On the theoretical side, we show that in the absence of time-horizon our planner can provide guarantees on completeness as well as bounds on the sub-optimality of the solution with respect to the original space-time graph. We also provide simulation experiments for planning for a UAV among 50 dynamic obstacles, where we can provide safe paths for the next 15 seconds of execution within 0.05 seconds. Our results provide a strong evidence for our planner working under real-time constraints.","date":"2012-10","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"4708-4715","proceedingsTitle":"2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","conferenceName":"2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","DOI":"10.1109/IROS.2012.6386191","creators":[{"firstName":"Venkatraman","lastName":"Narayanan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Phillips","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1}],"collections":["PR9LQ92F"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-28T06:28:09Z","dateModified":"2022-10-28T06:28:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/87W24TND","itemID":1548,"attachments":[{"key":"NKVYJXXS","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386191?arnumber=6386191","accessDate":"2022-10-28T06:28:22Z","parentItem":"87W24TND","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"6386191.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-28T06:28:22Z","dateModified":"2022-10-28T06:28:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NKVYJXXS","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/NKVYJXXS/6386191.html","defaultPath":"files/1550/6386191.html"},{"key":"8GJPXA34","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6386191&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NjM4NjE5MQ==","accessDate":"2022-10-28T06:28:12Z","parentItem":"87W24TND","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Narayanan et al. - 2012 - Anytime Safe Interval Path Planning for dynamic en.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-28T06:28:12Z","dateModified":"2022-10-28T06:28:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8GJPXA34","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8GJPXA34/Narayanan et al. - 2012 - Anytime Safe Interval Path Planning for dynamic en.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1549/Narayanan et al. - 2012 - Anytime Safe Interval Path Planning for dynamic en.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762240,"version":0},"$loki":963},{"itemID":1058,"item":{"key":"8885ZXI2","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A survey of autonomous mobile robot path planning approaches","abstractNote":"Navigation is one of the pivotal and defining features of an autonomous robot.

Many risk-aware path planners have been developed to explicitly limit the probability of collision to an acceptable bound in uncertain environments. However, convex obstacles or Gaussian uncertainties are usually assumed to make the problem tractable in the existing method. These assumptions limit the generalization and application of path planners in real-world implementations. In this article, we propose to apply deep learning methods to the sampling-based planner, developing a novel risk bounded near-optimal path planning algorithm named neural risk-aware RRT (NR-RRT). Specifically, a deterministic risk contours map is maintained by perceiving the probabilistic nonconvex obstacles, and a neural network sampler is proposed to predict the next most-promising safe state. Furthermore, the recursive divide-and-conquer planning and bidirectional search strategies are used to accelerate the convergence to a near-optimal solution with guaranteed bounded risk. Worst-case theoretical guarantees can also be proven owing to a standby safety guaranteed planner utilizing a uniform sampling distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art remarkably for finding risk bounded low-cost paths in seen and unseen environments with uncertainty and nonconvex constraints.","date":"2022-05-13","shortTitle":"NR-RRT","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06951","accessDate":"2022-07-28T15:54:39Z","extra":"arXiv:2205.06951 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2205.06951","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:2205.06951","creators":[{"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Meng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Liangliang","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Ma","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jiankun","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Max Q.-H.","lastName":"Meng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1}],"collections":["YE9SY9RF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T15:54:39Z","dateModified":"2022-07-28T15:54:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8G7RFHMC","itemID":1038,"attachments":[{"key":"T39LGNQE","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06951.pdf","accessDate":"2022-07-28T15:54:47Z","parentItem":"8G7RFHMC","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Meng et al. - 2022 - NR-RRT Neural Risk-Aware Near-Optimal Path Planni.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T15:54:47Z","dateModified":"2022-07-28T15:54:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/T39LGNQE","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/T39LGNQE/Meng et al. - 2022 - NR-RRT Neural Risk-Aware Near-Optimal Path Planni.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1039/Meng et al. - 2022 - NR-RRT Neural Risk-Aware Near-Optimal Path Planni.pdf"},{"key":"64XQXI9Q","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06951","accessDate":"2022-07-28T15:54:52Z","parentItem":"8G7RFHMC","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2205.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T15:54:52Z","dateModified":"2022-07-28T15:54:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/64XQXI9Q","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/64XQXI9Q/2205.html","defaultPath":"files/1040/2205.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762245,"version":0},"$loki":968},{"itemID":1354,"item":{"key":"8HFFZTKX","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"RRT-Connect: An EÔ¨Écient Approach to Single-Query Path Planning","abstractNote":"A simple and eÔ¨Écient randomized algorithm is presented for solving single-query path planning problems in high-dimensional conÔ¨Åguration spaces.

The paper presents application and implementation of Firefly Algorithm (FA) for Mobile Robot Navigation (MRN) in uncertain environment. The uncertainty is defined over the changing environmental condition from static to dynamic. The attraction of one firefly towards the other firefly due to variation of their brightness is the key concept of the proposed study. The proposed controller efficiently explores the environment and improves the global search in less number of iterations and hence it can be easily implemented for real time obstacle avoidance especially for dynamic environment. It solves the challenges of navigation, minimizes the computational calculations, and avoids random moving of fireflies. The performance of proposed controller is better in terms of path optimality when compared to other intelligent navigational approaches.","date":"2018-12-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914718300333","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:53:43Z","volume":"14","pages":"691-701","publicationTitle":"Defence Technology","DOI":"10.1016/j.dt.2018.06.004","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"Defence Technology","ISSN":"2214-9147","creators":[{"firstName":"B.

A multilevel framework is proposed that provides a solution for UAM in the non-segregated airspace. The proposed method takes advantage of a prediction-based zone partitioning algorithm that minimizes high-density traffic encounters. Numerical potential fields are used for global path planning as they provide optimum standoff clearance from obstacles and high-density traffic present in the environment. In the event of low-density traffic, a simple but effective octant-based local collision avoidance strategy is used.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"1010-1019","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476791","creators":[{"firstName":"Sajid Ahamed","lastName":"M A","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Satya Prakash","lastName":"K","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shuvrangshu","lastName":"Jana","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Debasish","lastName":"Ghose","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Simulation","type":1},{"tag":"Prediction algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Urban areas","type":1},{"tag":"Partitioning algorithms","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:25:49Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:25:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8Q66YKEM","itemID":266,"attachments":[{"key":"IATKU4AT","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476791/?arnumber=9476791","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:26:03Z","parentItem":"8Q66YKEM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476791.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:26:03Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:26:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IATKU4AT","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/IATKU4AT/9476791.html","defaultPath":"files/268/9476791.html"},{"key":"K7CH9W8I","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476791&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3Njc5MQ==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:25:54Z","parentItem":"8Q66YKEM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"M A et al. - 2021 - UAS Flight Path Planning using Numerical Potential.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:25:54Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:25:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/K7CH9W8I","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/K7CH9W8I/M A et al. - 2021 - UAS Flight Path Planning using Numerical Potential.pdf","defaultPath":"files/267/M A et al. - 2021 - UAS Flight Path Planning using Numerical Potential.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762252,"version":0},"$loki":976},{"itemID":116,"item":{"key":"8QNVHDIC","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"Recent Developments in Path Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","abstractNote":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in performing diverse missions at significantly lower costs compared to the human beings.

A recent surge of interest in this field brought advances that yield good performance in tasks ranging from arcade games to continuous control; these methods however do not come without significant issues, such as limited generalization capabilities and difficulties when dealing with combinatorially hard planning instances. Our contribution is two-fold: (i) we present a method that learns to represent its environment as a latent graph and leverages state reidentification to reduce the complexity of finding a good policy from exponential to linear (ii) we introduce a set of lightweight environments with an underlying discrete combinatorial structure in which planning is challenging even for humans.

In this paper, we show that several interesting planning domains possess compact generalized heuristics that can guide a greedy search in guaranteed polynomial time to the goal, and which work for any instance of the domain. These heuristics are weighted sums of state features that capture the number of objects satisfying a certain Ô¨Årst-order logic property in any given state. These features have a meaningful interpretation and generalize naturally to the whole domain. Additionally, we present an approach based on mixed integer linear programming to compute such heuristics automatically from the observation of small training instances.

We consider two-dimensional configuration spaces. At any point in time, the robots' map consists of known, partially-mapped obstacles. The unknown, yet-to-be-explored area is mapped to a single point, thus giving us a quotient space. The topological classes on the quotient space allows us to define topological classes of trajectories connecting a robot pose to the unknown region in the original configuration space. Robots explore this configuration space choosing different homology classes when confronted by obstacles or walls. We illustrate the basic idea with simulations of small teams of robots. Experiments with a single robot illustrate the applicability of the method to robots that have small sensor footprints and limited computational resources.

In a cluttered environment, the cables can wrap around obstacles, but careful choice needs to be made for the initial cable configurations to ensure that the workspace of the robot is optimized. The presence of cables makes it imperative to consider the homotopy classes of the cables both in the design and motion planning problems. In this letter, we study the problem of workspace planning for multiple-cable controlled robots in an environment with polygonal obstacles. This letter's goal is to establish a relationship between the boundary of the workspace and cable configurations of such robots and solve related optimization and motion planning problems. We first analyze the conditions under which a configuration of a cable-controlled robot can be considered valid, discuss the relationship between cable configuration, the robot's workspace and its motion state, and using graph search based motion planning in h-augmented graph perform workspace optimization and compute optimal paths for the robot. We demonstrated the algorithms in simulations.","date":"2018-07","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","volume":"3","pages":"2600-2607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LRA.2018.2817684","issue":"3","ISSN":"2377-3766","creators":[{"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Robot sensing systems","type":1},{"tag":"collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Service robots","type":1},{"tag":"Motion and path planning","type":1},{"tag":"industrial robots","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T11:18:58Z","dateModified":"2022-09-16T11:18:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9PNACMFY","itemID":1425,"attachments":[{"key":"QK27222L","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8320807&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50LzgzMjA4MDc=","accessDate":"2022-09-16T11:19:00Z","parentItem":"9PNACMFY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang and Bhattacharya - 2018 - A Topological Approach to Workspace and Motion Pla.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T11:19:00Z","dateModified":"2022-09-16T11:19:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QK27222L","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/QK27222L/Wang and Bhattacharya - 2018 - A Topological Approach to Workspace and Motion Pla.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1426/Wang and Bhattacharya - 2018 - A Topological Approach to Workspace and Motion Pla.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762258,"version":0},"$loki":986},{"itemID":1403,"item":{"key":"9TRBRFWI","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"Computational topology: an introduction","date":"2010","shortTitle":"Computational topology","libraryCatalog":"Library of Congress ISBN","callNumber":"QA611 .E353 2010","extra":"OCLC: ocn427757156","place":"Providence, R.I","publisher":"American Mathematical Society","ISBN":"978-0-8218-4925-5","numPages":"241","creators":[{"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Edelsbrunner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Harer","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computational complexity","type":1},{"tag":"Topology","type":1},{"tag":"Algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Data processing","type":1},{"tag":"Geometry","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-15T13:38:25Z","dateModified":"2022-09-15T13:38:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9TRBRFWI","itemID":1403,"attachments":[{"key":"Z2VG2UG4","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Edelsbrunner and Harer - 2010 - Computational topology an introduction.pdf","parentItem":"9TRBRFWI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Edelsbrunner and Harer - 2010 - Computational topology an introduction.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-15T13:38:37Z","dateModified":"2022-09-15T13:38:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Z2VG2UG4","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/Z2VG2UG4/Edelsbrunner and Harer - 2010 - Computational topology an introduction.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1404/Edelsbrunner and Harer - 2010 - Computational topology an introduction.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762260,"version":0},"$loki":987},{"itemID":233,"item":{"key":"9TXE2N62","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Fast and Effective Identification of Window and Door Openings for UAVs' Indoor Navigation","abstractNote":"As one of today's popular research field, autonomous unmanned systems are widely used in entertainment, search and rescue, health, military, agriculture and many other fields with the advantages of technological developments. Object detection is one of the methods used for autonomous vehicles to gather and report information about its environment during mission. With the ability to detect and classify objects, an unmanned vehicle can determine the type and number of objects around it and use this information in its autonomous motion and path planning or reporting the objects with the desired features. In an indoor environment, the data coming from an optic sensor provides enough capability to detect crossing points for an intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle such as doors, windows and stairs. However, sliding objects like windows and doors need to be classified as open or closed if this information will be used for path planning. Moreover, the crossing point's width needs to be calculated to ensure it is safe to go through it. So as to provide a robust navigation plan, LIDAR sensor data can be used to ensure object classification. In this study, a method to fuse LIDAR and optic sensors data has been developed and by the way a stronger object detection method is created. A crossing point is classified as an open/closed and determined whether to have enough space or not to pass through. This method was operated in a developer board mountable in a flying quadrotor which makes it possible to use it in a real-time scenario. The success of the approach has been shown with different scenarios.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"175-181","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476840","creators":[{"firstName":"Onder","lastName":"Alparslan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Cetin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Real-time systems","type":1},{"tag":"Three-dimensional displays","type":1},{"tag":"deep learning","type":1},{"tag":"Cameras","type":1},{"tag":"Laser radar","type":1},{"tag":"Autonomous unmanned systems","type":1},{"tag":"data fusion","type":1},{"tag":"object classification","type":1},{"tag":"Stairs","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:00:28Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:00:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9TXE2N62","itemID":233,"attachments":[{"key":"QIYLRQWM","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476840/?arnumber=9476840","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:00:36Z","parentItem":"9TXE2N62","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476840.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:00:36Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:00:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QIYLRQWM","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/QIYLRQWM/9476840.html","defaultPath":"files/235/9476840.html"},{"key":"PZ7D5TK8","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476840&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3Njg0MA==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:00:29Z","parentItem":"9TXE2N62","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alparslan and Cetin - 2021 - Fast and Effective Identification of Window and Do.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:00:29Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:00:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PZ7D5TK8","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/PZ7D5TK8/Alparslan and Cetin - 2021 - Fast and Effective Identification of Window and Do.pdf","defaultPath":"files/234/Alparslan and Cetin - 2021 - Fast and Effective Identification of Window and Do.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762261,"version":0},"$loki":988},{"itemID":1470,"item":{"key":"9W4W8TCM","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"$k$-Survivability: Diversity and Survival of Expendable Robots","abstractNote":"We define the k-survivability of a set of n paths as the probability that at least k out of n robots following those paths through a stochastic threat environment reach goals.

We design two algorithms: a complete algorithm that finds an optimal list of paths, and a heuristic method that finds paths with high k-survivability.

Removing snow from images thus is an important topic in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a Deep Dense Multi-Scale Network (DDMSNet) for snow removal by exploiting semantic and geometric priors. As images captured in outdoor often share similar scenes and their visibility varies with depth from camera, such semantic and geometric information provides a strong prior for snowy image restoration. We incorporate the semantic and geometric maps as input and learn the semantic-aware and geometry-aware representation to remove snow. In particular, we Ô¨Årst create a coarse network to remove snow from the input images. Then, the coarsely desnowed images are fed into another network to obtain the semantic and geometric labels. Finally, we design a DDMSNet to learn semantic-aware and geometry-aware representation via a self-attention mechanism to produce the Ô¨Ånal clean images. Experiments evaluated on public synthetic and real-world snowy images verify the superiority of the proposed method, offering better results both quantitatively and qualitatively.","date":"2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11298","accessDate":"2022-10-14T09:31:55Z","extra":"arXiv:2103.11298 [cs]","volume":"30","pages":"7419-7431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","DOI":"10.1109/TIP.2021.3104166","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans. on Image Process.","ISSN":"1057-7149, 1941-0042","creators":[{"firstName":"Kaihao","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rongqing","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yanjiang","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenhan","lastName":"Luo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Changsheng","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hongdong","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-14T09:31:55Z","dateModified":"2022-10-14T09:31:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9YEF6Q94","itemID":1511,"attachments":[{"key":"RDFXNQDD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zhang et al. - 2021 - Deep Dense Multi-scale Network for Snow Removal Us.pdf","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11298.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-14T09:31:46Z","parentItem":"9YEF6Q94","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang et al. - 2021 - Deep Dense Multi-scale Network for Snow Removal Us.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-14T09:31:46Z","dateModified":"2022-10-14T09:31:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/RDFXNQDD","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/RDFXNQDD/Zhang et al. - 2021 - Deep Dense Multi-scale Network for Snow Removal Us.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1510/Zhang et al. - 2021 - Deep Dense Multi-scale Network for Snow Removal Us.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762262,"version":0},"$loki":990},{"itemID":905,"item":{"key":"A5HBGRIU","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A Uniform Abstraction Framework for Generalized Planning","abstractNote":"Generalized planning aims at Ô¨Ånding a general solution for a set of similar planning problems. Abstractions are widely used to solve such problems. However, the connections among these abstraction works remain vague. Thus, to facilitate a deep understanding and further exploration of abstraction approaches for generalized planning, it is important to develop a uniform abstraction framework for generalized planning. Recently, Banihashemi et al. proposed an agent abstraction framework based on the situation calculus. However, expressiveness of such an abstraction framework is limited. In this paper, by extending their abstraction framework, we propose a uniform abstraction framework for generalized planning. We formalize a generalized planning problem as a triple of a basic action theory, a trajectory constraint, and a goal. Then we deÔ¨Åne the concepts of sound abstractions of a generalized planning problem. We show that solutions to a generalized planning problem are nicely related to those of its sound abstractions. We also deÔ¨Åne and analyze the dual notion of complete abstractions. Finally, we review some important abstraction works for generalized planning and show that they can be formalized in our framework.","date":"8/2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/253","accessDate":"2022-06-27T12:49:21Z","place":"Montreal, Canada","publisher":"International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization","ISBN":"978-0-9992411-9-6","pages":"1837-1844","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the Thirtieth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence","conferenceName":"Thirtieth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence {IJCAI-21}","DOI":"10.24963/ijcai.2021/253","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhenhe","lastName":"Cui","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yongmei","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kailun","lastName":"Luo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-27T12:49:21Z","dateModified":"2022-06-27T12:49:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/A5HBGRIU","itemID":905,"attachments":[{"key":"TMIXQ73T","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Cui et al. - 2021 - A Uniform Abstraction Framework for Generalized Pl.pdf","url":"https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0253.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-27T12:49:19Z","parentItem":"A5HBGRIU","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cui et al. - 2021 - A Uniform Abstraction Framework for Generalized Pl.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-27T12:49:19Z","dateModified":"2022-06-27T12:49:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TMIXQ73T","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/TMIXQ73T/Cui et al. - 2021 - A Uniform Abstraction Framework for Generalized Pl.pdf","defaultPath":"files/904/Cui et al. - 2021 - A Uniform Abstraction Framework for Generalized Pl.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762263,"version":0},"$loki":991},{"itemID":589,"item":{"key":"AS9MN55I","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Quality-Oriented Hybrid Path Planning Based on A* and Q-Learning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","abstractNote":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly important role in people‚Äôs daily lives due to their low cost of operation, low requirements for ground support, high maneuverability, high environmental adaptability, and high safety. Yet UAV path planning under various safety risks, such as crash and collision, is not an easy task, due to the complicated and dynamic nature of path environments. Therefore, developing an efficient and flexible algorithm for UAV path planning has become inevitable. Aimed at quality-oriented UAV path planning, this paper is designed to analyze UAV path planning from two aspects: global static planning and local dynamic hierarchical planning. Through a theoretical and mathematical approach, a three-dimensional UAV path planning model was established. Based on the A* algorithm, the search strategy, the step size, and the cost function were improved, and the OPEN set was simplified, thereby shortening the planning time and greatly improving the execution efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, a dynamic exploration factor was added to the exploration mechanism of Q-learning to solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma of Q-learning to adapt to the local dynamic path adjustment for UAVs. The global-local hybrid UAV path planning algorithm was formed by combining the two. The simulation results indicate that the proposed planning model and algorithm can efficiently solve the problem of UAV path planning, improve the path quality, and can be a significant reference for solving other problems related to path planning, such as the reliability, security, and safety of UAV, when embedded into the heuristic function of the proposed algorithm.","date":"2022","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Access","volume":"10","pages":"7664-7674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139534","ISSN":"2169-3536","creators":[{"firstName":"Dongcheng","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wangping","lastName":"Yin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"W.

In this article, we address the problem of autonomous UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments by formulating it as a Markov decision process with sparse rewards and propose an algorithm named deep reinforcement learning (RL) with nonexpert helpers (LwH). In contrast to prior RL-based methods that put huge efforts into reward shaping, we adopt the sparse reward scheme, i.e., a UAV will be rewarded if and only if it completes navigation tasks. Using the sparse reward scheme ensures that the solution is not biased toward potentially suboptimal directions. However, having no intermediate rewards hinders the agent from efficient learning since informative states are rarely encountered. To handle the challenge, we assume that a prior policy (nonexpert helper) that might be of poor performance is available to the learning agent. The prior policy plays the role of guiding the agent in exploring the state space by reshaping the behavior policy used for environmental interaction. It also assists the agent in achieving goals by setting dynamic learning objectives with increasing difficulty. To evaluate our proposed method, we construct a simulator for UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments and compare our algorithm with several baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that LwH significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms handling sparse rewards and yields impressive navigation policies comparable to those learned in the environment with dense rewards.","date":"2020-07","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Internet of Things Journal","volume":"7","pages":"6180-6190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2020.2973193","issue":"7","ISSN":"2327-4662","creators":[{"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Task analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Reinforcement learning","type":1},{"tag":"Space exploration","type":1},{"tag":"Deep reinforcement learning (RL)","type":1},{"tag":"Internet of Things","type":1},{"tag":"prior information","type":1},{"tag":"sparse reward","type":1},{"tag":"unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:13:36Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:13:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ASSKZW4Y","itemID":575,"attachments":[{"key":"SZIWRGMH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8993742?arnumber=8993742","accessDate":"2022-05-24T11:13:49Z","parentItem":"ASSKZW4Y","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8993742.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:13:49Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:13:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SZIWRGMH","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SZIWRGMH/8993742.html","defaultPath":"files/577/8993742.html"},{"key":"K6RPXP4D","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8993742&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9ODk5Mzc0Mg==","accessDate":"2022-05-24T11:13:39Z","parentItem":"ASSKZW4Y","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2020 - Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Autonomous UAV N.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:13:39Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:13:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/K6RPXP4D","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/K6RPXP4D/Wang et al. - 2020 - Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Autonomous UAV N.pdf","defaultPath":"files/576/Wang et al. - 2020 - Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Autonomous UAV N.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762281,"version":0},"$loki":993},{"itemID":847,"item":{"key":"AUZRLK7Q","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Optimization Methods Applied to Motion Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A Review","abstractNote":"A system that can fly off and touches down to execute particular tasks is a flying robot.

The corridor cross-section is optimized for minimizing the corridor width for the required number of parallel paths while taking into account the downwash effects. Corridor planning utilizes a modified A* algorithm for waypoint generation in conjunction with a logistic curve based path for smoothly connecting these waypoints while accounting for curvature limits of individual paths. Waypoint heading angles are optimized to find minimum length corridor.

This article comprehensively analysis the path search algorithm and trajectory optimization method for UAVs in a three-dimensional environment, classifies them and compares them for each category, analyses the advantages and disadvantages of these methods.","date":"2021-01","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"368-371","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Information Engineering (ECIE)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Information Engineering (ECIE)","DOI":"10.1109/ECIE52353.2021.00081","creators":[{"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fuchun","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Lu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yixu","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"path planning","type":1},{"tag":"UAV","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Real-time systems","type":1},{"tag":"Classification algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Three-dimensional displays","type":1},{"tag":"Kinematics","type":1},{"tag":"path search algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"trajectory optimization method","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-23T12:30:36Z","dateModified":"2022-06-23T12:30:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/B78MH728","itemID":828,"attachments":[{"key":"SLWJUGLB","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9403694?arnumber=9403694","accessDate":"2022-06-23T12:30:44Z","parentItem":"B78MH728","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9403694.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-23T12:30:44Z","dateModified":"2022-06-23T12:30:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SLWJUGLB","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SLWJUGLB/9403694.html","defaultPath":"files/830/9403694.html"},{"key":"HS6RG3V4","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9403694&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQwMzY5NA==","accessDate":"2022-06-23T12:30:37Z","parentItem":"B78MH728","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yu et al. - 2021 - Overview of Research on 3D Path Planning Methods f.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-23T12:30:37Z","dateModified":"2022-06-23T12:30:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/HS6RG3V4","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HS6RG3V4/Yu et al. - 2021 - Overview of Research on 3D Path Planning Methods f.pdf","defaultPath":"files/829/Yu et al. - 2021 - Overview of Research on 3D Path Planning Methods f.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762285,"version":0},"$loki":997},{"itemID":997,"item":{"key":"B845HCEN","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"D* Lite","abstractNote":"Incremental heuristic search methods use heuristics to focus their search and reuse information from previous searches to find solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster than is possible by solving each search task from scratch.

However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.","date":"2011-05-05","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1186","accessDate":"2022-06-10T08:34:24Z","extra":"DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.1105.1186\narXiv:1105.1186 [cs]\ntype: article","reportNumber":"arXiv:1105.1186","institution":"arXiv","creators":[{"firstName":"Sertac","lastName":"Karaman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Frazzoli","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1}],"collections":["MKUGZUF7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-10T08:34:24Z","dateModified":"2022-06-10T08:34:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BCLUN66R","itemID":799,"attachments":[{"key":"QGGUUM8Q","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.1186.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-10T08:34:41Z","parentItem":"BCLUN66R","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Karaman and Frazzoli - 2011 - Sampling-based Algorithms for Optimal Motion Plann.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-10T08:34:41Z","dateModified":"2022-06-10T08:34:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QGGUUM8Q","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/QGGUUM8Q/Karaman and Frazzoli - 2011 - Sampling-based Algorithms for Optimal Motion Plann.pdf","defaultPath":"files/801/Karaman and Frazzoli - 2011 - Sampling-based Algorithms for Optimal Motion Plann.pdf"},{"key":"VQDZ3V8K","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1186","accessDate":"2022-06-10T08:34:46Z","parentItem":"BCLUN66R","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1105.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-10T08:34:46Z","dateModified":"2022-06-10T08:34:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VQDZ3V8K","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/VQDZ3V8K/1105.html","defaultPath":"files/802/1105.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"Z2WTMYL3","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"BCLUN66R","note":"Comment: 76 pages, 26 figures, to appear in International Journal of Robotics Research","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-10T08:34:24Z","dateModified":"2022-06-10T08:34:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Z2WTMYL3"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762287,"version":0},"$loki":999},{"itemID":1506,"item":{"key":"BFK3DGWN","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Deep Joint Rain Detection and Removal from a Single Image","abstractNote":"In this paper, we address a rain removal problem from a single image, even in the presence of heavy rain and rain streak accumulation. Our core ideas lie in our new rain image model and new deep learning architecture. We add a binary map that provides rain streak locations to an existing model, which comprises a rain streak layer and a background layer. We create a model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method, a new contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual information and to produce better representations for rain detection. The evaluation on real images, particularly on heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our models and architecture.","date":"2017-07","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","callNumber":"RNN","extra":"ISSN: 1063-6919","pages":"1685-1694","proceedingsTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","conferenceName":"2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2017.183","creators":[{"firstName":"Wenhan","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robby T.","lastName":"Tan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jiashi","lastName":"Feng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jiaying","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zongming","lastName":"Guo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shuicheng","lastName":"Yan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer vision","type":1},{"tag":"Feature extraction","type":1},{"tag":"Atmospheric modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"Image restoration","type":1},{"tag":"Rain","type":1},{"tag":"Shape","type":1}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-13T14:09:37Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T14:09:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BFK3DGWN","itemID":1506,"attachments":[{"key":"45HR4RMU","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8099666?arnumber=8099666","accessDate":"2022-10-13T14:09:52Z","parentItem":"BFK3DGWN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8099666.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-13T14:09:52Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T14:09:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/45HR4RMU","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/45HR4RMU/8099666.html","defaultPath":"files/1508/8099666.html"},{"key":"I47YPLY7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8099666&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9ODA5OTY2Ng==","accessDate":"2022-10-13T14:09:43Z","parentItem":"BFK3DGWN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yang et al. - 2017 - Deep Joint Rain Detection and Removal from a Singl.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-13T14:09:43Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T14:09:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/I47YPLY7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/I47YPLY7/Yang et al. - 2017 - Deep Joint Rain Detection and Removal from a Singl.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1507/Yang et al. - 2017 - Deep Joint Rain Detection and Removal from a Singl.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762288,"version":0},"$loki":1000},{"itemID":1084,"item":{"key":"BIQJS9RL","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sampling-Based Robot Motion Planning: A Review","abstractNote":"Motion planning is a fundamental research area in robotics.

This scheme considers the obstacles in the configuration space as prohibited circular areas. Once the obstacles are modelled, the Non-Linear Algebraic Equation System (NAES) is formulated. Next, we apply a Homotopy Path Planning Method (HPPM) to find a set of points that conforms the solution path on the free-space. HPPM uses the Homotopy Continuation Method (HCM) and the Spherical Algorithm (SA) to obtain the solutions of the NAES emanating from the map. In the present work, we propose a scheme for partitioning complex maps into a set of local maps. This is useful for reducing the computation time. Several simulations of complex environment maps with thousands of obstacles are presented. Furthermore, a strategy to obtain the shortest path is applied. Finally, a simulation of the path tracking on Robot Operating System (ROS) for a differential mobile robot is shown.","date":"2016-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2379-447X","pages":"2579-2582","proceedingsTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","conferenceName":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7539120","creators":[{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Diaz-Arango","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"L.","lastName":"Hernandez-Martinez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Sarmiento-Reyes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"H.","lastName":"Vazquez-Leal","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Mobile robots","type":1},{"tag":"Mathematical model","type":1},{"tag":"Computational modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Path Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Mobile robot","type":1},{"tag":"Probabilistic logic","type":1},{"tag":"Complex map","type":1},{"tag":"Electronic mail","type":1},{"tag":"Homotopy continuation methods","type":1},{"tag":"ROS","type":1},{"tag":"Spherical Algorithm","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:42:54Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:42:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BN9W8XXJ","itemID":1164,"attachments":[{"key":"Y39I5BIM","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539120","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:43:13Z","parentItem":"BN9W8XXJ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7539120.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:43:13Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:43:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Y39I5BIM","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/Y39I5BIM/7539120.html","defaultPath":"files/1166/7539120.html"},{"key":"PFSZCMG3","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539120&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50Lzc1MzkxMjA=","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:42:58Z","parentItem":"BN9W8XXJ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Diaz-Arango et al. - 2016 - Fast and robust homotopy path planning method for .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:42:58Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:42:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PFSZCMG3","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/PFSZCMG3/Diaz-Arango et al. - 2016 - Fast and robust homotopy path planning method for .pdf","defaultPath":"files/1165/Diaz-Arango et al. - 2016 - Fast and robust homotopy path planning method for .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762290,"version":0},"$loki":1003},{"itemID":104,"item":{"key":"BP4CRPJV","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Fast Planning Approach for 3D Short Trajectory with a Parallel Framework","abstractNote":"For real applications of unmanned aerial vehicles, the capability of navigating with full autonomy in unknown environments is a crucial requirement. However, planning a shorter path with less computing time is contradictory. To address this problem, we present a framework with the map planner and point cloud planner running in parallel in this paper. The map planner determines the initial path using the improved jump point search method on the 2D map, and then it tries to optimize the path by considering a possible shorter 3D path. The point cloud planner is executed at a high frequency to generate the motion primitives. It makes the drone follow the solved path and avoid the suddenly appearing obstacles nearby. Thus, vehicles can achieve a short trajectory while reacting quickly to the intruding obstacles. We demonstrate fully autonomous quadrotor flight tests in unknown and complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles to validate the proposed method. In simulation and hardware experiments, the proposed framework shows satisfactorily comprehensive performance.","date":"2021-10-20","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10376","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:26:13Z","extra":"arXiv: 2110.10376","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2110.10376 [cs]","creators":[{"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shengyang","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Lu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chih-Yung","lastName":"Wen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:26:13Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:26:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BP4CRPJV","itemID":104,"attachments":[{"key":"GYA97N3P","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10376.pdf","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:26:25Z","parentItem":"BP4CRPJV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chen et al. - 2021 - A Fast Planning Approach for 3D Short Trajectory w.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:26:25Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:26:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GYA97N3P","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/GYA97N3P/Chen et al. - 2021 - A Fast Planning Approach for 3D Short Trajectory w.pdf","defaultPath":"files/106/Chen et al. - 2021 - A Fast Planning Approach for 3D Short Trajectory w.pdf"},{"key":"QDQDA3B7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10376","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:26:30Z","parentItem":"BP4CRPJV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2110.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:26:30Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:26:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QDQDA3B7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/QDQDA3B7/2110.html","defaultPath":"files/107/2110.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"KTE2FTFP","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"BP4CRPJV","note":"Comment: 16 pages","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:26:13Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:26:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KTE2FTFP"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762291,"version":0},"$loki":1004},{"itemID":709,"item":{"key":"BQU6HF9B","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Computationally Efficient Motion Primitive for Quadrocopter Trajectory Generation","abstractNote":"A method is presented for the rapid generation and feasibility verification of motion primitives for quadrocopters and similar multirotor vehicles. The motion primitives are defined by the quadrocopter's initial state, the desired motion duration, and any combination of components of the quadrocopter's position, velocity, and acceleration at the motion's end. Closed-form solutions for the primitives are given, which minimize a cost function related to input aggressiveness. Computationally efficient tests are presented to allow for rapid feasibility verification. Conditions are given under which the existence of feasible primitives can be guaranteed a priori . The algorithm may be incorporated in a high-level trajectory generator, which can then rapidly search over a large number of motion primitives which would achieve some given high-level goal. It is shown that a million motion primitives may be evaluated and compared per second on a standard laptop computer. The motion primitive generation algorithm is experimentally demonstrated by tasking a quadrocopter with an attached net to catch a thrown ball, evaluating thousands of different possible motions to catch the ball.","date":"2015-12","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Robotics","volume":"31","pages":"1294-1310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","DOI":"10.1109/TRO.2015.2479878","issue":"6","ISSN":"1941-0468","creators":[{"firstName":"Mark W.","lastName":"Mueller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Hehn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Raffaello","lastName":"D'Andrea","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Acceleration","type":1},{"tag":"Algorithm design and analysis","type":1},{"tag":"motion control","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Aerial robotics","type":1},{"tag":"üîñ"},{"tag":"Motion control","type":1},{"tag":"motion primitive","type":1},{"tag":"quadrocopter","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:51:25Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:51:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BQU6HF9B","itemID":709,"attachments":[{"key":"SYLKRQ2B","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://undefined/document/7299672/?arnumber=7299672","accessDate":"2022-06-08T09:51:34Z","parentItem":"BQU6HF9B","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7299672.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:51:34Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:51:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SYLKRQ2B","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SYLKRQ2B/7299672.html","defaultPath":"files/711/7299672.html"},{"key":"WL3G7XAI","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://undefined/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7299672&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzI5OTY3Mg==","accessDate":"2022-06-08T09:51:27Z","parentItem":"BQU6HF9B","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mueller et al. - 2015 - A Computationally Efficient Motion Primitive for Q.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:51:27Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:51:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WL3G7XAI","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WL3G7XAI/Mueller et al. - 2015 - A Computationally Efficient Motion Primitive for Q.pdf","defaultPath":"files/710/Mueller et al. - 2015 - A Computationally Efficient Motion Primitive for Q.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762292,"version":0},"$loki":1005},{"itemID":921,"item":{"key":"BSZD8C62","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"The FastMap Algorithm for Shortest Path Computations","abstractNote":"We present a new preprocessing algorithm for embedding the nodes of a given edge-weighted undirected graph into a Euclidean space.

Later, at runtime, a shortest path between any two nodes can be computed with an A* search using the Euclidean distances as heuristic. Our preprocessing algorithm, called FastMap, is inspired by the data-mining algorithm of the same name and runs in near-linear time. Hence, FastMap is orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches that produce a Euclidean embedding using SemideÔ¨Ånite Programming. FastMap also produces admissible and consistent heuristics and therefore guarantees the generation of shortest paths. Moreover, FastMap applies to general undirected graphs for which many traditional heuristics, such as the Manhattan Distance heuristic, are not well deÔ¨Åned.

Many motion prediction methods in the literature implicitly account for environmental factors by learning on observed motion in a fixed environment, and are designed to make predictions in the same environment. In this paper, we address the problem of generating likely motion trajectories for novel environments, represented as occupancy grid maps, where motion has not been observed. We introduce the Occupancy-Conditional Trajectory Network (OTNet) framework, capable of transferring the previously observed motion patterns in known environments to new environments. OTNet provides a functional representation for motion trajectories and utilises neural networks to learn occupancy-conditional distributions over the function parameters. We empirically demonstrate our method‚Äôs ability to generate complex multi-modal trajectory patterns in both simulated and real-world environments.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"7911-7918","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636231","creators":[{"firstName":"Weiming","lastName":"Zhi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tin","lastName":"Lai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Ott","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Ramos","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"Dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Training","type":1},{"tag":"Autonomous systems","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental factors","type":1},{"tag":"Prediction methods","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:44:04Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:44:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BVANSK73","itemID":458,"attachments":[{"key":"MJ5B76RP","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636231?arnumber=9636231","accessDate":"2022-05-18T13:44:18Z","parentItem":"BVANSK73","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9636231.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:44:18Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:44:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MJ5B76RP","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/MJ5B76RP/9636231.html","defaultPath":"files/461/9636231.html"},{"key":"28BR5K9G","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9636231&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTYzNjIzMQ==","accessDate":"2022-05-18T13:44:08Z","parentItem":"BVANSK73","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhi et al. - 2021 - Trajectory Generation in New Environments from Pas.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:44:08Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:44:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/28BR5K9G","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/28BR5K9G/Zhi et al. - 2021 - Trajectory Generation in New Environments from Pas.pdf","defaultPath":"files/459/Zhi et al. - 2021 - Trajectory Generation in New Environments from Pas.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762295,"version":0},"$loki":1008},{"itemID":1016,"item":{"key":"BXER2GID","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"UAV Path Planning Using Optimization Approaches: A Survey","abstractNote":"Path planning is one of the most important steps in the navigation and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

In this paper, we present a method to generate an optimal trajectory restricted to a particular homotopy class, which is specified by a given representative trajectory. The optimality is achieved by formulating the trajectory generation problem as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). We partition the configuration space into nonoverlapping cells and model each cell in the partition with integer variables and inequality constraints. We associate with any sequence of integer variables a word, so that each trajectory can be mapped to a word. We then construct a set of all words that are homotopically equivalent to a given word. For each word, we fix the integer variables of the MIQP to find the optimal time distribution in each cell, by solving a QP for each iteration, to obtain the locally optimal trajectory in the specified homotopy class. We illustrate an example of minimum acceleration trajectory generation on a plane with different homotopy class constraints.","date":"2012","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","place":"Dordrecht","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","ISBN":"978-94-007-4620-6","pages":"83-90","proceedingsTitle":"Latest Advances in Robot Kinematics","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-007-4620-6_11","creators":[{"firstName":"Soonkyum","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Koushil","lastName":"Sreenath","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jadran","lastName":"Lenarcic","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Husty","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Trajectory planning","type":1},{"tag":"homotopy constraint","type":1},{"tag":"optimal trajectory","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-19T11:08:00Z","dateModified":"2022-08-19T11:08:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BXHQ9TPR","itemID":1264,"attachments":[{"key":"P2478M4X","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-94-007-4620-6_11.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-19T11:08:01Z","parentItem":"BXHQ9TPR","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kim et al. - 2012 - Trajectory Planning for Systems with Homotopy Clas.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-19T11:08:01Z","dateModified":"2022-08-19T11:08:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/P2478M4X","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/P2478M4X/Kim et al. - 2012 - Trajectory Planning for Systems with Homotopy Clas.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1265/Kim et al. - 2012 - Trajectory Planning for Systems with Homotopy Clas.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762296,"version":0},"$loki":1010},{"itemID":56,"item":{"key":"BXJ3LU6C","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Flying Free: A Research Overview of Deep Learning in Drone Navigation Autonomy","abstractNote":"With the rise of Deep Learning approaches in computer vision applications, significant strides have been made towards vehicular autonomy. Research activity in autonomous drone navigation has increased rapidly in the past five years, and drones are moving fast towards the ultimate goal of near-complete autonomy. However, while much work in the area focuses on specific tasks in drone navigation, the contribution to the overall goal of autonomy is often not assessed, and a comprehensive overview is needed. In this work, a taxonomy of drone navigation autonomy is established by mapping the definitions of vehicular autonomy levels, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, to specific drone tasks in order to create a clear definition of autonomy when applied to drones. A top‚Äìdown examination of research work in the area is conducted, focusing on drone navigation tasks, in order to understand the extent of research activity in each area. Autonomy levels are cross-checked against the drone navigation tasks addressed in each work to provide a framework for understanding the trajectory of current research. This work serves as a guide to research in drone autonomy with a particular focus on Deep Learning-based solutions, indicating key works and areas of opportunity for development of this area in the future.","date":"2021/6","language":"en","shortTitle":"Flying Free","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/5/2/52","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:41:30Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 2\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"5","pages":"52","publicationTitle":"Drones","DOI":"10.3390/drones5020052","issue":"2","ISSN":"2504-446X","creators":[{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan","lastName":"Mckeever","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Courtney","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"artificial intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"artificial neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"autonomous systems","type":1},{"tag":"deep learning","type":1},{"tag":"internet of things","type":1},{"tag":"machine vision","type":1},{"tag":"multi-layer neural network","type":1},{"tag":"neural network hardware","type":1},{"tag":"neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"unmanned autonomous vehicles","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:41:30Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:41:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BXJ3LU6C","itemID":56,"attachments":[{"key":"7CFBM2CV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/5/2/52/pdf?version=1623925607","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:41:30Z","parentItem":"BXJ3LU6C","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lee et al. - 2021 - Flying Free A Research Overview of Deep Learning .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:41:30Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:41:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7CFBM2CV","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/7CFBM2CV/Lee et al. - 2021 - Flying Free A Research Overview of Deep Learning .pdf","defaultPath":"files/57/Lee et al. - 2021 - Flying Free A Research Overview of Deep Learning .pdf"},{"key":"48JBB5JL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/5/2/52","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:41:36Z","parentItem":"BXJ3LU6C","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"52.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:41:36Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:41:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/48JBB5JL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/48JBB5JL/52.html","defaultPath":"files/58/52.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762297,"version":0},"$loki":1011},{"itemID":1536,"item":{"key":"BXMAFS7T","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"An introduction to Topological Data Analysis: fundamental and practical aspects for data scientists","abstractNote":"Topological Data Analysis (tda) is a recent and fast growing Ô¨Åeld providing a set of new topological and geometric tools to infer relevant features for possibly complex data.

In many applications, however, a physical apparatus may have constrained controls, leading to constraints on its potential dynamics.

In many emergency situations, precise navigation between obstacles and time-efficient searching around 3D structures is essential for finding survivors. In this work we propose an integrated assessment and search planning approach which allows an autonomous UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) agent to plan and execute collision-free search trajectories in 3D environments. More specifically, the proposed search-planning framework aims to integrate and automate the first two phases (i.e., the assessment phase and the search phase) of a traditional search-and-rescue (SAR) mission. In the first stage, termed assessment-planning we aim to find a high-level assessment plan which the UAV agent can execute in order to visit a set of points of interest. The generated plan of this stage guides the UAV to fly over the objects of interest thus providing a first assessment of the situation at hand. In the second stage, termed search-planning, the UAV trajectory is further fine-tuned to allow the UAV to search in 3D (i.e., across all faces) the objects of interest for survivors. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive simulation analysis.","date":"2021-06","shortTitle":"3D Trajectory Planning for UAV-based Search Missions","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"517-526","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476869","creators":[{"firstName":"Savvas","lastName":"Papaioannou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Panayiotis","lastName":"Kolios","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Theocharis","lastName":"Theocharides","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christos G.","lastName":"Panayiotou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marios M.","lastName":"Polycarpou","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Three-dimensional displays","type":1},{"tag":"Solid modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory planning","type":1},{"tag":"Analytical models","type":1},{"tag":"Search problems","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:20:20Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:20:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/CBHBTEUA","itemID":257,"attachments":[{"key":"BD6DH7XZ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476869/?arnumber=9476869","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:20:39Z","parentItem":"CBHBTEUA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476869.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:20:39Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:20:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/BD6DH7XZ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/BD6DH7XZ/9476869.html","defaultPath":"files/259/9476869.html"},{"key":"R9PE636Y","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476869&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3Njg2OQ==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:20:26Z","parentItem":"CBHBTEUA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Papaioannou et al. - 2021 - 3D Trajectory Planning for UAV-based Search Missio.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:20:26Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:20:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/R9PE636Y","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/R9PE636Y/Papaioannou et al. - 2021 - 3D Trajectory Planning for UAV-based Search Missio.pdf","defaultPath":"files/258/Papaioannou et al. - 2021 - 3D Trajectory Planning for UAV-based Search Missio.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762299,"version":0},"$loki":1014},{"itemID":1160,"item":{"key":"CHZUMEYG","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"A Homotopy Method for Motion Planning","abstractNote":"We propose a novel method for motion planning and illustrate its implementation on several canonical examples. The core novel idea underlying the method is to define a metric for which a path of minimal length is an admissible path, that is path that respects the various constraints imposed by the environment and the physics of the system on its dynamics. To be more precise, our method takes as input a control system with holonomic and non-holonomic constraints, an initial and final point in configuration space, a description of obstacles to avoid, and an initial trajectory for the system, called a sketch. This initial trajectory does not need to meet the constraints, except for the obstacle avoidance constraints. The constraints are then encoded in an inner product, which is used to deform (via a homotopy) the initial sketch into an admissible trajectory from which controls realizing the transfer can be obtained. We illustrate the method on various examples, including vehicle motion with obstacles and a two-link manipulator problem.","date":"2019-01-28","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10094","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:40:00Z","extra":"arXiv:1901.10094 [cs, math]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1901.10094","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:1901.10094","creators":[{"firstName":"Shenyu","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohamed Ali","lastName":"Belabbas","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1},{"tag":"Mathematics - Optimization and Control","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:40:00Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:40:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/CHZUMEYG","itemID":1160,"attachments":[{"key":"5IHKPCJG","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10094.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:40:36Z","parentItem":"CHZUMEYG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu and Belabbas - 2019 - A Homotopy Method for Motion Planning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:40:36Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:40:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5IHKPCJG","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/5IHKPCJG/Liu and Belabbas - 2019 - A Homotopy Method for Motion Planning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1161/Liu and Belabbas - 2019 - A Homotopy Method for Motion Planning.pdf"},{"key":"DAFNJH5I","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10094","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:40:41Z","parentItem":"CHZUMEYG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1901.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:40:41Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:40:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/DAFNJH5I","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/DAFNJH5I/1901.html","defaultPath":"files/1162/1901.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762300,"version":0},"$loki":1015},{"itemID":477,"item":{"key":"CL6ICET5","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"B-spline path planner for safe navigation of mobile robots","abstractNote":"We propose a 2D path planning algorithm in a non-convex workspace defined as a sequence of connected convex polytopes.

The novelties of the paper lie in the use of the equivalent B√©zier representation of the B-spline curve, which significantly reduces the conservatism in the local convexity bound and in the integration of these constraints into a convex quadratic optimization problem, which minimizes the curve length.

The role of low-light image enhancement is to improve the visual effect of such images for the benefit of subsequent processing. This paper reviews the main techniques of low-light image enhancement developed over the past decades. First, we present a new classification of these algorithms, dividing them into seven categories: gray transformation methods, histogram equalization methods, Retinex methods, frequency-domain methods, image fusion methods, defogging model methods and machine learning methods.

Popular approaches like CEM [37] and CMA-ES [16] greedily focus on promising regions of the search space and may get trapped in local maxima. DOO [31] and VOOT [22] balance exploration and exploitation, but use space partitioning strategies independent of the reward function to be optimized. Recently, LaMCTS [45] empirically learns to partition the search space in a reward-sensitive manner for black-box optimization. In this paper, we develop a novel formal regret analysis for when and why such an adaptive region partitioning scheme works. We also propose a new path planning method LaP3 which improves the function value estimation within each sub-region, and uses a latent representation of the search space. Empirically, LaP3 outperforms existing path planning methods in 2D navigation tasks, especially in the presence of difÔ¨Åcult-to-escape local optima, and shows beneÔ¨Åts when plugged into the planning components of model-based RL such as PETS [7]. These gains transfer to highly multimodal real-world tasks, where we outperform strong baselines in compiler phase ordering by up to 39% on average across 9 tasks, and in molecular design by up to 0.4 on properties on a 0-1 scale.

Planning for aggressive flight with trajectory optimization could be incredibly fast, even in higher dimensions, and can account for dynamics of the quadrotor, however, only provides a locally optimal solution. On the other hand, planning with discrete graph search can handle non-convex spaces to guarantee optimality but suffers from exponential complexity with the dimension of search. We introduce a framework for aggressive quadrotor trajectory generation with global reasoning capabilities that combines the best of trajectory optimization and discrete graph search. Specifically, we develop a novel algorithmic framework that interleaves these two methods to complement each other and generate trajectories with provable guarantees on completeness up to discretization. We demonstrate and quantitatively analyze the performance of our algorithm in challenging simulation environments with narrow gaps that create severe attitude constraints and push the dynamic capabilities of the quadrotor. Experiments show the benefits of the proposed algorithmic framework over standalone trajectory optimization and graph search-based planning techniques for aggressive quadrotor flight.","date":"7/2021","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12548","accessDate":"2022-05-23T15:25:48Z","extra":"arXiv:2101.12548 [cs]","volume":"6","pages":"5357-5364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LRA.2021.3067298","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Robot.

The explainable model is on a visual platform in the format of if-then rules derived from the Sugeno-type fuzzy inference model. The model is tested using the data recorded from three different missions. In each mission, adverse weather, conditions and enemy locations are introduced at random locations along the path of the mission. There are two phases to the model development. In the first phase, the Mamdani fuzzy model is used to create rules to steer the UAV along the designated mission and the rules of engagement when it encounters weather and enemy locations along and near its chosen mission. The data are gathered as UAV traverses on each mission. In the second phase, the data gathered from these missions are used to create a reverse model using a Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system based on the subtractive clustering in the data. The model has seven inputs (time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, heading direction, engage in attack, continue mission, and steer UAV) and two outputs (weather conditions and distance from the enemy). This model predicts the outputs regarding the weather conditions and enemy positions whenever UAV deviates from the predefined path. The model is optimized with respect to the number of rules and prediction accuracy by adjusting subtractive clustering parameters. The model is then fine-tuned with ANFIS. The final model has six rules and root mean square error value that is less than 0.05. Furthermore, to check the robustness of the model, the Gaussian random noise is added to a UAV path, and the prediction accuracy is validated.","date":"2019","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Access","volume":"7","pages":"17001-17016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893141","ISSN":"2169-3536","creators":[{"firstName":"Blen M.","lastName":"Keneni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Devinder","lastName":"Kaur","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Al Bataineh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijaya K.","lastName":"Devabhaktuni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ahmad Y.","lastName":"Javaid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jack D.","lastName":"Zaientz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert P.","lastName":"Marinier","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Atmospheric modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"Data models","type":1},{"tag":"ANFIS","type":1},{"tag":"Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)","type":1},{"tag":"fuzzy logic","type":1},{"tag":"Fuzzy logic","type":1},{"tag":"Fuzzy sets","type":1},{"tag":"Predictive models","type":1},{"tag":"subtractive clustering","type":1},{"tag":"unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-25T13:01:53Z","dateModified":"2022-05-25T13:01:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/D6HLTCKT","itemID":601,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762318,"version":0},"$loki":1023},{"itemID":1256,"item":{"key":"DA6IMCRR","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Topology-aware RRT for parallel optimal sampling in topologies","abstractNote":"In interactive human-robot path-planning, a capability for expressing the path topology provides a natural mechanism for describing task requirements.

This prompts finding or exploring the different homology classes in such environments and finding representative optimal trajectories in each such class. In this paper we start by considering the general problem of finding a complete set of easily computable homology class invariants for (N‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1)-cycles in (‚Ñù. We achieve this by finding explicit generators of the (N‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1)stde Rham cohomology group of this punctured Euclidean space, and using their integrals to define cocycles. The action of those dual cocycles on (N‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1)-cycles gives the desired complete set of invariants. We illustrate the computation through examples. We then show, for the case when N‚Äâ=‚Äâ2, due to the integral approach in our formulation, this complete set of invariants is well-suited for efficient search-based planning of optimal robot trajectories with topological constraints. In particular, we show how to construct an ‚Äòaugmented graph‚Äô, $\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}}$, from an arbitrary graph $\\mathcal{G}$in the configuration space. A graph construction and search algorithm can hence be used to find optimal trajectories in different topological classes. Finally, we extend this approach to computation of invariants in spaces derived from (‚Ñùby collapsing a subspace, thereby permitting application to a wider class of non-Euclidean ambient spaces.","date":"2013-03-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10472-013-9357-7","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:49:29Z","volume":"67","pages":"251-281","publicationTitle":"Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1007/s10472-013-9357-7","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Ann Math Artif Intell","ISSN":"1573-7470","creators":[{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lipsky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Ghrist","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üîñ"},{"tag":"Robot path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Algebraic topolgy","type":1},{"tag":"Differential topology","type":1},{"tag":"Homology invariant","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:49:29Z","dateModified":"2022-08-17T09:03:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/DAF6WBN9","itemID":1184,"attachments":[{"key":"B6WNNHGF","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10472-013-9357-7.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:49:30Z","parentItem":"DAF6WBN9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bhattacharya et al. - 2013 - Invariants for homology classes with application t.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:49:30Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:49:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/B6WNNHGF","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/B6WNNHGF/Bhattacharya et al. - 2013 - Invariants for homology classes with application t.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1185/Bhattacharya et al. - 2013 - Invariants for homology classes with application t.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762319,"version":0},"$loki":1025},{"itemID":964,"item":{"key":"DCY53JKY","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Jump Point Search with Temporal Obstacles","abstractNote":"In 4-connected grid-based path planning one often needs to account for temporal and moving obstacles: ones that appear, disappear and which can prevent the agent from reaching its target.

The FFA-Net architecture consists of three key components: 1) A novel Feature Attention (FA) module combines Channel Attention with Pixel Attention mechanism, considering that different channel-wise features contain totally different weighted information and haze distribution is uneven on the different image pixels. FA treats different features and pixels unequally, which provides additional flexibility in dealing with different types of information, expanding the representational ability of CNNs. 2) A basic block structure consists of Local Residual Learning and Feature Attention, Local Residual Learning allowing the less important information such as thin haze region or low-frequency to be bypassed through multiple local residual connections, let main network architecture focus on more effective information. 3) An Attention-based different levels Feature Fusion (FFA) structure, the feature weights are adaptively learned from the Feature Attention (FA) module, giving more weight to important features. This structure can also retain the information of shallow layers and pass it into deep layers.

Current approaches have however either assumed the knowledge of differential one-forms related to a skeletonization of the collision space, or have relied on a simplicial representation of the free space. Both of these approaches are currently however not yet practical for higher dimensional configuration spaces. We propose 2D topological task projections (TTPs): mappings from the configuration space to 2-dimensional spaces where simplicial complex filtrations and persistent homology can identify topological properties of the high-dimensional free configuration space. Our approach only requires the availability of collision free samples to identify winding centers that can be used to determine homotopy inequivalent trajectories. We propose the Winding Augmented RRT and RRT* (WA-RRT/RRT*) algorithms using which homotopy inequivalent trajectories can be found. We evaluate our approach in experiments with configuration spaces of planar linkages with 2-10 degrees of freedom. Results indicate that our approach can reliably identify suitable topological task projections and our proposed WA-RRT and WA-RRT* algorithms were able to identify a collection of homotopy inequivalent trajectories in each considered configuration space dimension.","date":"2016-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"24-31","proceedingsTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","conferenceName":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487113","creators":[{"firstName":"Florian T.","lastName":"Pokorny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Danica","lastName":"Kragic","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lydia E.","lastName":"Kavraki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"Approximation algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Computer science","type":1},{"tag":"Windings","type":1},{"tag":"Couplings","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T13:17:21Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T13:17:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/DW8SYGRE","itemID":1279,"attachments":[{"key":"75EQAVBT","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487113","accessDate":"2022-08-23T13:18:07Z","parentItem":"DW8SYGRE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7487113.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T13:18:07Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T13:18:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/75EQAVBT","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/75EQAVBT/7487113.html","defaultPath":"files/1281/7487113.html"},{"key":"26G27N3A","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487113&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50Lzc0ODcxMTM=","accessDate":"2022-08-23T13:17:28Z","parentItem":"DW8SYGRE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pokorny et al. - 2016 - High-dimensional Winding-Augmented Motion Planning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T13:17:28Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T13:17:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/26G27N3A","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/26G27N3A/Pokorny et al. - 2016 - High-dimensional Winding-Augmented Motion Planning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1280/Pokorny et al. - 2016 - High-dimensional Winding-Augmented Motion Planning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762326,"version":0},"$loki":1032},{"itemID":1540,"item":{"key":"DWTLAWYT","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"The sciences of the artificial","date":"2008","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"K10plus ISBN","place":"Cambridge, Mass.","publisher":"MIT Press","ISBN":"978-0-262-19374-0 978-0-262-69191-8","edition":"3. ed., [Nachdr.]","numPages":"231","creators":[{"firstName":"Herbert Alexander","lastName":"Simon","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-19T09:45:16Z","dateModified":"2022-10-19T09:45:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/DWTLAWYT","itemID":1540,"attachments":[{"key":"UB7ZZ54R","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Simon - 2008 - The sciences of the artificial.pdf","url":"https://monoskop.org/images/9/9c/Simon_Herbert_A_The_Sciences_of_the_Artificial_3rd_ed.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-19T09:45:14Z","parentItem":"DWTLAWYT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Simon - 2008 - The sciences of the artificial.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-19T09:45:14Z","dateModified":"2022-10-19T09:45:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/UB7ZZ54R","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/UB7ZZ54R/Simon - 2008 - The sciences of the artificial.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1539/Simon - 2008 - The sciences of the artificial.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762327,"version":0},"$loki":1033},{"itemID":315,"item":{"key":"DXRARXW7","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A two-step approach to see-through bad weather for surveillance video quality enhancement","abstractNote":"Adverse weather conditions such as snow, fog or heavy rain greatly reduce the visual quality of outdoor surveillance videos. Video quality enhancement can improve the visual quality of surveillance videos providing clearer images with more details. Existing work in this area mainly focuses on quality enhancement for high resolution videos or still images, but few algorithms are developed for enhancing surveillance videos, which normally have low resolution, high noise and compression artifacts. In addition, for snow or rain conditions, the image quality of near-filed view is degraded by the obscuration of apparent snowflakes and raindrops, while the quality of far field view is degraded by the obscuration of fog-like snowflakes or raindrops. Very few video quality enhancement algorithms have been developed to handle both problems. In this paper, we propose a novel video quality enhancement algorithm for see-through snow, fog or heavy rain. The proposed algorithm has two major steps: 1. the near-field enhancement algorithm identifies obscuration pixels by snow or rain in the near-field view and removes these pixels as snowflakes or rain drops; different from state-of-the-art methods, the algorithm in this step can detect snowflakes on foreground object and background, and choose different methods to fill in the removed regions. 2. the far-field enhancement algorithm restores the image's contrast information not only to reveal more details in the far-field view but also to enhance the overall image's quality; in this step, the proposed algorithm adaptively enhances the global and local contrast, which is inspired on the human visual system, and accounts for the perceptual sensitivity to noise, compression artifacts, and the texture of image content. From our extensive testing, the proposed approach significantly improves the visual quality of surveillance videos by removing snow/fog/rain effects.","date":"2011-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"5309-5314","proceedingsTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","conferenceName":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979596","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Jia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hongcheng","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Caballero","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ziyou","lastName":"Xiong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Finn","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Training","type":1},{"tag":"Rain","type":1},{"tag":"Snow","type":1},{"tag":"Histograms","type":1},{"tag":"Image color analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Noise","type":1},{"tag":"Surveillance","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T11:05:50Z","dateModified":"2022-06-07T14:51:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/DXRARXW7","itemID":315,"attachments":[{"key":"NGLALTQE","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5979596/?arnumber=5979596","accessDate":"2022-04-25T11:05:58Z","parentItem":"DXRARXW7","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"5979596.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T11:05:58Z","dateModified":"2022-04-25T11:05:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NGLALTQE","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/NGLALTQE/5979596.html","defaultPath":"files/317/5979596.html"},{"key":"WNFQ534G","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979596&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NTk3OTU5Ng==","accessDate":"2022-04-25T11:05:53Z","parentItem":"DXRARXW7","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Jia et al. - 2011 - A two-step approach to see-through bad weather for.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T11:05:53Z","dateModified":"2022-04-25T11:05:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WNFQ534G","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WNFQ534G/Jia et al. - 2011 - A two-step approach to see-through bad weather for.pdf","defaultPath":"files/316/Jia et al. - 2011 - A two-step approach to see-through bad weather for.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762328,"version":0},"$loki":1034},{"itemID":1529,"item":{"key":"E2DF77QU","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"D3R-Net: Dynamic Routing Residue Recurrent Network for Video Rain Removal","abstractNote":"In this paper, we address the problem of video rain removal by considering rain occlusion regions, i.e., very low light transmittance for rain streaks. Different from additive rain streaks, in such occlusion regions, the details of backgrounds are completely lost. Therefore, we propose a hybrid rain model to depict both rain streaks and occlusions. Integrating the hybrid model and useful motion segmentation context information, we present a Dynamic Routing Residue Recurrent Network (D3R-Net). D3R-Net Ô¨Årst extracts the spatial features by a residual network. Then, the spatial features are aggregated by recurrent units along the temporal axis. In the temporal fusion, the context information is embedded into the network in a ‚Äúdynamic routing‚Äù way. A heap of recurrent units takes responsibility for handling the temporal fusion in given contexts, e.g., rain or non-rain regions. In the certain forward and backward processes, one of these recurrent units is mainly activated. Then, a context selection gate is employed to detect the context and select one of these temporally fused features generated by these recurrent units as the Ô¨Ånal fused feature. Finally, this last feature plays a role of ‚Äúresidual feature.‚Äù It is combined with the spatial feature and then used to reconstruct the negative rain streaks. In such a D3R-Net, we incorporate motion segmentation, which denotes whether a pixel belongs to fast moving edges or not, and rain type indicator, indicating whether a pixel belongs to rain streaks, rain occlusions, and non-rain regions, as the context variables. Extensive experiments on a series of synthetic and real videos with rain streaks verify not only the superiority of the proposed method over state of the art but also the effectiveness of our network design and its each component.

One reason is that second-order optimality requires calculating Hessian matrices that can grow with O(N2) with the number of waypoints. Decreasing the waypoints can quadratically decrease computation time. Unfortunately, fewer waypoints result in lower quality trajectories that may not avoid the collision. To have both, dense waypoints and reduced computation time, we took inspiration from recent studies on consensus optimization and propose a distributed formulation of collocated trajectory optimization. It breaks a long trajectory into several segments, where each segment becomes a subproblem of a few waypoints. These subproblems are solved classically, but in parallel, and the solutions are fused into a single trajectory with a consensus constraint that enforces continuity of the segments through a consensus update. With this scheme, the quadratic complexity is distributed to each segment and enables solving for higher-quality trajectories with denser waypoints. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is amenable to using any existing trajectory optimizer for solving the subproblems.

The painstakingly handcrafted feature extractors used in traditional learning, classification, and pattern recognition systems are not scalable for large-sized data sets. In many cases, depending on the problem complexity, DL can also overcome the limitations of earlier shallow networks that prevented efficient training and abstractions of hierarchical representations of multi-dimensional training data. Deep neural network (DNN) uses multiple (deep) layers of units with highly optimized algorithms and architectures. This paper reviews several optimization methods to improve the accuracy of the training and to reduce training time. We delve into the math behind training algorithms used in recent deep networks. We describe current shortcomings, enhancements, and implementations. The review also covers different types of deep architectures, such as deep convolution networks, deep residual networks, recurrent neural networks, reinforcement learning, variational autoencoders, and others.","date":"2019","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Access","volume":"7","pages":"53040-53065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912200","ISSN":"2169-3536","creators":[{"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Shrestha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ausif","lastName":"Mahmood","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"artificial intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"Training","type":1},{"tag":"Feature extraction","type":1},{"tag":"Recurrent neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"optimization","type":1},{"tag":"backpropagation","type":1},{"tag":"Computer architecture","type":1},{"tag":"convolution neural network","type":1},{"tag":"Deep learning","type":1},{"tag":"deep neural network architectures","type":1},{"tag":"Feedforward neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"Machine learning algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"supervised and unsupervised learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/CIRGU82Q"]},"dateAdded":"2022-05-25T13:48:01Z","dateModified":"2022-07-12T13:50:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/E9YFAIKA","itemID":603,"attachments":[{"key":"N48GAMJ3","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8694781?arnumber=8694781","accessDate":"2022-06-21T11:18:19Z","parentItem":"E9YFAIKA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8694781.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-21T11:18:19Z","dateModified":"2022-07-12T13:50:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/N48GAMJ3","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/N48GAMJ3/8694781.html","defaultPath":"files/817/8694781.html"},{"key":"TY2QQYBT","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08694781.pdf?tp=&arnumber=8694781&isnumber=8600701&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9ODY5NDc4MQ==","accessDate":"2022-06-21T11:18:02Z","parentItem":"E9YFAIKA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Shrestha and Mahmood - 2019 - Review of Deep Learning Algorithms and Architectur.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-21T11:18:02Z","dateModified":"2022-07-12T13:50:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TY2QQYBT","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/TY2QQYBT/Shrestha and Mahmood - 2019 - Review of Deep Learning Algorithms and Architectur.pdf","defaultPath":"files/816/Shrestha and Mahmood - 2019 - Review of Deep Learning Algorithms and Architectur.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762333,"version":0},"$loki":1040},{"itemID":793,"item":{"key":"EBW597AS","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A survey of learning-based robot motion planning","abstractNote":"A fundamental task in robotics is to plan collision-free motions among a set of obstacles.

However, the convergence rate can be slow for high-dimensional planning problems, particularly for dynamical systems where the sampling space is not just the configuration space but the full state space. In this paper, we introduce the idea of using a partial-final-state-free (PFF) optimal controller in kinodynamic RRT* [1] to reduce the dimensionality of the sampling space. Instead of sampling the full state space, the proposed accelerated kinodynamic RRT*, called Kino-RRT*, only samples part of the state space, while the rest of the states are selected by the PFF optimal controller. We also propose a delayed and intermittent update of the optimal arrival time of all the edges in the RRT* tree to decrease the computation complexity. We tested the proposed algorithm using 4-D and 10-D state-space linear systems and showed that Kino-RRT* converges much faster than the kinodynamic RRT* algorithm.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"3674-3680","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636754","creators":[{"firstName":"Dongliang","lastName":"Zheng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Tsiotras","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Aerospace electronics","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Real-time systems","type":1},{"tag":"Dynamical systems","type":1},{"tag":"Linear systems","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:56:29Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:56:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EP8EQ3CZ","itemID":474,"attachments":[{"key":"E8CBGC8R","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636754?arnumber=9636754","accessDate":"2022-05-18T13:56:56Z","parentItem":"EP8EQ3CZ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9636754.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:56:56Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:56:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/E8CBGC8R","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/E8CBGC8R/9636754.html","defaultPath":"files/476/9636754.html"},{"key":"KIPHYQ68","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9636754&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTYzNjc1NA==","accessDate":"2022-05-18T13:56:32Z","parentItem":"EP8EQ3CZ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zheng and Tsiotras - 2021 - Accelerating Kinodynamic RRT Through Dimensionalit.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:56:32Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:56:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KIPHYQ68","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/KIPHYQ68/Zheng and Tsiotras - 2021 - Accelerating Kinodynamic RRT Through Dimensionalit.pdf","defaultPath":"files/475/Zheng and Tsiotras - 2021 - Accelerating Kinodynamic RRT Through Dimensionalit.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762336,"version":0},"$loki":1043},{"itemID":1072,"item":{"key":"EU899XLD","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fast Methods for Eikonal Equations: An Experimental Survey","abstractNote":"Fast methods are very popular algorithms to compute time-of-arrival maps (distance maps measured in time units) solving the Eikonal equation.

First, the RRT algorithm is used to generate the initial path, then the minimum snap algorithm is used to smooth the initial path and obtain a trajectory suitable for the actual flight of the UAV. However, because the UAV is considered as a particle in the simulation, during the actual flight, this trajectory may not guarantee the safe flight of the UAV and may cause the UAV to collide with an obstacle or other nearby UAVs in the cases of formation flight. To solve this problem, flight corridor concept is used to limit the UAV's flight trajectory for ensuring the safe flight of the UAV. Simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively ensure the safety, smoothness, feasibility, and trajectory of unmanned aerial vehicles.","date":"2020-11","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2688-0938","pages":"4227-4232","proceedingsTitle":"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)","conferenceName":"2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)","DOI":"10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326562","creators":[{"firstName":"Bohui","lastName":"Shi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Youmin","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lingxia","lastName":"Mu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Xin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yingmin","lastName":"Yi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shangbin","lastName":"Jiao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Xie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Safety","type":1},{"tag":"UAV","type":1},{"tag":"Flight corridor","type":1},{"tag":"Forestry","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Minimum snap","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"RRT","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Vegetation","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:32:02Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:32:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EV3DVH22","itemID":44,"attachments":[{"key":"DE4M6C6A","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9326562?arnumber=9326562","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:32:14Z","parentItem":"EV3DVH22","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9326562.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:32:14Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:32:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/DE4M6C6A","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/DE4M6C6A/9326562.html","defaultPath":"files/46/9326562.html"},{"key":"TTQ7B88Z","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9326562&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTMyNjU2Mg==","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:32:04Z","parentItem":"EV3DVH22","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Shi et al. - 2020 - UAV Trajectory Generation Based on Integration of .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:32:04Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:32:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TTQ7B88Z","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/TTQ7B88Z/Shi et al. - 2020 - UAV Trajectory Generation Based on Integration of .pdf","defaultPath":"files/45/Shi et al. - 2020 - UAV Trajectory Generation Based on Integration of .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762339,"version":0},"$loki":1045},{"itemID":242,"item":{"key":"EVXYQYVD","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Exact Reactive Receding Horizon Motion Planning for Aerial Vehicles","abstractNote":"This article presents a motion planning strategy that integrates a reactive receding horizon local trajectory generation methodology with a navigation function based global planner to guarantee that a quadrotor type mav navigating in partially-known cluttered environment can reach its goal.

These obstacles are avoided reactively at the level of the local planner, which reacts to sensing information within the Field of View (fov) of the onboard sensors and keeps generating dynamically feasible safe trajectories along the segments generated by the global planner.

In order to improve the exploration ability, multiple UAVs, which controlled by the same policy network, are used to perform tasks in each episode.

That is, while dealing with uncertainties, a motion planner must update its trajectory, adapting to the newly revealed environment in real-time; failing to do so may involve unsafe circumstances. Many existing planning algorithms guarantee these by maintaining the clearance needed to perform an emergency brake, which is itself a robust and persistently feasible maneuver. However, such maneuvers are not applicable for systems in which braking is impossible or risky, such as fixed-wing aircraft. To that end, we propose a real-time robust planner that recursively guarantees persistent feasibility without any need of braking. The planner ensures robustness against bounded uncertainties and persistent feasibility by constructing a loop of sequentially composed funnels, starting from the receding horizon local trajectory‚Äôs forward reachable set. We implement the proposed algorithm for a robotic car tracking a speed-fixed reference trajectory. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can be run at faster than 16 Hz, while successfully keeping the system away from entering any dead end, to maintain safety and feasibility.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"1434-1441","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636048","creators":[{"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Jang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dongjae","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Seungjae","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"H.

Coupled with the increased accessibility to ocean flow data, there has been a significant interest in developing energy efficient motion plans for these vehicles that leverage the dynamics of the surrounding flow. In this paper, we present a graph search based method to plan time and energy optimal paths in static and time-varying flow fields. We also use tools from topological path planning to generate optimal paths in different homotopy classes to facilitate simultaneous exploration of the environment by multi-robot teams. The proposed strategy is validated using analytical flow models, actual ocean data, and in experiments using an indoor laboratory testbed capable of creating flows with ocean-like features. We also present an alternative approach using a Riemannian metric based approximation for the cost functions in the static flow case for computing time and energy optimal paths. The Riemannian approximation results in smoother trajectories in contrast to the graph based strategy while requiring less computational time.","date":"2018-10-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Going with the flow","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-018-9741-6","accessDate":"2022-08-24T12:31:37Z","volume":"42","pages":"1369-1387","publicationTitle":"Autonomous Robots","DOI":"10.1007/s10514-018-9741-6","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"Auton Robot","ISSN":"1573-7527","creators":[{"firstName":"Dhanushka","lastName":"Kularatne","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.

Practical applications favor \"anytime\" algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT% committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods.

As a first contribution, we have extended the method proposed by Jenkins to generate the topological information by taking into consideration the constraints of the workspace during the construction of the topological environment, which is then used to compute topological paths. As a second contribution, a planner based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), called Homotopic RRT (HRRT) is proposed to use the topological information to guide the path search in the workspace. Finally, simulated and real results with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are presented showing the feasibility of the proposal.

Anytime planners are ideal for these types of problems as they find an initial solution quickly and then improve it as time allows. In this paper, we develop an anytime planner that builds off of Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP), which is a fast A*-variant for planning in dynamic environments that uses intervals instead of timesteps to represent the time dimension of the problem. In addition, we introduce an optional time-horizon after which the planner drops time as a dimension. On the theoretical side, we show that in the absence of time-horizon our planner can provide guarantees on completeness as well as bounds on the sub-optimality of the solution with respect to the original space-time graph. We also provide simulation experiments for planning for a UAV among 50 dynamic obstacles, where we can provide safe paths for the next 15 seconds of execution within 0.05 seconds. Our results provide a strong evidence for our planner working under real-time constraints.","date":"2012-10","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"4708-4715","proceedingsTitle":"2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","conferenceName":"2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","DOI":"10.1109/IROS.2012.6386191","creators":[{"firstName":"Venkatraman","lastName":"Narayanan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Phillips","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1}],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YP5NUUQ6"]},"dateAdded":"2022-07-12T14:09:28Z","dateModified":"2022-07-14T13:01:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FR7TKUJM","itemID":969,"attachments":[{"key":"8W8P3IZ4","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386191?arnumber=6386191","accessDate":"2022-07-12T14:09:44Z","parentItem":"FR7TKUJM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"6386191.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-12T14:09:44Z","dateModified":"2022-07-12T14:09:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8W8P3IZ4","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8W8P3IZ4/6386191.html","defaultPath":"files/971/6386191.html"},{"key":"MD7CGGCS","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6386191&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NjM4NjE5MQ==","accessDate":"2022-07-12T14:09:31Z","parentItem":"FR7TKUJM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Narayanan et al. - 2012 - Anytime Safe Interval Path Planning for dynamic en.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-12T14:09:31Z","dateModified":"2022-07-12T14:09:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MD7CGGCS","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/MD7CGGCS/Narayanan et al. - 2012 - Anytime Safe Interval Path Planning for dynamic en.pdf","defaultPath":"files/970/Narayanan et al. - 2012 - Anytime Safe Interval Path Planning for dynamic en.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762347,"version":0},"$loki":1053},{"itemID":1340,"item":{"key":"FRHVJLR9","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sampling-based Motion Planning with Deterministic ¬µ-Calculus SpeciÔ¨Åcations","abstractNote":"In this paper, we propose algorithms for the online computation of control programs for dynamical systems that provably satisfy a class of temporal logic speciÔ¨Åcations.

As a result, they can often solve a sequence of similar planning problems faster than planning from scratch. State-of-the-art incremental heuristic searches (such as LPA*, D* and D* Lite) work by propagating cost changes to all the states in the search tree whose g values (the costs of computed paths from the start state) are no longer optimal. This work is based on the observation that while a complete propagation of cost changes is essential to ensure optimality, the propagations can be stopped earlier if we are looking close-to-optimal solutions instead of the optimal one. We develop a framework called Truncated Incremental Search that builds on this observation and uses a target suboptimality bound to efficiently restrict cost propagations. We present two truncation based algorithms, Truncated LPA* (TLPA*) and Truncated D* Lite (TD* Lite), for bounded suboptimal planning and navigation in dynamic graphs. We also develop an anytime replanning algorithm, Anytime Truncated D* (ATD*), that combines the inflated heuristic search with truncation, in an anytime manner. We discuss the theoretical properties of these algorithms proving their correctness and efficiency, and present experimental results on 2D and 3D (x, y, heading) path planning domains evaluating their performance. The empirical results show that the truncated incremental searches can provide significant improvement in runtime over existing incremental search algorithms, especially when searching for close-to-optimal solutions in large, dynamic graphs.","date":"2016-05-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370216000163","accessDate":"2022-07-18T11:04:59Z","volume":"234","pages":"49-77","publicationTitle":"Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.artint.2016.01.009","journalAbbreviation":"Artificial Intelligence","ISSN":"0004-3702","creators":[{"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Aine","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Anytime planning","type":1},{"tag":"Anytime search","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic search","type":1},{"tag":"Incremental search","type":1},{"tag":"Replanning","type":1}],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T11:04:59Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T11:04:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FWSAAY25","itemID":1011,"attachments":[{"key":"JVWSZ53L","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370216000163/pdfft?md5=fc019577897727ee8a8a42ea39880e31&pid=1-s2.0-S0004370216000163-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y","accessDate":"2022-07-18T11:05:00Z","parentItem":"FWSAAY25","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Aine and Likhachev - 2016 - Truncated incremental search.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T11:05:00Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T11:05:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JVWSZ53L","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JVWSZ53L/Aine and Likhachev - 2016 - Truncated incremental search.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1012/Aine and Likhachev - 2016 - Truncated incremental search.pdf"},{"key":"7WABHVTV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370216000163?via%3Dihub","accessDate":"2022-07-18T11:06:01Z","parentItem":"FWSAAY25","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0004370216000163.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T11:06:01Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T11:06:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7WABHVTV","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/7WABHVTV/S0004370216000163.html","defaultPath":"files/1013/S0004370216000163.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762355,"version":0},"$loki":1058},{"itemID":1457,"item":{"key":"FYWRSRLB","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Coordination-free Multi-robot Path Planning for Congestion Reduction Using Topological Reasoning","abstractNote":"We consider the problem of multi-robot path planning in a complex, cluttered environment with the aim of reducing overall congestion in the environment, while avoiding any inter-robot communication or coordination. Such limitations may exist due to lack of communication or due to privacy restrictions (for example, autonomous vehicles may not want to share their locations or intents with other vehicles or even to a central server). The key insight that allows us to solve this problem is to stochastically distribute the robots across different routes in the environment by assigning them paths in different topologically distinct classes, so as to lower congestion and the overall travel time for all robots in the environment. We outline the computation of topologically distinct paths in a spatio-temporal configuration space and propose methods for the stochastic assignment of paths to the robots. A fast replanning algorithm and a potential field based controller allow robots to avoid collision with nearby agents while following the assigned path. Our simulation and experiment results show a significant advantage over shortest path following under such a coordination-free setup.","date":"2022-05-02","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00955","accessDate":"2022-10-06T06:09:47Z","extra":"arXiv:2205.00955 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2205.00955","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:2205.00955","creators":[{"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alp","lastName":"Sahin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:09:47Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:10:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FYWRSRLB","itemID":1457,"attachments":[{"key":"2LM4WHQJ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00955.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-06T06:09:56Z","parentItem":"FYWRSRLB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2022 - Coordination-free Multi-robot Path Planning for Co.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:09:56Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:09:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2LM4WHQJ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2LM4WHQJ/Wang et al. - 2022 - Coordination-free Multi-robot Path Planning for Co.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1459/Wang et al. - 2022 - Coordination-free Multi-robot Path Planning for Co.pdf"},{"key":"2SEDHSV9","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00955","accessDate":"2022-10-06T06:10:01Z","parentItem":"FYWRSRLB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2205.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:10:01Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:10:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2SEDHSV9","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2SEDHSV9/2205.html","defaultPath":"files/1460/2205.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"2MKA7IQU","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"FYWRSRLB","note":"Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:09:47Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:09:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2MKA7IQU"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762356,"version":0},"$loki":1059},{"itemID":1263,"item":{"key":"GIL4NYJU","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Topological trajectory classification with filtrations of simplicial complexes and persistent homology","abstractNote":"In this work, we present a sampling-based approach to trajectory classification which enables automated high-level reasoning about topological classes of trajectories. Our approach is applicable to general configuration spaces and relies only on the availability of collision free samples. Unlike previous sampling-based approaches in robotics which use graphs to capture information about the path-connectedness of a configuration space, we construct a multiscale approximation of neighborhoods of the collision free configurations based on filtrations of simplicial complexes. Our approach thereby extracts additional homological information which is essential for a topological trajectory classification. We propose a multiscale classification algorithm for trajectories in configuration spaces of arbitrary dimension and for sets of trajectories starting and ending in two fixed points. Using a cone construction, we then generalize this approach to classify sets of trajectories even when trajectory start and end points are allowed to vary in path-connected subsets. We furthermore show how an augmented filtration of simplicial complexes based on an arbitrary function on the configuration space, such as a costmap, can be defined to incorporate additional constraints. We present an evaluation of our approach in 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-dimensional configuration spaces in simulation and in real-world experiments using a Baxter robot and motion capture data.","date":"01/2016","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364915586713","accessDate":"2022-08-18T09:04:45Z","volume":"35","pages":"204-223","publicationTitle":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","DOI":"10.1177/0278364915586713","issue":"1-3","journalAbbreviation":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","ISSN":"0278-3649, 1741-3176","creators":[{"firstName":"Florian T.","lastName":"Pokorny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Majd","lastName":"Hawasly","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Subramanian","lastName":"Ramamoorthy","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-18T09:04:45Z","dateModified":"2022-08-18T09:04:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GIL4NYJU","itemID":1263,"attachments":[{"key":"JDN3I8IL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pokorny et al. - 2016 - Topological trajectory classification with filtrat.pdf","url":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.967.3982&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-18T09:04:42Z","parentItem":"GIL4NYJU","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pokorny et al. - 2016 - Topological trajectory classification with filtrat.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-18T09:04:42Z","dateModified":"2022-08-18T09:04:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JDN3I8IL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JDN3I8IL/Pokorny et al. - 2016 - Topological trajectory classification with filtrat.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1262/Pokorny et al. - 2016 - Topological trajectory classification with filtrat.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762357,"version":0},"$loki":1060},{"itemID":1518,"item":{"key":"GNL9PBRD","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Image De-raining Using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network","abstractNote":"Severe weather conditions such as rain and snow adversely affect the visual quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator. This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance.","date":"2019-06-02","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05957","accessDate":"2022-10-14T10:09:18Z","extra":"arXiv:1701.05957 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1701.05957","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:1701.05957","creators":[{"firstName":"He","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vishwanath","lastName":"Sindagi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vishal M.","lastName":"Patel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-14T10:09:18Z","dateModified":"2022-10-14T10:09:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GNL9PBRD","itemID":1518,"attachments":[{"key":"JEH8GCYI","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05957.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-14T10:09:24Z","parentItem":"GNL9PBRD","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang et al. - 2019 - Image De-raining Using a Conditional Generative Ad.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-14T10:09:24Z","dateModified":"2022-10-14T10:09:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JEH8GCYI","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JEH8GCYI/Zhang et al. - 2019 - Image De-raining Using a Conditional Generative Ad.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1519/Zhang et al. - 2019 - Image De-raining Using a Conditional Generative Ad.pdf"},{"key":"527DY9EL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05957","accessDate":"2022-10-14T10:09:29Z","parentItem":"GNL9PBRD","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1701.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-14T10:09:29Z","dateModified":"2022-10-14T10:09:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/527DY9EL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/527DY9EL/1701.html","defaultPath":"files/1520/1701.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762358,"version":0},"$loki":1061},{"itemID":1391,"item":{"key":"GPCU6UT4","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Topological complexity of collision free motion planning algorithms in the presence of multiple moving obstacles","abstractNote":"We study motion planning algorithms for collision free control of multiple objects in the presence of moving obstacles.

Rather, we compute a conservative local bound on the position or trajectory of each obstacle over a short time and use the bound to compute a collision-free trajectory for the robot in an incremental manner. Moreover, we interleave planning and execution of the robot in an adaptive manner to balance between the planning horizon and responsiveness to obstacle. We highlight the performance of our planner in a simulated dynamic environment with the 7-DOF PR2 robot arm and dynamic obstacles.","date":"June 25, 2012","shortTitle":"ITOMP","libraryCatalog":"ACM Digital Library","accessDate":"2022-05-23","place":"Atibaia, S√£o Paulo, Brazil","publisher":"AAAI Press","pages":"207‚Äì215","series":"ICAPS'12","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Conference on International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling","creators":[{"firstName":"Chonhyon","lastName":"Park","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Manocha","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["CAZPYGI7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T11:19:06Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T11:19:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GU5KN44N","itemID":523,"attachments":[{"key":"2MHKNK7P","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Park et al. - 2012 - ITOMP incremental trajectory optimization for rea.pdf","parentItem":"GU5KN44N","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Park et al. - 2012 - ITOMP incremental trajectory optimization for rea.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T11:19:32Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T11:19:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2MHKNK7P","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2MHKNK7P/Park et al. - 2012 - ITOMP incremental trajectory optimization for rea.pdf","defaultPath":"files/524/Park et al. - 2012 - ITOMP incremental trajectory optimization for rea.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762360,"version":0},"$loki":1064},{"itemID":433,"item":{"key":"GUQYRIWE","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"ReViewNet: A Fast and Resource Optimized Network for Enabling Safe Autonomous Driving in Hazy Weather Conditions","abstractNote":"Adverse weather conditions such as fog, haze, snow, mist and glare create visibility problems for applications of autonomous vehicles. To ensure safe and smooth operations in frequent bad weather scenarios, image dehazing is crucial to any vehicular motion and navigation task on road or air. Moreover, the commonly deployed mobile systems are resource constrained in nature. Therefore, it is important to ensure memory, compute and run-time efficiency of dehazing algorithms. In this manuscript we propose ReViewNet, a fast, lightweight and robust dehazing system suitable for autonomous vehicles. The network uses components like spatial feature pooling, quadruple color-cue, multi-look architecture and multi-weighted loss to effectively dehaze images captured by cameras of autonomous vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed model is analyzed by exhaustive quantitative evaluation on five benchmark datasets demonstrating its supremacy over other existing state-of-the-art methods. Further, a component-wise ablation and loss weight ratio analysis demonstrates the contribution of each and every component of the network. We also show the qualitative analysis with special use cases and visual responses on distinctive vehicular vision instances, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed method in numerous hazy weather conditions for autonomous vehicular applications.","date":"2021-07","shortTitle":"ReViewNet","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","volume":"22","pages":"4256-4266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TITS.2020.3013099","issue":"7","ISSN":"1558-0016","creators":[{"firstName":"Aryan","lastName":"Mehra","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Murari","lastName":"Mandal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Narang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Chamola","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"deep learning","type":1},{"tag":"Task analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Atmospheric modeling","type":1},{"tag":"dehazing","type":1},{"tag":"Image color analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Scattering","type":1},{"tag":"Autonomous vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Gallium nitride","type":1},{"tag":"adverse weather","type":1},{"tag":"lightweight","type":1},{"tag":"Meteorology","type":1},{"tag":"resource-efficient","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicular vision","type":1}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-13T12:48:54Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T13:49:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GUQYRIWE","itemID":433,"attachments":[{"key":"5QAQ2JAF","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9167446?arnumber=9167446","accessDate":"2022-05-13T12:49:23Z","parentItem":"GUQYRIWE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9167446.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-13T12:49:23Z","dateModified":"2022-05-13T12:49:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5QAQ2JAF","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/5QAQ2JAF/9167446.html","defaultPath":"files/435/9167446.html"},{"key":"J59QH7ZV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9167446&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTE2NzQ0Ng==","accessDate":"2022-05-13T12:49:05Z","parentItem":"GUQYRIWE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mehra et al. - 2021 - ReViewNet A Fast and Resource Optimized Network f.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-13T12:49:05Z","dateModified":"2022-05-13T12:49:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/J59QH7ZV","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/J59QH7ZV/Mehra et al. - 2021 - ReViewNet A Fast and Resource Optimized Network f.pdf","defaultPath":"files/434/Mehra et al. - 2021 - ReViewNet A Fast and Resource Optimized Network f.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762361,"version":0},"$loki":1065},{"itemID":47,"item":{"key":"GVDK5H4X","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Simultaneous localization and mapping: part I","abstractNote":"This paper describes the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem and the essential methods for solving the SLAM problem and summarizes key implementations and demonstrations of the method.

To assess the effect of heuristic functions for path planning algorithms, four commonly used heuristic functions of Manhattan distance, diagonal distance, Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance are used based on three simulation environments with different map size and complexity. Experimental results show that the heuristic function significantly affects the computing performance and the final path of path planning algorithms, and Manhattan distance is the most efficiency heuristic function for all the four path planning algorithms. We apply A*, D*, LPA* and D* Lite algorithms to static and dynamic environments, respectively with different map size and complexity. We find that A* has the best performance in relatively simple static environments. When the map size and complexity of the static environment is highly increased, D* Lite is the best choice. In contrast, D* Lite has the best performance for path planning in dynamic environments. However, we also find that A* also has an excellent performance in dynamic environments when the map size and complexity are decreased.","date":"2020","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","place":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","ISBN":"978-3-030-52249-0","pages":"581-598","series":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","proceedingsTitle":"Intelligent Computing","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-52249-0_39","creators":[{"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tianxiang","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Zhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Yue","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Shi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Arai","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Supriya","lastName":"Kapoor","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Bhatia","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"A*","type":1},{"tag":"D*","type":1},{"tag":"D* Lite","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic function","type":1},{"tag":"LPA*","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning performance","type":1}],"collections":["XEGDLIT3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T15:48:58Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T13:24:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GXJBDMRA","itemID":1033,"attachments":[{"key":"CF2LE4BK","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-52249-0_39.pdf","accessDate":"2022-07-28T15:48:59Z","parentItem":"GXJBDMRA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yan et al. - 2020 - A Comprehensive Survey and Analysis on Path Planni.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T15:48:59Z","dateModified":"2022-07-28T15:48:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/CF2LE4BK","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/CF2LE4BK/Yan et al. - 2020 - A Comprehensive Survey and Analysis on Path Planni.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1034/Yan et al. - 2020 - A Comprehensive Survey and Analysis on Path Planni.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762363,"version":0},"$loki":1068},{"itemID":1435,"item":{"key":"H8G95HCK","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Computing homotopic shortest paths in the plane","abstractNote":"We address the problem of computing homotopic shortest paths in presence of obstacles in the plane.

This is particularly evident when the motion is repeated multiple times with only a limited amount of variation between each run. To address this issue, we propose the DRMconnect algorithm, a combination of dynamic reachability maps (DRM) with lazy collision checking and a fallback strategy based on the RRT-connect algorithm which is used to repair the roadmap through further exploration. This fallback allows us to use much sparser roadmaps. Furthermore, we investigate using an approximate Reeb graph to capture the topologypersistent features of the past solutions of the problem utilising this sparsity. We evaluate DRM-connect with a Reeb graph on reaching tasks, and we compare it to state-of-the-art methods. We show that the proposed method outperforms both RRTconnect and BKPIECE algorithms in the number of collision checks required and we show that our method has the potential to scale to systems with higher number degrees of freedom.","date":"10/2018","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8593879/","accessDate":"2022-10-06T05:19:32Z","place":"Madrid","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-5386-8094-0","pages":"6512-6517","proceedingsTitle":"2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS.2018.8593879","creators":[{"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Fisher","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Rosman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Ivan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üîñ"}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T05:19:32Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T05:19:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/HINDPU6G","itemID":1456,"attachments":[{"key":"QL669939","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Fisher et al. - 2018 - Real-Time Motion Planning in Changing Environments.pdf","url":"https://www.raillab.org/content/real-time-motion.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-06T05:19:29Z","parentItem":"HINDPU6G","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Fisher et al. - 2018 - Real-Time Motion Planning in Changing Environments.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T05:19:29Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T05:19:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QL669939","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/QL669939/Fisher et al. - 2018 - Real-Time Motion Planning in Changing Environments.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1455/Fisher et al. - 2018 - Real-Time Motion Planning in Changing Environments.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762365,"version":0},"$loki":1072},{"itemID":1008,"item":{"key":"HN5LYCFQ","version":0,"itemType":"document","title":"Heuristic Search Comes of Age","abstractNote":"In looking back on the last five to ten years of work in heuristic search a few trends emerge.

For systems that are well-represented by a fully known linear Gaussian state space (SS) model, the celebrated Kalman filter (KF) is a low complexity optimal solution. However, both linearity of the underlying SS model and accurate knowledge of it are often not encountered in practice. Here, we present KalmanNet, a real-time state estimator that learns from data to carry out Kalman filtering under non-linear dynamics with partial information. By incorporating the structural SS model with a dedicated recurrent neural network module in the flow of the KF, we retain data efficiency and interpretability of the classic algorithm while implicitly learning complex dynamics from data. We demonstrate numerically that KalmanNet overcomes non-linearities and model mismatch, outperforming classic filtering methods operating with both mismatched and accurate domain knowledge.","date":"2022","shortTitle":"KalmanNet","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10043","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:45:34Z","extra":"arXiv: 2107.10043","volume":"70","pages":"1532-1547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","DOI":"10.1109/TSP.2022.3158588","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans.

The key contributions of FlightGoggles are twofold. First, FlightGoggles provides photorealistic exteroceptive sensor simulation using graphics assets generated with photogrammetry. Second, it provides the ability to combine (i) synthetic exteroceptive measurements generated in silico in real time and (ii) vehicle dynamics and proprioceptive measurements generated in motio by vehicle(s) in flight in a motion-capture facility. FlightGoggles is capable of simulating a virtual-reality environment around autonomous vehicle(s) in flight. While a vehicle is in flight in the Flight-Goggles virtual reality environment, exteroceptive sensors are rendered synthetically in real time while all complex dynamics are generated organically through natural interactions of the vehicle. The FlightGoggles framework allows for researchers to accelerate development by circumventing the need to estimate complex and hard-to-model interactions such as aerodynamics, motor mechanics, battery electrochemistry, and behavior of other agents. The ability to perform vehicle-in-the-loop experiments with photorealistic exteroceptive sensor simulation facilitates novel research directions involving, e.g., fast and agile autonomous flight in obstacle-rich environments, safe human interaction, and flexible sensor selection. FlightGoggles has been utilized as the main test for selecting nine teams that will advance in the AlphaPilot autonomous drone racing challenge. We survey approaches and results from the top AlphaPilot teams, which may be of independent interest.

UAVs with this capability have begun to emerge in the literature with advances in lightweight sensing and computing. Although the planning methodologies vary from platform to platform, many algorithms adopt a hierarchical planning architecture where a slow, low-fidelity global planner guides a fast, high-fidelity local planner. However, in unknown environments, this approach can lead to erratic or unstable behavior due to the interaction between the global planner, whose solution is changing constantly, and the local planner; a consequence of not capturing higher-order dynamics in the global plan. This work proposes a planning framework in which multi-fidelity models are used to reduce the discrepancy between the local and global planner. Our approach uses high-, medium-, and low-fidelity models to compose a path that captures higher-order dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. In addition, we address the interaction between a fast planner and a slower mapper by considering the sensor data not yet fused into the map during the collision check. This novel mapping and planning framework for agile flights is validated in simulation and hardware experiments, showing replanning times of 5-40 ms in cluttered environments.","date":"2019-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2577-087X","pages":"725-731","proceedingsTitle":"2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","conferenceName":"2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794248","creators":[{"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"Tordesillas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brett T.","lastName":"Lopez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Carter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Ware","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan P.","lastName":"How","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Robot sensing systems","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Computational modeling","type":1},{"tag":"üî•"}],"collections":[],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IZ5U58PN"]},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T08:27:35Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T08:29:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/HZBYPNWX","itemID":681,"attachments":[{"key":"ISW73KJ2","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://undefined/document/8794248?arnumber=8794248","accessDate":"2022-06-08T08:28:03Z","parentItem":"HZBYPNWX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8794248.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T08:28:03Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T08:28:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ISW73KJ2","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/ISW73KJ2/8794248.html","defaultPath":"files/684/8794248.html"},{"key":"4ZWQMNUQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://undefined/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8794248&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9ODc5NDI0OA==","accessDate":"2022-06-08T08:27:43Z","parentItem":"HZBYPNWX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Tordesillas et al. - 2019 - Real-Time Planning with Multi-Fidelity Models for .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T08:27:43Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T08:27:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/4ZWQMNUQ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/4ZWQMNUQ/Tordesillas et al. - 2019 - Real-Time Planning with Multi-Fidelity Models for .pdf","defaultPath":"files/683/Tordesillas et al. - 2019 - Real-Time Planning with Multi-Fidelity Models for .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762369,"version":0},"$loki":1077},{"itemID":456,"item":{"key":"I8P682FX","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"DSVP: Dual-Stage Viewpoint Planner for Rapid Exploration by Dynamic Expansion","abstractNote":"We present a method for efficiently exploring highly convoluted environments.

Metric clustering methods, based on a distance measure, require quadratic time to compute a pairwise distance matrix and do not naturally distinguish topologically distinct trajectories. This paper presents an algorithm for topological clustering based on relative persistent homology, which, for a fixed underlying simplicial representation and discretization of trajectories, requires only linear time in the number of trajectories. The algorithm incorporates global constraints formalized in terms of the topology of sublevel or superlevel sets of a function and can be extended to incorporate probabilistic motion models. In experiments with real automobile and ship GPS trajectories as well as pedestrian trajectories extracted from video, the algorithm clusters trajectories into meaningful consistent subsets and, as we show in an experiment with ship trajectories, results in a faster and more efficient clustering than a metric clustering by Fr√©chet distance.","date":"2016-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"16-23","proceedingsTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","conferenceName":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487092","creators":[{"firstName":"Florian T.","lastName":"Pokorny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Danica","lastName":"Kragic","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"Global Positioning System","type":1},{"tag":"Measurement","type":1},{"tag":"Topology","type":1},{"tag":"Probabilistic logic","type":1},{"tag":"Clustering algorithms","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-09T05:17:13Z","dateModified":"2022-09-09T05:17:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IBDHRYL9","itemID":1363,"attachments":[{"key":"IB6JVLHK","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487092","accessDate":"2022-09-09T05:17:54Z","parentItem":"IBDHRYL9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7487092.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-09T05:17:54Z","dateModified":"2022-09-09T05:17:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IB6JVLHK","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/IB6JVLHK/7487092.html","defaultPath":"files/1365/7487092.html"},{"key":"IQL6ZSYU","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487092&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50Lzc0ODcwOTI=","accessDate":"2022-09-09T05:17:19Z","parentItem":"IBDHRYL9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pokorny et al. -

The novelty of the proposed work is that the algorithm ensures a smooth path generation for both the collision avoidance and re-planning maneuvers for the quadrotor with very low tracking error, including optimality in path length.

However, planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is still computationally challenging because it requires adding time as an additional dimension to the search-space explored by the planner. In order to avoid the increase in the dimensionality of the planning problem, most real-time approaches to path planning treat dynamic obstacles as static and constantly re-plan as dynamic obstacles move. Although gaining efÔ¨Åciency, these approaches sacriÔ¨Åce optimality and even completeness. In this paper, we develop a planner that builds on the observation that while the number of safe timesteps in any conÔ¨Åguration may be unbounded, the number of safe time intervals in a conÔ¨Åguration is Ô¨Ånite and generally very small. A safe interval is a time period for a conÔ¨Åguration with no collisions and if it were extended one timestep in either direction, it would then be in collision. The planner exploits this observation and constructs a search-space with states deÔ¨Åned by their conÔ¨Åguration and safe interval, resulting in a graph that generally only has a few states per conÔ¨Åguration. On the theoretical side, we show that our planner can provide the same optimality and completeness guarantees as planning with time as an additional dimension. On the experimental side, in simulation tests with up to 200 dynamic obstacles, we show that our planner is signiÔ¨Åcantly faster, making it feasible to use in real-time on robots operating in large dynamic environments. We also ran several real robot trials on the PR2, a mobile manipulation platform.","date":"05/2011","language":"en","shortTitle":"SIPP","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5980306/","accessDate":"2022-10-28T06:28:56Z","place":"Shanghai, China","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-61284-386-5","pages":"5628-5635","proceedingsTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","conferenceName":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980306","creators":[{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Phillips","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PR9LQ92F"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-28T06:28:56Z","dateModified":"2022-10-28T06:28:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IU9N3GWH","itemID":1552,"attachments":[{"key":"JFTHHLAQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Phillips and Likhachev - 2011 - SIPP Safe interval path planning for dynamic envi.pdf","url":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/files/sipp_icra11.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-28T06:28:54Z","parentItem":"IU9N3GWH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Phillips and Likhachev - 2011 - SIPP Safe interval path planning for dynamic envi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-28T06:28:54Z","dateModified":"2022-10-28T06:28:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JFTHHLAQ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JFTHHLAQ/Phillips and Likhachev - 2011 - SIPP Safe interval path planning for dynamic envi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1551/Phillips and Likhachev - 2011 - SIPP Safe interval path planning for dynamic envi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762373,"version":0},"$loki":1083},{"itemID":1326,"item":{"key":"IWAS4APM","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Path planning for a tethered robot using Multi-Heuristic A with topology-based heuristics","abstractNote":"In this paper, we solve the path planning problem for a tethered mobile robot, which is connected to a fixed base by a cable of length L. The reachable space of the robot is restricted by the length of the cable and obstacles. The reachable space of the tethered robot can be computed by considering the topology class of the cable. However, it is computationally too expensive to compute this space a-priori. Instead, in this paper, we show how we can plan using a recently-developed variant of A* search, called Multi-Heuristic A*. Normally, the Multi-Heuristic A* algorithm takes in a fixed set of heuristic functions. In our problem, however, the heuristics represent length of paths to the goal along different topology classes, and there can be too many of them and not all the topology classes are useful. To deal with this, we adapt Multi-Heuristic A* to work with a dynamically generated set of heuristic functions. It starts out as a normal weighted A*. Whenever the search gets trapped in a local minimum, we find the proper topology class of the path to escape from it and add the corresponding new heuristic function into the set of heuristic functions considered by the search. We present experimental analysis comparing our approach with weighted A* on planning for a tethered robot in simulation.","date":"2015-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"4656-4663","proceedingsTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7354040","creators":[{"firstName":"Soonkyum","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Mobile robots","type":1},{"tag":"Robot sensing systems","type":1},{"tag":"Topology","type":1},{"tag":"Joining processes","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-26T11:48:59Z","dateModified":"2022-08-26T11:48:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IWAS4APM","itemID":1326,"attachments":[{"key":"GIDM7IGH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7354040","accessDate":"2022-08-26T11:49:39Z","parentItem":"IWAS4APM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7354040.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-26T11:49:39Z","dateModified":"2022-08-26T11:49:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GIDM7IGH","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/GIDM7IGH/7354040.html","defaultPath":"files/1328/7354040.html"},{"key":"SRVS78A2","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354040&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50LzczNTQwNDA=","accessDate":"2022-08-26T11:49:02Z","parentItem":"IWAS4APM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kim and Likhachev - 2015 - Path planning for a tethered robot using Multi-Heu.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-26T11:49:02Z","dateModified":"2022-08-26T11:49:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SRVS78A2","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SRVS78A2/Kim and Likhachev - 2015 - Path planning for a tethered robot using Multi-Heu.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1327/Kim and Likhachev - 2015 - Path planning for a tethered robot using Multi-Heu.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762374,"version":0},"$loki":1084},{"itemID":679,"item":{"key":"IZ5U58PN","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"FASTER: Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Flights in Unknown Environments","abstractNote":"High-speed trajectory planning through unknown environments requires algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times while maintaining safety as new information about the operating environment is obtained. The requirement of computational tractability typically leads to optimization problems that do not include the obstacle constraints (collision checks are done on the solutions) or use a convex decomposition of the free space and then impose an ad-hoc time allocation scheme for each interval of the trajectory. Moreover, safety guarantees are usually obtained by having a local planner that plans a trajectory with a final ‚Äústop‚Äù condition in the freeknown space. However, these two decisions typically lead to slow and conservative trajectories. We propose FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to overcome these issues. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety guarantees are ensured by always having a feasible, safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space at the start of each replanning step. Furthermore, we present a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program formulation in which the solver can choose the trajectory interval allocation, and where a time allocation heuristic is computed efficiently using the result of the previous replanning iteration. This proposed algorithm is tested extensively both in simulation and in real hardware, showing agile flights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 3.6 m/s.","date":"2019-11","shortTitle":"FASTER","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"1934-1940","proceedingsTitle":"2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968021","creators":[{"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"Tordesillas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brett T.","lastName":"Lopez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan P.","lastName":"How","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üîñ"}],"collections":[],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/HZBYPNWX","http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MJHX9DJX"]},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T08:27:22Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:47:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IZ5U58PN","itemID":679,"attachments":[{"key":"93HTFTJN","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://undefined/document/8968021?arnumber=8968021","accessDate":"2022-06-08T08:27:42Z","parentItem":"IZ5U58PN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8968021.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T08:27:42Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T08:27:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/93HTFTJN","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/93HTFTJN/8968021.html","defaultPath":"files/682/8968021.html"},{"key":"2SAMRCZ3","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://undefined/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8968021&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9ODk2ODAyMQ==","accessDate":"2022-06-08T08:27:29Z","parentItem":"IZ5U58PN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Tordesillas et al. - 2019 - FASTER Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Fligh.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T08:27:29Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T08:27:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2SAMRCZ3","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2SAMRCZ3/Tordesillas et al. - 2019 - FASTER Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Fligh.pdf","defaultPath":"files/680/Tordesillas et al. - 2019 - FASTER Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Fligh.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762375,"version":0},"$loki":1085},{"itemID":1179,"item":{"key":"J9942UCP","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Homotopy-Based Divide-and-Conquer Strategy for Optimal Trajectory Planning via Mixed-Integer Programming","abstractNote":"This paper proposes an optimal trajectory generation framework in which the global obstacle-avoidance problem is decomposed into simpler subproblems, corresponding to distinct path homotopies. In classical approaches to homotopic trajectory planning, trajectory planning and homotopy identification are performed simultaneously, leading to a substantial computational burden. The main benefit of the proposed approach is the development of a method to enumerate and explicitly represent distinct homotopy classes before trajectory planning or optimization, which allow the problem to be decomposed into simpler independent subproblems. The main contribution of the paper is twofold. The first contribution is the description of a method for utilizing existing cell-decomposition methods to enumerate and represent local trajectory generation problems that can be solved efficiently and independently. In addition, a relationship between the proposed cell-sequence representation and homotopy classes is analyzed. The second contribution is a computationally efficient novel formulation of the trajectory optimization problem within a cell sequence via mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP). Computational efficiency and increased solution richness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation studies. The proposed MIQP formulation fits into a linear model-predictive control framework with nonconvex collision-free constraints.","date":"2015-10","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Robotics","volume":"31","pages":"1101-1115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","DOI":"10.1109/TRO.2015.2459373","issue":"5","ISSN":"1941-0468","creators":[{"firstName":"Junghee","lastName":"Park","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sisir","lastName":"Karumanchi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Iagnemma","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"motion control","type":1},{"tag":"Computational modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Search problems","type":1},{"tag":"Mixed-integer programming (MIP)","type":1},{"tag":"model-predictive control (MPC)","type":1},{"tag":"nonholonomic motion planning","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:47:13Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:47:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/J9942UCP","itemID":1179,"attachments":[{"key":"464B6P9B","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7182335/?arnumber=7182335","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:47:23Z","parentItem":"J9942UCP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7182335.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:47:23Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:47:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/464B6P9B","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/464B6P9B/7182335.html","defaultPath":"files/1181/7182335.html"},{"key":"W6F4NKLW","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7182335&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzE4MjMzNQ==","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:47:16Z","parentItem":"J9942UCP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Park et al. - 2015 - Homotopy-Based Divide-and-Conquer Strategy for Opt.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:47:16Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:47:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/W6F4NKLW","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/W6F4NKLW/Park et al. - 2015 - Homotopy-Based Divide-and-Conquer Strategy for Opt.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1180/Park et al. - 2015 - Homotopy-Based Divide-and-Conquer Strategy for Opt.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762377,"version":0},"$loki":1086},{"itemID":1249,"item":{"key":"JA5BFRCM","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Recent Advances in Topological Path Planning","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"18","creators":[{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üîñ"}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-12T14:57:12Z","dateModified":"2022-08-17T09:02:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JA5BFRCM","itemID":1249,"attachments":[{"key":"CTND436K","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bhattacharya - Recent Advances in Topological Path Planning.pdf","url":"https://www.lehigh.edu/~sub216/TOP-WS/presentations_and_posters/Subhrajit_talk.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-12T14:57:11Z","parentItem":"JA5BFRCM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bhattacharya - Recent Advances in Topological Path Planning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-12T14:57:11Z","dateModified":"2022-08-12T14:57:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/CTND436K","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/CTND436K/Bhattacharya - Recent Advances in Topological Path Planning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1248/Bhattacharya - Recent Advances in Topological Path Planning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762378,"version":0},"$loki":1087},{"itemID":1495,"item":{"key":"JET8XRSH","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A State-of-the-Art Review on Image Synthesis With Generative Adversarial Networks","abstractNote":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved impressive results in various image synthesis tasks, and are becoming a hot topic in computer vision research because of the impressive performance they achieved in various applications.

Scene information is received using onboard sensors and communication network systems, i.e., infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navigation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implementation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature.

The goal is to address one of the most critical problems in UAV design, namely weight constraints. Therefore, in order to reduce the weight, small batteries are used which affect the flight duration and overall performance. To increase the operating time during a mission, frequent recharging is typically required. To solve this problem, an autonomous air-to-air take-off and landing on a drone carrier for recharging is proposed. The main objective of this study is to calculate the minimum time and thus the shortest maneuver route between the UAV and the drone carrier. To achieve this goal, the path planning algorithm is utilized through the closed-loop direct optimal control approach to calculate the optimal time, which is defined as a cost function. In addition to the optimization techniques, the singular perturbation technique (SPT) and the Hamiltonian are used to solve and refine the optimal control problem (OCP). Finally, the numerical simulation results in both open and closed loop are presented and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"673-678","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476875","creators":[{"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Alijani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anas","lastName":"Osman","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Three-dimensional displays","type":1},{"tag":"Robot sensing systems","type":1},{"tag":"Aerial drone carrier","type":1},{"tag":"Autonomous air-to-air landing","type":1},{"tag":"Optimal control","type":1},{"tag":"Optimal control problem (OCP)","type":1},{"tag":"Perturbation methods","type":1},{"tag":"Power demand","type":1},{"tag":"Solid modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory planning","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T08:34:21Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T08:34:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JQQYZAEG","itemID":197,"attachments":[{"key":"FLGPQJC5","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476875?arnumber=9476875","accessDate":"2022-04-21T08:34:44Z","parentItem":"JQQYZAEG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476875.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T08:34:44Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T08:34:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FLGPQJC5","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/FLGPQJC5/9476875.html","defaultPath":"files/199/9476875.html"},{"key":"QI8Q8LWL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476875&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3Njg3NQ==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T08:34:25Z","parentItem":"JQQYZAEG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alijani and Osman - 2021 - Minimum-Time Path Planning for Autonomous Landing .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T08:34:25Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T08:34:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QI8Q8LWL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/QI8Q8LWL/Alijani and Osman - 2021 - Minimum-Time Path Planning for Autonomous Landing .pdf","defaultPath":"files/198/Alijani and Osman - 2021 - Minimum-Time Path Planning for Autonomous Landing .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762391,"version":0},"$loki":1093},{"itemID":1509,"item":{"key":"JRKG8LDK","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"DesnowGAN: An Efficient Single Image Snow Removal Framework Using Cross-Resolution Lateral Connection and GANs","abstractNote":"In this paper, we present a simple, efficient, and highly modularized network architecture for single-image snow-removal.

In addition, a refinement stage based on recently introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed to further improve the visual quality of the resulting snow-removed images and make a refined image and a clean image indistinguishable by a computer vision algorithm to avoid the potential perturbations of machine interpretation.

We prove that in the worst-case, this strategy still maintains the probabilistic completeness that sampling based motion planners provide.

As one such example, this paper explores the low-light image enhancement problem, where in practice it is extremely challenging to simultaneously take a low-light and a normal-light photo of the same visual scene. We propose a highly effective unsupervised generative adversarial network, dubbed EnlightenGAN, that can be trained without low/normal-light image pairs, yet proves to generalize very well on various real-world test images. Instead of supervising the learning using ground truth data, we propose to regularize the unpaired training using the information extracted from the input itself, and benchmark a series of innovations for the low-light image enhancement problem, including a global-local discriminator structure, a self-regularized perceptual loss fusion, and attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments, our proposed approach outperforms recent methods under a variety of metrics in terms of visual quality and subjective user study. Thanks to the great flexibility brought by unpaired training, EnlightenGAN is demonstrated to be easily adaptable to enhancing real-world images from various domains.

Specifically, we consider the problem of humans and robots cooperatively searching an indoor environment in a distributed manner where we assume that each robot is equipped with sensors that are able to locate targets of interest. Rather than have humans issue explicit commands to and guide robots, we allow humans to make decisions on their own and let the robots adapt to decisions taken by the human. The main contribution of this paper is a framework in which the robots in the team respond and adapt to the behavior of the human agents in the task of exploring and clearing an indoor environment. The central idea is the assignment of robots to homotopy classes that are complementary to the classes being pursued by human agents. By the virtue of the sparse topological representation of the agent trajectories, our algorithm lends itself naturally to a distributed implementation. The framework has three advantages: it (a) ensures that robots and humans pursue different homotopy classes; (b) requires very little communication between the humans and the robots; and (c) allows robots to adapt to human movement without having to model complex human decision-making behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through a distributed implementation on a ROS (Robot Operating System) platform.","date":"2016","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","place":"Tokyo","publisher":"Springer Japan","ISBN":"978-4-431-55879-8","pages":"17-32","series":"Springer Tracts in Advanced Robotics","proceedingsTitle":"Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems","DOI":"10.1007/978-4-431-55879-8_2","creators":[{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Govindarajan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nak-Young","lastName":"Chong","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Young-Jo","lastName":"Cho","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Homotopy","type":1},{"tag":"Human-robot interaction","type":1},{"tag":"Search and rescue","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T08:03:05Z","dateModified":"2022-09-16T08:03:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/K6CGEXPE","itemID":1405,"attachments":[{"key":"EWRVSR4Y","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-4-431-55879-8_2.pdf","accessDate":"2022-09-16T08:03:07Z","parentItem":"K6CGEXPE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Govindarajan et al. - 2016 - Human-Robot Collaborative Topological Exploration .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T08:03:07Z","dateModified":"2022-09-16T08:03:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EWRVSR4Y","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/EWRVSR4Y/Govindarajan et al. - 2016 - Human-Robot Collaborative Topological Exploration .pdf","defaultPath":"files/1406/Govindarajan et al. - 2016 - Human-Robot Collaborative Topological Exploration .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762399,"version":0},"$loki":1099},{"itemID":287,"item":{"key":"K7ANMQ24","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Using Deep Neural Networks for Inverse Problems in Imaging: Beyond Analytical Methods","abstractNote":"Traditionally, analytical methods have been used to solve imaging problems such as image restoration, inpainting, and superresolution (SR). In recent years, the fields of machine and deep learning have gained a lot of momentum in solving such imaging problems, often surpassing the performance provided by analytical approaches. Unlike analytical methods for which the problem is explicitly defined and domain-knowledge carefully engineered into the solution, deep neural networks (DNNs) do not benefit from such prior knowledge and instead make use of large data sets to learn the unknown solution to the inverse problem. In this article, we review deep-learning techniques for solving such inverse problems in imaging. More specifically, we review the popular neural network architectures used for imaging tasks, offering some insight as to how these deep-learning tools can solve the inverse problem. Furthermore, we address some fundamental questions, such as how deeplearning and analytical methods can be combined to provide better solutions to the inverse problem in addition to providing a discussion on the current limitations and future directions of the use of deep learning for solving inverse problem in imaging.","date":"2018-01","shortTitle":"Using Deep Neural Networks for Inverse Problems in Imaging","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","volume":"35","pages":"20-36","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","DOI":"10.1109/MSP.2017.2760358","issue":"1","ISSN":"1558-0792","creators":[{"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Lucas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Iliadis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Molina","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aggelos K.","lastName":"Katsaggelos","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"Analytical models","type":1},{"tag":"Biological neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"Image reconstruction","type":1},{"tag":"Inverse problems","type":1},{"tag":"Machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"Visual systems","type":1},{"tag":"üìö"},{"tag":"üîñ"}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T10:44:31Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T13:49:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/K7ANMQ24","itemID":287,"attachments":[{"key":"3N77FWBU","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8253590?arnumber=8253590","accessDate":"2022-04-25T10:44:42Z","parentItem":"K7ANMQ24","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8253590.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T10:44:42Z","dateModified":"2022-04-25T10:44:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/3N77FWBU","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/3N77FWBU/8253590.html","defaultPath":"files/289/8253590.html"},{"key":"GF2QBS3R","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8253590&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9ODI1MzU5MA==","accessDate":"2022-04-25T10:44:34Z","parentItem":"K7ANMQ24","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lucas et al. - 2018 - Using Deep Neural Networks for Inverse Problems in.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T10:44:34Z","dateModified":"2022-04-25T10:44:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GF2QBS3R","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/GF2QBS3R/Lucas et al. - 2018 - Using Deep Neural Networks for Inverse Problems in.pdf","defaultPath":"files/288/Lucas et al. - 2018 - Using Deep Neural Networks for Inverse Problems in.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762400,"version":0},"$loki":1100},{"itemID":1188,"item":{"key":"KE6BC2YP","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Identification and Representation of Homotopy Classes of Trajectories for Search-Based Path Planning in 3D","date":"2012","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"8","creators":[{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"üîñ"}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:50:14Z","dateModified":"2022-10-27T08:33:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KE6BC2YP","itemID":1188,"attachments":[{"key":"CHXBNZHF","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bhattacharya et al. - Identification and Representation of Homotopy Clas.pdf","url":"https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.thi.idm.oclc.org/ebooks/6276859/6301070.pdf?bkn=6276859&pdfType=chapter","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:50:13Z","parentItem":"KE6BC2YP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bhattacharya et al. - Identification and Representation of Homotopy Clas.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:50:13Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:50:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/CHXBNZHF","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/CHXBNZHF/Bhattacharya et al. - Identification and Representation of Homotopy Clas.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1187/Bhattacharya et al. - Identification and Representation of Homotopy Clas.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762400,"version":0},"$loki":1101},{"itemID":1206,"item":{"key":"KEQEJKQL","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"An Experimental Study for Optimal Homotopy Property of Motion Planning Algorithms","abstractNote":"Path Planning Problem is very hard for its huge search space.

This technique is applicable in many fields, such as penetration and remote surveillance. The learning-based controller is constructed with an actor-critic framework, and can perform a dual-channel continuous control (roll and speed) of the UAV. To overcome the fragility and volatility of original DDPG, three critical learning tricks are introduced in Robust-DDPG: (1) Delayed-learning trick, providing stable learnings, while facing dynamic environments; (2) adversarial attack trick, improving policy‚Äôs adaptability to uncertain environments; (3) mixed exploration trick, enabling faster convergence of the model. The training experiments show great improvement in its convergence speed, convergence effect, and stability. The exploiting experiments demonstrate high efficiency in providing the UAV a shorter and smoother path. While, the generalization experiments verify its better adaptability to complicated, dynamic and uncertain environments, comparing to Deep Q Network (DQN) and DDPG algorithms.","date":"2020/1","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/4/640","accessDate":"2022-05-24T11:14:31Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 4\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"12","pages":"640","publicationTitle":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs12040640","issue":"4","ISSN":"2072-4292","creators":[{"firstName":"Kaifang","lastName":"Wan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaoguang","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zijian","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"UAV","type":1},{"tag":"deep reinforcement learning","type":1},{"tag":"adversarial attack","type":1},{"tag":"delayed learning","type":1},{"tag":"mixed exploration","type":1},{"tag":"robust motion control","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:14:31Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:14:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KII47HFN","itemID":578,"attachments":[{"key":"FNCL2JK8","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/4/640/pdf?version=1582114292","accessDate":"2022-05-24T11:14:33Z","parentItem":"KII47HFN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wan et al. - 2020 - Robust Motion Control for UAV in Dynamic Uncertain.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:14:33Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:14:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FNCL2JK8","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/FNCL2JK8/Wan et al. - 2020 - Robust Motion Control for UAV in Dynamic Uncertain.pdf","defaultPath":"files/579/Wan et al. - 2020 - Robust Motion Control for UAV in Dynamic Uncertain.pdf"},{"key":"VWPMFQQQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/4/640/htm","accessDate":"2022-05-24T11:15:19Z","parentItem":"KII47HFN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"htm.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:15:19Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:15:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VWPMFQQQ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/VWPMFQQQ/htm.html","defaultPath":"files/580/htm.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762403,"version":0},"$loki":1103},{"itemID":111,"item":{"key":"KKW3EZ9R","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Aggressive flight of fixed-wing and quadrotor aircraft in dense indoor environments","abstractNote":"In this paper, we describe trajectory planning and state estimation algorithms for aggressive flight of micro aerial vehicles in known, obstacle-dense environments. Finding aggressive but dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments requires trajectory optimization and state estimation in the full state space of the vehicle, which is usually computationally infeasible on realistic timescales for real vehicles and sensors. We first build on previous work of van Nieuwstadt and Murray and Mellinger and Kumar, to show how a search process can be coupled with optimization in the output space of a differentially flat vehicle model to find aggressive trajectories that utilize the full maneuvering capabilities of a quadrotor. We further extend this work to vehicles with complex, Dubins-type dynamics and present a novel trajectory representation called a ‚ÄúDubins‚ÄìPolynomial trajectory‚Äù, which allows us to optimize trajectories for fixed-wing vehicles. To provide accurate state estimation for aggressive flight, we show how the Gaussian particle filter can be extended to allow laser rangefinder localization to be combined with a Kalman filter. This formulation allows similar estimation accuracy to particle filtering in the full vehicle state but with an order of magnitude more efficiency. We conclude with experiments demonstrating the execution of quadrotor and fixed-wing trajectories in cluttered environments. We show results of aggressive flight at speeds of up to 8‚Äâm/s for the quadrotor and 11‚Äâm/s for the fixed-wing aircraft.","date":"2015-06-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"SAGE Journals","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0278364914558129","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:34:41Z","extra":"Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd STM","volume":"34","pages":"969-1002","publicationTitle":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","DOI":"10.1177/0278364914558129","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","ISSN":"0278-3649","creators":[{"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Bry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Richter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Bachrach","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Roy","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"localization","type":1},{"tag":"aerial robotics","type":1},{"tag":"design and control","type":1},{"tag":"field and service robotics","type":1},{"tag":"mechanics","type":1},{"tag":"mobile and distributed robotics SLAM","type":1},{"tag":"motion control","type":1},{"tag":"Non-holonomic motion planning","type":1},{"tag":"sensing and perception computer vision","type":1},{"tag":"sensor fusion","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:34:41Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:34:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KKW3EZ9R","itemID":111,"attachments":[{"key":"J7CBI7C5","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Submitted Version","url":"https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/106948/1/Roy_Aggresive%20flight.pdf","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:34:44Z","parentItem":"KKW3EZ9R","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bry et al. - 2015 - Aggressive flight of fixed-wing and quadrotor airc.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:34:44Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:34:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/J7CBI7C5","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/J7CBI7C5/Bry et al. - 2015 - Aggressive flight of fixed-wing and quadrotor airc.pdf","defaultPath":"files/112/Bry et al. - 2015 - Aggressive flight of fixed-wing and quadrotor airc.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762404,"version":0},"$loki":1104},{"itemID":1490,"item":{"key":"KMRHWQ8L","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Survey on Rain Removal from Video and Single Image","abstractNote":"Rain streaks might severely degenerate the performance of video/image processing tasks.

The fundamental problem which limits clear image reconstruction is the random diffusion of light in the scattering medium. Recently, the dark channel prior method has emerged as a powerful approach for haze removal under adverse weather conditions. However, this method requires high computational time, and fails to achieve haze-free image in the sky region. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel imaging method based on quadtree theory combined with transmission optimization (QTCTO) to restore the visibility of images degraded by scattering medium. The proposed method uses the quadtree theory (for region segmentation) to estimate the global atmospheric light, while the transmission in the media is estimated by coefficient modification for the dark channel. The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against scattering (under smoke and turbid water conditions) and has the advantage of low computational time. The proposed method can be used for security surveillance, remote sensing, and various military applications.","date":"2020-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Photonics Journal","volume":"12","pages":"1-13","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","DOI":"10.1109/JPHOT.2020.2988279","issue":"3","ISSN":"1943-0655","creators":[{"firstName":"Yingbo","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Cao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chengqiang","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Saad","lastName":"Rizvi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Hao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Atmospheric modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Image restoration","type":1},{"tag":"atmospheric optics","type":1},{"tag":"Channel estimation","type":1},{"tag":"Image edge detection","type":1},{"tag":"Image segmentation","type":1},{"tag":"Media","type":1},{"tag":"propagation and scattering","type":1},{"tag":"Scattering","type":1},{"tag":"turbid media","type":1},{"tag":"Visibility restoration","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T11:12:12Z","dateModified":"2022-06-07T14:51:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KQWP6MJ9","itemID":322,"attachments":[{"key":"4RDECDW2","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9072525/?arnumber=9072525","accessDate":"2022-04-25T11:12:31Z","parentItem":"KQWP6MJ9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9072525.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T11:12:31Z","dateModified":"2022-04-25T11:12:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/4RDECDW2","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/4RDECDW2/9072525.html","defaultPath":"files/324/9072525.html"},{"key":"8C4XX6ET","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/4563994/9080409/09072525.pdf?tp=&arnumber=9072525&isnumber=9080409&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTA3MjUyNQ==","accessDate":"2022-04-25T11:12:22Z","parentItem":"KQWP6MJ9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2020 - Fast Visibility Restoration Using a Single Degrada.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T11:12:22Z","dateModified":"2022-04-25T11:12:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8C4XX6ET","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8C4XX6ET/Wang et al. - 2020 - Fast Visibility Restoration Using a Single Degrada.pdf","defaultPath":"files/323/Wang et al. - 2020 - Fast Visibility Restoration Using a Single Degrada.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762406,"version":0},"$loki":1106},{"itemID":1163,"item":{"key":"KTHK4S3G","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Towards Constructing Finer then Homotopy Path Classes","abstractNote":"This work presents a new path classification criterion to distinguish paths geometrically and topologically from the workspace, which is divided through cell decomposition, generating a medial-axis-like skeleton structure.

In this paper, we present a planning algorithm intended to speed up path planning for high-dimensional state-spaces such as robotic arms. The idea behind this work is that while planning in a high-dimensional state-space is often necessary to ensure the feasibilityof the resulting path, large portions of the path have a lower-dimensional structure. Based on this observation, our algorithm iteratively constructs a state-space of an adaptive dimensionality--a state-space that is high-dimensional only where the higher dimensionality is absolutely necessary for finding a feasible path. This often reduces drastically the size of the state-space, and as a result, the planning time and memory requirements. Analytically, we show that our method is complete and is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, within a specified suboptimality bound. Experimentally, we apply the approach to 3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading), and to a 7 DOF robotic arm on the Willow Garage&rsquo;s PR2 robot. The results from our experiments suggest that ourmethod can be substantially faster than some of the state-of-the-art planning algorithms optimized for those tasks.","date":"2011","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ojs.aaai.org","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/view/18204","accessDate":"2022-07-14T13:20:28Z","rights":"Copyright (c) 2021 Proceedings of the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search","extra":"Number: 1","volume":"2","pages":"52-59","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search","issue":"1","creators":[{"firstName":"Kalin","lastName":"Gochev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Cohen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Butzke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alla","lastName":"Safonova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üîñ"},{"tag":"Heuristic Search","type":1}],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5","PR9LQ92F"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QYQSHNLH","http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VNSLIQKT"]},"dateAdded":"2022-07-14T13:20:28Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T09:40:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KUGCPDNW","itemID":974,"attachments":[{"key":"EUQU4T2H","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/download/18204/17995","accessDate":"2022-07-14T13:20:32Z","parentItem":"KUGCPDNW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gochev et al. - 2011 - Path Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-14T13:20:32Z","dateModified":"2022-07-14T13:20:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EUQU4T2H","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/EUQU4T2H/Gochev et al. - 2011 - Path Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality.pdf","defaultPath":"files/975/Gochev et al. - 2011 - Path Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762409,"version":0},"$loki":1108},{"itemID":1476,"item":{"key":"KYE4R5ZJ","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Generation of diverse paths in 3D environments","abstractNote":"In this paper we propose a deterministic algorithm to produce a set of diverse paths between a given start and goal configuration in 3D environments.

However, the generalization ability of current SID methods may still be limited in real scenario, and the deraining results also cannot effectively improve subsequent high-level tasks (e.g., object detection). The main reason may be because the current works mainly focus on designing new deraining networks, while neglecting the interpretation of the solving process. To investigate these issues, we in this paper re-examine the three factors (i.e.,data, rain model and network architecture) for the SID task, and speciÔ¨Åcally analyze them by proposing new and more reasonable criteria (i.e., general vs. speciÔ¨Åc, synthetical vs. mathematical, black-box vs. whitebox). We will also study the relationship of the three factors from new perspectives of data, and reveal two different solving paradigms (explicit vs. implicit) for SID. We further discuss the properties of the data-driven SID methods from Ô¨Åve aspects, i.e., training strategy, network pipeline, domain knowledge, data preprocessing and objective function, with some useful conclusions provided by statistics. Besides, we also profoundly studied one of the three factors, i.e., data, and measured the performance of current methods on different datasets via extensive experiments to reveal the effectiveness of SID data. Finally, with the above comprehensive review and in-depth analysis, we also draw some instructive conclusions and valuable suggestions for the future research in this Ô¨Åeld.","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shuicheng","lastName":"Yan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üìö"}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-13T11:13:29Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T11:18:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KZYADULP","itemID":1486,"attachments":[{"key":"R5LBYMV8","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zhang et al. - Data-Driven Single Image Deraining A Comprehensiv.pdf","url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/04a7/1863ae18f82b123da96402e3631927431839.pdf?_ga=2.197351082.441564131.1665659316-1235560790.1655799763","accessDate":"2022-10-13T11:13:28Z","parentItem":"KZYADULP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang et al. - Data-Driven Single Image Deraining A Comprehensiv.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-13T11:13:28Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T11:13:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/R5LBYMV8","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/R5LBYMV8/Zhang et al. - Data-Driven Single Image Deraining A Comprehensiv.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1485/Zhang et al. - Data-Driven Single Image Deraining A Comprehensiv.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762413,"version":0},"$loki":1112},{"itemID":606,"item":{"key":"L5UFTKHU","version":0,"itemType":"bookSection","title":"Literature Survey: Trajectory Generation in and Control of Robotic Systems","abstractNote":"This work spans and combines a wide range of research topics.

In the standard formulation, a generalized plan is a mapping from feature or observation histories into actions, assuming that the instances share a common pool of features and actions. This assumption, however, excludes the standard relational planning domains where actions and objects change across instances. In this work, we extend the standard formulation of generalized planning to such domains. This is achieved by projecting the actions over the features, resulting in a common set of abstract actions which can be tested for soundness and completeness, and which can be used for generating general policies such as ‚Äúif the gripper is empty, pick the clear block above x and place it on the table‚Äù that achieve the goal clear(x) in any Blocksworld instance. In this policy, ‚Äúpick the clear block above x‚Äù is an abstract action that may represent the action Unstack(a, b) in one situation and the action Unstack(b, c) in another. Transformations are also introduced for computing such policies by means of fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planners. The value of generalized representations for learning general policies is also discussed.","date":"7/2018","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/649","accessDate":"2022-06-27T12:41:28Z","place":"Stockholm, Sweden","publisher":"International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization","ISBN":"978-0-9992411-2-7","pages":"4667-4673","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence","conferenceName":"Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence {IJCAI-18}","DOI":"10.24963/ijcai.2018/649","creators":[{"firstName":"Blai","lastName":"Bonet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hector","lastName":"Geffner","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-27T12:41:28Z","dateModified":"2022-06-27T12:41:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/L7T9KK6R","itemID":897,"attachments":[{"key":"72GKXLPI","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bonet and Geffner - 2018 - Features, Projections, and Representation Change f.pdf","url":"https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0649.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-27T12:41:27Z","parentItem":"L7T9KK6R","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bonet and Geffner - 2018 - Features, Projections, and Representation Change f.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-27T12:41:27Z","dateModified":"2022-06-27T12:41:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/72GKXLPI","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/72GKXLPI/Bonet and Geffner - 2018 - Features, Projections, and Representation Change f.pdf","defaultPath":"files/896/Bonet and Geffner - 2018 - Features, Projections, and Representation Change f.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762415,"version":0},"$loki":1114},{"itemID":269,"item":{"key":"L8V2RQSP","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Curvature-Constrained Vector Field for Path Following Guidance","abstractNote":"This paper introduces a new vector field guidance method to generate continuously flyable paths for unmanned air vehicles.

Considering straight line and circular paths, the asymptotic behavior of position error is shown to converge to zero. Analysis of path curvature establishes a significantly lower maximum value as compared to a popular existing method. Simulation results are presented considering a two-dimensional kinematic model of the vehicle.

The B-RRT* algorithm introduces the bidirectional search to obtain faster convergence and shorter paths. To solve the problems of path planning in complex environments with concavities, convexities, narrow channels, mazes and multiple obstacles, an adaptive extension bidirectional RRT* (AEB-RRT*) algorithm is proposed. The AEB-RRT* algorithm simultaneously extends from both the starting point and the ending point, and adaptively adjusts the sampling probability and different expansion methods according to the number of collision detection failures. After acquiring a feasible path, it is then post-processed by interpolation and the principle of triangular inequality to obtain a shorter collision-free path. And the Manhattan distance replaces the Euclidean distance to calculate the distances between nodes in order to achieve higher computational efficiency. The experimental results show that the AEB-RRT* algorithm outperforms other path planning algorithms in stronger search ability, obtaining near-optimal or best paths with high efficiency and better robustness.

Traditionally, these samples are drawn either probabilistically or deterministically to uniformly cover the state space. Yet, the motion of many robotic systems is often restricted to \"small\" regions of the state space, due to, for example, differential constraints or collision-avoidance constraints. To accelerate the planning process, it is thus desirable to devise non-uniform sampling strategies that favor sampling in those regions where an optimal solution might lie. This paper proposes a methodology for non-uniform sampling, whereby a sampling distribution is learned from demonstrations, and then used to bias sampling. The sampling distribution is computed through a conditional variational autoencoder, allowing sample generation from the latent space conditioned on the specific planning problem. This methodology is general, can be used in combination with any sampling-based planner, and can effectively exploit the underlying structure of a planning problem while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of sampling-based approaches. Specifically, on several planning problems, the proposed methodology is shown to effectively learn representations for the relevant regions of the state space, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in terms of success rate and convergence to the optimal cost.","date":"2019-03-11","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05448","accessDate":"2022-06-24T09:53:44Z","extra":"Number: arXiv:1709.05448\narXiv:1709.05448 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1709.05448","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:1709.05448","creators":[{"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Ichter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Harrison","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Pavone","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T09:53:44Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T09:53:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/LLCG9VG7","itemID":840,"attachments":[{"key":"8EIUN3AL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05448.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-24T09:53:53Z","parentItem":"LLCG9VG7","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ichter et al. - 2019 - Learning Sampling Distributions for Robot Motion P.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T09:53:53Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T09:53:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8EIUN3AL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8EIUN3AL/Ichter et al. - 2019 - Learning Sampling Distributions for Robot Motion P.pdf","defaultPath":"files/842/Ichter et al. - 2019 - Learning Sampling Distributions for Robot Motion P.pdf"},{"key":"HH4R42R2","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05448","accessDate":"2022-06-24T09:53:58Z","parentItem":"LLCG9VG7","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1709.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T09:53:58Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T09:53:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/HH4R42R2","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HH4R42R2/1709.html","defaultPath":"files/843/1709.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"SW23TDUY","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"LLCG9VG7","note":"Comment: International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2018","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T09:53:44Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T09:53:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SW23TDUY"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762421,"version":0},"$loki":1123},{"itemID":569,"item":{"key":"LMDXMUQV","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"3-D Trajectory Planning of Aerial Vehicles Using RRT*","abstractNote":"This brief presents a trajectory planning algorithm for aerial vehicles traveling in 3-D space while avoiding obstacles. The nature of the obstacles can be, for example, radar detection areas, cooperating and non-cooperating vehicles, and so on. Thus, it is a complex trajectory planning problem. The proposed planner is based on the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm. Artificial potential fields are combined with the RRT* algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed to a suboptimal solution by biasing the random state generation. The performance of this framework is demonstrated on a complex missile application in a heterogeneous environment. Indeed, since the air density decreases exponentially with altitude, the maneuverability of the aerial vehicle depending on aerodynamic forces also decreases exponentially with altitude. To face this problem, the shortest paths of Dubins-like vehicles traveling in a heterogeneous environment are used to build the metric. In the simulation results, this framework can find the first solution with fewer iterations than the RRT and the RRT* algorithm. Moreover, the final solution obtained within a given number of iterations is closer to an optimal solution regarding the considered criterion.","date":"2017-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","volume":"25","pages":"1116-1123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","DOI":"10.1109/TCST.2016.2582144","issue":"3","ISSN":"1558-0865","creators":[{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Pharpatara","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"B.","lastName":"H√©riss√©","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Y.","lastName":"Bestaoui","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Aerodynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"complex environment","type":1},{"tag":"Convergence","type":1},{"tag":"Aerial robotics","type":1},{"tag":"Missiles","type":1},{"tag":"optimal control","type":1},{"tag":"optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"path planning algorithm","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:08:55Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:08:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/LMDXMUQV","itemID":569,"attachments":[{"key":"9QSHCNT4","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7505628?arnumber=7505628","accessDate":"2022-05-24T11:09:22Z","parentItem":"LMDXMUQV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7505628.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:09:22Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:09:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9QSHCNT4","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/9QSHCNT4/7505628.html","defaultPath":"files/571/7505628.html"},{"key":"GSW9KI3B","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7505628&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzUwNTYyOA==","accessDate":"2022-05-24T11:08:58Z","parentItem":"LMDXMUQV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pharpatara et al. - 2017 - 3-D Trajectory Planning of Aerial Vehicles Using R.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T11:08:58Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T11:08:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GSW9KI3B","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/GSW9KI3B/Pharpatara et al. - 2017 - 3-D Trajectory Planning of Aerial Vehicles Using R.pdf","defaultPath":"files/570/Pharpatara et al. - 2017 - 3-D Trajectory Planning of Aerial Vehicles Using R.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762422,"version":0},"$loki":1124},{"itemID":712,"item":{"key":"LZ97TEXJ","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Search-Based Motion Planning for Aggressive Flight in SE(3)","abstractNote":"Quadrotors with large thrust-to-weight ratios are able to track aggressive trajectories with sharp turns and high accelerations. In this letter, we develop a search-based trajectory planning algorithm that exploits the quadrotor maneuverability to generate sequences of motion primitives in cluttered environments. We model the quadrotor body as an ellipsoid and compute its flight attitude along trajectories in order to check for collisions against obstacles. The ellipsoid model allows the quadrotor to pass through gaps that are smaller than its diameter with nonzero pitch or roll angles. Without any prior information about the location of gaps and associated attitude constraints, our algorithm is able to find a safe and optimal trajectory that guides the robot to its goal as fast as possible. To accelerate planning, we first perform a lower dimensional search and use it as a heuristic to guide the generation of a final dynamically feasible trajectory. We analyze critical discretization parameters of motion primitive planning and demonstrate the feasibility of the generated trajectories in various simulations and real-world experiments.","date":"2018-07","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","volume":"3","pages":"2439-2446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LRA.2018.2795654","issue":"3","ISSN":"2377-3766","creators":[{"firstName":"Sikang","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kartik","lastName":"Mohta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Atanasov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Acceleration","type":1},{"tag":"Angular velocity","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"Motion and path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"üîñ"},{"tag":"aerial systems: applications","type":1},{"tag":"autonomous vehicle navigation","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:52:46Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:53:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/LZ97TEXJ","itemID":712,"attachments":[{"key":"JBLPS38Q","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://undefined/document/8264768/?arnumber=8264768","accessDate":"2022-06-08T09:52:54Z","parentItem":"LZ97TEXJ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8264768.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:52:54Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:52:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JBLPS38Q","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JBLPS38Q/8264768.html","defaultPath":"files/714/8264768.html"},{"key":"UAYVRMRX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://undefined/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8264768&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD9hcm51bWJlcj04MjY0NzY4","accessDate":"2022-06-08T09:52:48Z","parentItem":"LZ97TEXJ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu et al. - 2018 - Search-Based Motion Planning for Aggressive Flight.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:52:48Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:52:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/UAYVRMRX","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/UAYVRMRX/Liu et al. - 2018 - Search-Based Motion Planning for Aggressive Flight.pdf","defaultPath":"files/713/Liu et al. - 2018 - Search-Based Motion Planning for Aggressive Flight.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762423,"version":0},"$loki":1125},{"itemID":1107,"item":{"key":"M2SCPGXT","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Consolidated Review of Path Planning and Optimization Techniques: Technical Perspectives and Future Directions","abstractNote":"In this paper, a review on the three most important communication techniques (ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles) has been presented that throws light on trajectory planning, its optimization, and various issues in a summarized way.

To solve the problems of poor convergence and degradation that hinder the algorithm's ability to find the best in the later stage, a dynamic feedback horizon and an adaptive step size are introduced. On the other hand, to ensure that the planned paths are continuous in both orientation and curvature, the Bessel curve theory is introduced to smooth the planned paths. This is demonstrated through a simulation that shows the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm achieving 100% planning accuracy, while ensuring the shortest average path in the same grid environment. Additionally, the smoothed path is continuous in both orientation and curvature, which satisfies the kinematic characteristics of the mobile robot.","date":"2022-01-13","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04506-y","accessDate":"2022-08-09T15:07:13Z","rights":"2022 The Author(s)","extra":"Number: 1\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"12","pages":"659","publicationTitle":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-04506-y","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Rep","ISSN":"2045-2322","creators":[{"firstName":"Fei-Fei","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Du","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ke-Jin","lastName":"Jia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computational science","type":1},{"tag":"Computer science","type":1},{"tag":"Electrical and electronic engineering","type":1}],"collections":["CAZPYGI7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T15:07:13Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T15:07:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/M65TWG7X","itemID":1100,"attachments":[{"key":"FZPWIFVY","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04506-y.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-09T15:07:14Z","parentItem":"M65TWG7X","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Li et al. - 2022 - Path planning and smoothing of mobile robot based .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T15:07:14Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T15:07:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FZPWIFVY","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/FZPWIFVY/Li et al. - 2022 - Path planning and smoothing of mobile robot based .pdf","defaultPath":"files/1101/Li et al. - 2022 - Path planning and smoothing of mobile robot based .pdf"},{"key":"WC36IMF7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04506-y","accessDate":"2022-08-09T15:07:19Z","parentItem":"M65TWG7X","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"s41598-021-04506-y.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T15:07:19Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T15:07:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WC36IMF7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WC36IMF7/s41598-021-04506-y.html","defaultPath":"files/1102/s41598-021-04506-y.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762427,"version":0},"$loki":1128},{"itemID":239,"item":{"key":"M7D7A2LX","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Exploration of Unknown Environments","abstractNote":"Autonomous exploration is an essential task for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in unknown environments. Often, UAVs on these missions must first build a map of the environment via pure exploration and subsequently use (i.e. exploit) the generated map for downstream navigation tasks. Accomplishing these navigation tasks in two separate steps is not always possible and can potentially be disadvantageous for UAVs deployed in outdoor and dynamically changing environments. Current exploration approaches typically use a priori human-generated maps or heuristics such as frontier-based exploration. Other approaches use learning but focus only on learning policies for specific tasks and use sample inefficient random exploration or make impractical assumptions about full map availability. In this paper, we develop an adaptive exploration approach that allows for a trade off between exploration and exploitation in a single step using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We specifically focus on UAVs searching for areas of interest (AoIs) in an unknown environment. The proposed approach uses a map segmentation technique to decompose the environment map into smaller, tractable maps. DDQN and A2C algorithms are extended with a stack of LSTM layers and trained to generate optimal policies for the exploration and exploitation tasks, respectively. Then, an information gain function is repeatedly computed to determine the optimal trade-off between them. We tested our approach in 3 different tasks against 4 baselines. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of navigating through randomly generated environments and covering more AoI in less time compared to the baselines.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"265-274","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476756","creators":[{"firstName":"Ashley","lastName":"Peake","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joe","lastName":"McCalmon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Myers","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sarra","lastName":"Alqahtani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Pauca","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"Task analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Reinforcement learning","type":1},{"tag":"Aircraft navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Aircraft","type":1},{"tag":"Complexity theory","type":1},{"tag":"Drones","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:05:26Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:05:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/M7D7A2LX","itemID":239,"attachments":[{"key":"CH8PSCS7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476756/?arnumber=9476756","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:05:38Z","parentItem":"M7D7A2LX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476756.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:05:38Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:05:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/CH8PSCS7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/CH8PSCS7/9476756.html","defaultPath":"files/241/9476756.html"},{"key":"VE4WHAJP","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476756&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3Njc1Ng==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:05:31Z","parentItem":"M7D7A2LX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Peake et al. - 2021 - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Explorati.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:05:31Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:05:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VE4WHAJP","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/VE4WHAJP/Peake et al. - 2021 - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Explorati.pdf","defaultPath":"files/240/Peake et al. - 2021 - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Explorati.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762428,"version":0},"$loki":1129},{"itemID":96,"item":{"key":"M9JWMF9B","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Robust Stereo Visual Inertial Odometry for Fast Autonomous Flight","abstractNote":"In recent years, vision-aided inertial odometry for state estimation has matured significantly. However, we still encounter challenges in terms of improving the computational efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithms for applications in autonomous flight with micro aerial vehicles in which it is difficult to use high quality sensors and pow- erful processors because of constraints on size and weight. In this paper, we present a filter-based stereo visual inertial odometry that uses the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) [1]. Previous work on stereo visual inertial odometry has resulted in solutions that are computationally expensive. We demonstrate that our Stereo Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (S-MSCKF) is comparable to state-of-art monocular solutions in terms of computational cost, while providing signifi- cantly greater robustness. We evaluate our S-MSCKF algorithm and compare it with state-of-art methods including OKVIS, ROVIO, and VINS-MONO on both the EuRoC dataset, and our own experimental datasets demonstrating fast autonomous flight with maximum speed of 17.5m/s in indoor and outdoor environments.

We introduce the notion of ‚Äúmeta-planning‚Äù in which a refined offline computation enables safe switching between different online planners. This provides autonomous systems with the ability to adapt motion plans to a priori unknown environments in real-time as sensor measurements detect new obstacles, and the flexibility to maneuver differently in the presence of obstacles than they would in free space, all while maintaining a strict safety guarantee.

Their ability to navigate in an environment without a need for physical or electro-mechanical guidance devices has made it more promising and useful. The use of autonomous mobile robots is emerging in different sectors such as companies, industries, hospital, institutions, agriculture and homes to improve services and daily activities. Due to technology advancement, the demand for mobile robot has increased due to the task they perform and services they render such as carrying heavy objects, monitoring, search and rescue missions, etc. Various studies have been carried out by researchers on the importance of mobile robot, its applications and challenges. This survey paper unravels the current literatures, the challenges mobile robot is being faced with. A comprehensive study on devices/sensors and prevalent sensor fusion techniques developed for tackling issues like localization, estimation and navigation in mobile robot are presented as well in which they are organised according to relevance, strengths and weaknesses.

The standard approaches that ensure safety by enforcing a ‚Äústop‚Äù condition in the free-known space can severely limit the speed of the vehicle, especially in situations where much of the world is unknown. Moreover, the ad-hoc time and interval allocation scheme usually imposed on the trajectory also leads to conservative and slower trajectories. This work proposes FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to ensure safety without sacrificing speed. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety is ensured by always having a safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space. The MIQP formulation proposed also allows the solver to choose the trajectory interval allocation. FASTER is tested extensively in simulation and in real hardware, showing flights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 7.8 m/s, and experiments at the maximum speed of a skid-steer ground robot (2 m/s).","date":"2022-04","shortTitle":"FASTER","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Robotics","volume":"38","pages":"922-938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","DOI":"10.1109/TRO.2021.3100142","issue":"2","ISSN":"1941-0468","creators":[{"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"Tordesillas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brett T.","lastName":"Lopez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Everett","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan P.","lastName":"How","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Aerospace electronics","type":1},{"tag":"Convex decomposition","type":1},{"tag":"Hardware","type":1},{"tag":"Optimization","type":1},{"tag":"path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Resource management","type":1},{"tag":"Safety","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"trajectory optimization","type":1},{"tag":"UAV","type":1},{"tag":"üîñ"}],"collections":[],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IZ5U58PN"]},"dateAdded":"2022-06-07T14:45:07Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:47:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MJHX9DJX","itemID":621,"attachments":[{"key":"4YSMC5FX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://undefined/document/9592663?arnumber=9592663","accessDate":"2022-06-07T14:45:30Z","parentItem":"MJHX9DJX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9592663.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-07T14:45:30Z","dateModified":"2022-06-07T14:45:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/4YSMC5FX","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/4YSMC5FX/9592663.html","defaultPath":"files/623/9592663.html"},{"key":"E6UGEFHA","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://undefined/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592663&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTU5MjY2Mw==","accessDate":"2022-06-07T14:45:21Z","parentItem":"MJHX9DJX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Tordesillas et al. - 2022 - FASTER Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Navig.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-07T14:45:21Z","dateModified":"2022-06-07T14:45:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/E6UGEFHA","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/E6UGEFHA/Tordesillas et al. - 2022 - FASTER Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Navig.pdf","defaultPath":"files/622/Tordesillas et al. - 2022 - FASTER Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Navig.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762432,"version":0},"$loki":1134},{"itemID":1075,"item":{"key":"MKSUFM8X","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Methodology for Path Planning and Optimization of Mobile Robots: A Review","abstractNote":"Mobile robotics research is an emerging area since last three decades. The present research on mobile robotics addresses the problems which are mainly on path planning algorithm and optimization in static as well as dynamic environments. A detailed review has been made in the broad field of mobile robotic research especially focussing on the path planning strategy in various cluttered environments, their advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies/methods have been highlighted. The path planning strategy of mobile robots can be categorised as Classical Methods and Heuristic Methods. Further subcategorized as (i) Analytical Methods, (ii) Enumerative Methods, (iii) Evolutionary Methods and (iv) Meta-Heuristic Methods. Each of these aforesaid methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, the main weakness arises from the fact that, analytical methods are too complex for intangible applications, whereas the enumerative methods are anxious by the extent of the search space. On the other hand, when search space is too large in path planning strategy, many evolutionary methods have been shown to be ineffective. To overcome these drawbacks, meta-heuristic methods have been fascinating considerably in this broad field of research. Many techniques are developed in path planning for mobile robot worldwide, however, the most commonly used techniques are presented here for further study.","date":"2018-01-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Methodology for Path Planning and Optimization of Mobile Robots","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918309621","accessDate":"2022-08-09T14:49:02Z","volume":"133","pages":"141-152","publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","series":"International Conference on Robotics and Smart Manufacturing (RoSMa2018)","DOI":"10.1016/j.procs.2018.07.018","journalAbbreviation":"Procedia Computer Science","ISSN":"1877-0509","creators":[{"firstName":"Mohd.

In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate ‚Äúnarrow passages‚Äù can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.","date":"2009-05","shortTitle":"CHOMP","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"489-494","proceedingsTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","conferenceName":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152817","creators":[{"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Ratliff","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Zucker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

We pursue a graph search method that, despite the high dimensionality of the problem, the complex dynamics of the system and the continuously changing environment model is capable of generating dynamically feasible motions in real-time. This is enabled by leveraging the differential flatness property of the system and by developing a structured search space based on state lattice motion primitives. We suggest a greedy algorithm to generate these primitives off-line automatically, given the robot's motion model. The process samples the reachability of the system and reduces it to a set of representative, canonical motions that are compatible with the state lattice structure, which guarantees that any incremental replanning algorithm is able to produce smooth dynamically feasible motion plans while reusing previous computation between replans. Simulated and physical experimental results demonstrate real-time replanning due to the inevitable and frequent world model updates during micro-UAV motion in partially known environments.","date":"2013-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"2452-2458","proceedingsTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","conferenceName":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2013.6630910","creators":[{"firstName":"Mihail","lastName":"Pivtoraiko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Mellinger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Aerospace electronics","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Robot sensing systems","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T17:01:07Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T17:01:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MQCQ756P","itemID":188,"attachments":[{"key":"2X8QHY44","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6630910?arnumber=6630910","accessDate":"2022-04-20T17:01:24Z","parentItem":"MQCQ756P","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"6630910.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T17:01:24Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T17:01:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2X8QHY44","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2X8QHY44/6630910.html","defaultPath":"files/190/6630910.html"},{"key":"9E4H2YXU","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6630910&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NjYzMDkxMA==","accessDate":"2022-04-20T17:01:10Z","parentItem":"MQCQ756P","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pivtoraiko et al. - 2013 - Incremental micro-UAV motion replanning for explor.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T17:01:10Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T17:01:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9E4H2YXU","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/9E4H2YXU/Pivtoraiko et al. - 2013 - Incremental micro-UAV motion replanning for explor.pdf","defaultPath":"files/189/Pivtoraiko et al. - 2013 - Incremental micro-UAV motion replanning for explor.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762435,"version":0},"$loki":1137},{"itemID":508,"item":{"key":"MTHPTT8E","version":0,"itemType":"thesis","title":"On-line trajectory generation in robotics basic concepts for instantaneous reactions to unforeseen (sensor) events","date":"2010","language":"English","libraryCatalog":"Open WorldCat","extra":"ISBN: 9783642051746 9783642262296\nOCLC: 560411391","creators":[{"firstName":"Torsten","lastName":"Kr√∂ger","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T08:37:38Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T08:37:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MTHPTT8E","itemID":508,"attachments":[{"key":"94DTQNVM","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kr√∂ger - 2010 - On-line trajectory generation in robotics basic co.pdf","parentItem":"MTHPTT8E","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kr√∂ger - 2010 - On-line trajectory generation in robotics basic co.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T08:40:25Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T08:40:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/94DTQNVM","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/94DTQNVM/Kr√∂ger - 2010 - On-line trajectory generation in robotics basic co.pdf","defaultPath":"files/509/Kr√∂ger - 2010 - On-line trajectory generation in robotics basic co.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762435,"version":0},"$loki":1138},{"itemID":889,"item":{"key":"MZ7542MW","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Policy-Guided Heuristic Search with Guarantees","abstractNote":"The use of a policy and a heuristic function for guiding search can be quite effective in adversarial problems, as demonstrated by AlphaGo and its successors, which are based on the PUCT search algorithm. While PUCT can also be used to solve singleagent deterministic problems, it lacks guarantees on its search effort and it can be computationally inefÔ¨Åcient in practice. Combining the A* algorithm with a learned heuristic function tends to work better in these domains, but A* and its variants do not use a policy. Moreover, the purpose of using A* is to Ô¨Ånd solutions of minimum cost, while we seek instead to minimize the search loss (e.g., the number of search steps). LevinTS is guided by a policy and provides guarantees on the number of search steps that relate to the quality of the policy, but it does not make use of a heuristic function. In this work we introduce Policy-guided Heuristic Search (PHS), a novel search algorithm that uses both a heuristic function and a policy and has theoretical guarantees on the search loss that relates to both the quality of the heuristic and of the policy. We show empirically on the sliding-tile puzzle, Sokoban, and a puzzle from the commercial game ‚ÄòThe Witness‚Äô that PHS enables the rapid learning of both a policy and a heuristic function and compares favorably with A*, Weighted A*, Greedy Best-First Search, LevinTS, and PUCT in terms of number of problems solved and search time in all three domains tested.","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"9","creators":[{"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Orseau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Levi H S","lastName":"Lelis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-27T12:38:44Z","dateModified":"2022-06-27T12:38:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MZ7542MW","itemID":889,"attachments":[{"key":"5WUXRGBD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Orseau and Lelis - Policy-Guided Heuristic Search with Guarantees.pdf","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/17469/17276","accessDate":"2022-06-27T12:38:43Z","parentItem":"MZ7542MW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Orseau and Lelis - Policy-Guided Heuristic Search with Guarantees.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-27T12:38:43Z","dateModified":"2022-06-27T12:38:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5WUXRGBD","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/5WUXRGBD/Orseau and Lelis - Policy-Guided Heuristic Search with Guarantees.pdf","defaultPath":"files/888/Orseau and Lelis - Policy-Guided Heuristic Search with Guarantees.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762436,"version":0},"$loki":1139},{"itemID":864,"item":{"key":"N26QTSDS","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Sparse Graphical Memory for Robust Planning","abstractNote":"To operate effectively in the real world, agents should be able to act from high-dimensional raw sensory input such as images and achieve diverse goals across long time-horizons.  Current deep reinforcement and imitation learning methods can learn directly from high-dimensional inputs but do not scale well to long-horizon tasks. In contrast, classical graphical methods like A* search are able to solve long-horizon tasks, but assume that the state space is abstracted away from raw sensory input. Recent works have attempted to combine the strengths of deep learning and classical planning; however, dominant methods in this domain are still quite brittle and scale poorly with the size of the environment. We introduce Sparse Graphical Memory (SGM), a new data structure that stores states and feasible transitions in a sparse memory. SGM aggregates states according to a novel two-way consistency objective, adapting classic state aggregation criteria to goal-conditioned RL: two states are redundant when they are interchangeable both as goals and as starting states. Theoretically, we prove that merging nodes according to two-way consistency leads to an increase in shortest path lengths that scales only linearly with the merging threshold. Experimentally, we show that SGM significantly outperforms current state of the art methods on long horizon, sparse-reward visual navigation tasks.

In this paper, we consider the problem of obstacle avoidance in simple 3D environments where the robot has to solely rely on a single monocular camera. In particular, we are interested in solving this problem without relying on localization, mapping, or planning techniques. Most of the existing work consider obstacle avoidance as two separate problems, namely obstacle detection, and control. Inspired by the recent advantages of deep reinforcement learning in Atari games and understanding highly complex situations in Go, we tackle the obstacle avoidance problem as a data-driven end-to-end deep learning approach. Our approach takes raw images as input and generates control commands as output. We show that discrete action spaces are outperforming continuous control commands in terms of expected average reward in maze-like environments. Furthermore, we show how to accelerate the learning and increase the robustness of the policy by incorporating predicted depth maps by a generative adversarial network.","date":"2021-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2577-087X","pages":"14360-14366","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560787","creators":[{"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Wenzel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Torsten","lastName":"Sch√∂n","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Leal-Taix√©","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Cremers","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Aerospace electronics","type":1},{"tag":"Navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Cameras","type":1},{"tag":"Gray-scale","type":1},{"tag":"Reinforcement learning","type":1},{"tag":"Robot vision systems","type":1},{"tag":"Training","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:50:31Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:50:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/N2L2JBHB","itemID":146,"attachments":[{"key":"YWH2LTSH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560787/?arnumber=9560787","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:50:53Z","parentItem":"N2L2JBHB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9560787.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:50:53Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:50:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YWH2LTSH","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/YWH2LTSH/9560787.html","defaultPath":"files/148/9560787.html"},{"key":"6GW6D2DF","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560787&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTU2MDc4Nw==","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:50:46Z","parentItem":"N2L2JBHB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wenzel et al. - 2021 - Vision-Based Mobile Robotics Obstacle Avoidance Wi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:50:46Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:50:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6GW6D2DF","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/6GW6D2DF/Wenzel et al. - 2021 - Vision-Based Mobile Robotics Obstacle Avoidance Wi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/147/Wenzel et al. - 2021 - Vision-Based Mobile Robotics Obstacle Avoidance Wi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762437,"version":0},"$loki":1141},{"itemID":1177,"item":{"key":"N4KLL3EW","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Efficient Search of the k Shortest Non-Homotopic Paths by Eliminating Non-k-Optimal Topologies","abstractNote":"An efficient algorithm to solve the $k$ shortest non-homotopic path planning ($k$-SNPP) problem in a 2D environment is proposed in this paper. Motivated by accelerating the inefficient exploration of the homotopy-augmented space of the 2D environment, our fundamental idea is to identify the non-$k$-optimal path topologies as early as possible and terminate the pathfinding along them. This is a non-trivial practice because it has to be done at an intermediate state of the path planning process when locally shortest paths have not been fully constructed. In other words, the paths to be compared have not rendezvoused at the goal location, which makes the homotopy theory, modelling the spatial relationship among the paths having the same endpoint, not applicable. This paper is the first work that develops a systematic distance-based topology simplification mechanism to solve the $k$-SNPP task, whose core contribution is to assert the distance-based order of non-homotopic locally shortest paths before constructing them. If the order can be predicted, then those path topologies having more than $k$ better topologies are proven free of the desired $k$ paths and thus can be safely discarded during the path planning process. To this end, a hierarchical topological tree is proposed as an implementation of the mechanism, whose nodes are proven to expand in non-homotopic directions and edges (collision-free path segments) are proven locally shortest. With efficient criteria that observe the order relations between partly constructed locally shortest paths being imparted into the tree, the tree nodes that expand in non-$k$-optimal topologies will not be expanded. As a result, the computational time for solving the $k$-SNPP problem is reduced by near two orders of magnitude.","date":"2022-07-27","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13604","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:45:54Z","extra":"arXiv:2207.13604 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2207.13604","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:2207.13604","creators":[{"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Xiong","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:45:55Z","dateModified":"2022-10-04T11:00:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/N4KLL3EW","itemID":1177,"attachments":[{"key":"HTCLP5QM","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13604.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:52:32Z","parentItem":"N4KLL3EW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yang et al. - 2022 - Efficient Search of the k Shortest Non-Homotopic P.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:52:32Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:52:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/HTCLP5QM","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HTCLP5QM/Yang et al. - 2022 - Efficient Search of the k Shortest Non-Homotopic P.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1194/Yang et al. - 2022 - Efficient Search of the k Shortest Non-Homotopic P.pdf"},{"key":"2XRGL2NM","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13604","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:52:37Z","parentItem":"N4KLL3EW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2207.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:52:37Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:52:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2XRGL2NM","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2XRGL2NM/2207.html","defaultPath":"files/1195/2207.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"IL7Q9ZBS","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"N4KLL3EW","note":"Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:45:55Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:45:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IL7Q9ZBS"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762438,"version":0},"$loki":1142},{"itemID":1081,"item":{"key":"N8D6ULEX","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heuristic approaches in robot path planning: A survey","abstractNote":"Autonomous navigation of a robot is a promising research domain due to its extensive applications. The navigation consists of four essential requirements known as perception, localization, cognition and path planning, and motion control in which path planning is the most important and interesting part. The proposed path planning techniques are classified into two main categories: classical methods and heuristic methods. The classical methods consist of cell decomposition, potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty. This survey concentrates on heuristic-based algorithms in robot path planning which are comprised of neural network, fuzzy logic, nature-inspired algorithms and hybrid algorithms. In addition, potential field method is also considered due to the good results. The strengths and drawbacks of each algorithm are discussed and future outline is provided.","date":"2016-12-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Heuristic approaches in robot path planning","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889015300671","accessDate":"2022-08-09T14:54:28Z","volume":"86","pages":"13-28","publicationTitle":"Robotics and Autonomous Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.robot.2016.08.001","journalAbbreviation":"Robotics and Autonomous Systems","ISSN":"0921-8890","creators":[{"firstName":"Thi Thoa","lastName":"Mac","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cosmin","lastName":"Copot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Duc Trung","lastName":"Tran","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"De Keyser","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Autonomous navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Fuzzy logic","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic methods","type":1},{"tag":"Nature inspired algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Neural network","type":1},{"tag":"Potential field method","type":1},{"tag":"Robot path planning","type":1}],"collections":["XEGDLIT3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T14:54:28Z","dateModified":"2022-08-10T09:46:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/N8D6ULEX","itemID":1081,"attachments":[{"key":"VAK4574D","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Full Text PDF","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889015300671/pdfft?md5=e784a3bb421ba477c2de8ed433265663&pid=1-s2.0-S0921889015300671-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y","accessDate":"2022-08-09T14:54:30Z","parentItem":"N8D6ULEX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mac et al. - 2016 - Heuristic approaches in robot path planning A sur.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T14:54:30Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T14:54:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VAK4574D","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/VAK4574D/Mac et al. - 2016 - Heuristic approaches in robot path planning A sur.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1082/Mac et al. - 2016 - Heuristic approaches in robot path planning A sur.pdf"},{"key":"XMCFC98N","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889015300671","accessDate":"2022-08-09T14:54:50Z","parentItem":"N8D6ULEX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0921889015300671.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T14:54:50Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T14:54:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XMCFC98N","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XMCFC98N/S0921889015300671.html","defaultPath":"files/1083/S0921889015300671.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762439,"version":0},"$loki":1143},{"itemID":113,"item":{"key":"NA9LPLT7","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Multi-sensor fusion for robust autonomous flight in indoor and outdoor environments with a rotorcraft MAV","abstractNote":"We present a modular and extensible approach to integrate noisy measurements from multiple heterogeneous sensors that yield either absolute or relative observations at different and varying time intervals, and to provide smooth and globally consistent estimates of position in real time for autonomous flight.

Therefore, we integrate different waypoint generators into existing navigation systems and compare the joint system against traditional ones. We found an increased performance in terms of safety, efficiency and path smoothness, especially in highly dynamic environments.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"1213-1220","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636039","creators":[{"firstName":"Linh","lastName":"K√§stner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinlin","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Teham","lastName":"Buiyan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Junhui","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhengcheng","lastName":"Shen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Lambrecht","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cornelius","lastName":"Marx","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Safety","type":1},{"tag":"Buildings","type":1},{"tag":"Navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Robot sensing systems","type":1},{"tag":"Reinforcement learning","type":1},{"tag":"Generators","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:30:19Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:30:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NF8T7SDD","itemID":498,"attachments":[{"key":"MQFM4R56","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636039?arnumber=9636039","accessDate":"2022-05-18T14:30:34Z","parentItem":"NF8T7SDD","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9636039.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:30:34Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:30:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MQFM4R56","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/MQFM4R56/9636039.html","defaultPath":"files/500/9636039.html"},{"key":"6Q5RARQA","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9636039&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTYzNjAzOQ==","accessDate":"2022-05-18T14:30:25Z","parentItem":"NF8T7SDD","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"K√§stner et al. - 2021 - Connecting Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based Obsta.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T14:30:25Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T14:30:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6Q5RARQA","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/6Q5RARQA/K√§stner et al. - 2021 - Connecting Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based Obsta.pdf","defaultPath":"files/499/K√§stner et al. - 2021 - Connecting Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based Obsta.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762444,"version":0},"$loki":1147},{"itemID":586,"item":{"key":"NKRQIUYH","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Improved Bat Algorithm for UAV Path Planning in Three-Dimensional Space","abstractNote":"This paper describes the flight path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the advanced swarm optimization algorithm of the bat algorithm (BA) in a static environment. The main purpose of this work is that the UAVs can obtain an accident-free, shorter, and safer flight path between the starting point and the endpoint in the complex three-dimensional battlefield environment. Based on the characteristics of the standard BA and the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), a new modification of the BA algorithm is proposed in this work, namely, the improved bat algorithm integrated into the ABC algorithm (IBA). The IBA mainly uses ABC to modify the BA and solves the problem of poor local search ability of the BA. This article demonstrates the convergence of the IBA and performs simulations in MATLAB environment to verify its effectiveness. The simulations showed that the time required for the IBA to obtain the optimum solution is approximately 50% lower than the BA, and that the quality of the optimum solution is about 14% higher than the ABC. Furthermore, by comparing with other traditional and improved swarm intelligent path planning algorithms, the IBA can plan a faster, shorter, safer, accident-free flight path for UAVs. Finally, this article proves that IBA also has good performance in optimizing functions and has broad application potential.","date":"2021","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Access","volume":"9","pages":"20100-20116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3054179","ISSN":"2169-3536","creators":[{"firstName":"Xianjin","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Fang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zehong","lastName":"Lan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Optimization","type":1},{"tag":"path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"üî•"},{"tag":"Convergence","type":1},{"tag":"Battlefield environment","type":1},{"tag":"convergence","type":1},{"tag":"improved bat algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"local search","type":1},{"tag":"Particle swarm optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Radar","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T12:54:16Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T12:55:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NKRQIUYH","itemID":586,"attachments":[{"key":"B4I2K36P","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9334996?arnumber=9334996","accessDate":"2022-05-24T12:54:39Z","parentItem":"NKRQIUYH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9334996.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T12:54:39Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T12:54:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/B4I2K36P","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/B4I2K36P/9334996.html","defaultPath":"files/588/9334996.html"},{"key":"PU3NW5VE","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9312710/09334996.pdf?tp=&arnumber=9334996&isnumber=9312710&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTMzNDk5Ng==","accessDate":"2022-05-24T12:54:22Z","parentItem":"NKRQIUYH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou et al. - 2021 - Improved Bat Algorithm for UAV Path Planning in Th.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T12:54:22Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T12:54:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PU3NW5VE","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/PU3NW5VE/Zhou et al. - 2021 - Improved Bat Algorithm for UAV Path Planning in Th.pdf","defaultPath":"files/587/Zhou et al. - 2021 - Improved Bat Algorithm for UAV Path Planning in Th.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762445,"version":0},"$loki":1148},{"itemID":993,"item":{"key":"NPNE38NT","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Optimal and Efficient Path Planning for Unknown and Dynamic Environments","abstractNote":"The task of planning trajectories for a mobile robot hat received considerable attention in the research literature. Algorithms exist for handling a variety of robot shapes, configurations, motion constraints, and environments. Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of unknown or partially-known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan (indoor) or terrain map (outdoor). Existing approaches plan an initial global path or route based on known information and then modify the plan locally as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors.While this strategy works well in environments with small, sparse obstacles, it can lead to grossly suboptimal and incomplete results in cluttered spaces. An alternative approach is to replan the global path from scratch each time a new obstacle is discovered. While this approach is optimal, it is grossly inefficient and can require a high-performance computer for real-time operation. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner. D* models the environment as a graph, where each node represents a robot state (e.g., a location in a room), and each arc represents the cost (e.g., distance to travel) of moving between two states. Initially, a path is planned from the goal to the robot's location using known information. As the robot moves, its sensors discover obstacles in its path. These discoveries are handled by modifying the arc costs. D* propagates information minimally about these arc changes in the graph ...","date":"1993","libraryCatalog":"CiteSeer","callNumber":"D*","volume":"10","pages":"89‚Äì100","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Robotics and Automation","creators":[{"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Stentz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"}],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T09:48:08Z","dateModified":"2022-08-10T13:11:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NPNE38NT","itemID":993,"attachments":[{"key":"JIJ3DCAQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Citeseer - Full Text PDF","url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=6D5C31A0E6214906EB5B8129FE559590?doi=10.1.1.15.3683&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2022-07-18T09:48:10Z","parentItem":"NPNE38NT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stentz - 1993 - Optimal and Efficient Path Planning for Unknown an.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T09:48:10Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T09:48:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JIJ3DCAQ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JIJ3DCAQ/Stentz - 1993 - Optimal and Efficient Path Planning for Unknown an.pdf","defaultPath":"files/994/Stentz - 1993 - Optimal and Efficient Path Planning for Unknown an.pdf"},{"key":"XH8KPQCX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Citeseer - Snapshot","url":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.15.3683","accessDate":"2022-07-18T09:48:13Z","parentItem":"NPNE38NT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"summary.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T09:48:13Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T09:48:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XH8KPQCX","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XH8KPQCX/summary.html","defaultPath":"files/995/summary.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762446,"version":0},"$loki":1149},{"itemID":1223,"item":{"key":"NRBBMY87","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Path Planning with Homotopic Constraints for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"182","creators":[{"firstName":"Emili Hern√†ndez","lastName":"Bes","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üìö"}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T09:43:27Z","dateModified":"2022-09-21T13:32:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NRBBMY87","itemID":1223,"attachments":[{"key":"44JJFRP9","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bes - Path Planning with Homotopic Constraints for Auton.pdf","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132553938.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-11T09:43:26Z","parentItem":"NRBBMY87","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bes - Path Planning with Homotopic Constraints for Auton.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T09:43:26Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T09:43:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/44JJFRP9","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/44JJFRP9/Bes - Path Planning with Homotopic Constraints for Auton.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1222/Bes - Path Planning with Homotopic Constraints for Auton.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762447,"version":0},"$loki":1150},{"itemID":1362,"item":{"key":"NRFHWQFV","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Multiscale Topological Trajectory Classification with Persistent Homology","abstractNote":"Topological approaches to studying equivalence classes of trajectories in a conÔ¨Åguration space have recently received attention in robotics since they allow a robot to reason about trajectories at a high level of abstraction. While recent work has approached the problem of topological motion planning under the assumption that the conÔ¨Åguration space and obstacles within it are explicitly described in a noise-free manner, we focus on trajectory classiÔ¨Åcation and present a samplingbased approach which can handle noise, which is applicable to general conÔ¨Åguration spaces and which relies only on the availability of collision free samples. Unlike previous samplingbased approaches in robotics which use graphs to capture information about the path-connectedness of a conÔ¨Åguration space, we construct a multiscale approximation of neighborhoods of the collision free conÔ¨Ågurations based on Ô¨Åltrations of simplicial complexes. Our approach thereby extracts additional homological information which is essential for a topological trajectory classiÔ¨Åcation. By computing a basis for the Ô¨Årst persistent homology groups, we obtain a multiscale classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm for trajectories in conÔ¨Åguration spaces of arbitrary dimension. We furthermore show how an augmented Ô¨Åltration of simplicial complexes based on a cost function can be deÔ¨Åned to incorporate additional constraints. We present an evaluation of our approach in 2, 3, 4 and 6 dimensional conÔ¨Åguration spaces in simulation and using a Baxter robot.","date":"2014-07-12","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss10/p54.pdf","accessDate":"2022-09-09T05:17:05Z","publisher":"Robotics: Science and Systems Foundation","ISBN":"978-0-9923747-0-9","proceedingsTitle":"Robotics: Science and Systems X","conferenceName":"Robotics: Science and Systems 2014","DOI":"10.15607/RSS.2014.X.054","creators":[{"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"T.

The proposed framework exploits the Voronoi bias property of Rapidly exploring Random Tree* (RRT*), which balances the exploration-exploitation in Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is employed to learn policy (sequence of actions), while RRT* is planning simultaneously. Once policy is learned for a fixed start and goal, repeated planing for identical start and goal can be avoided. In case of any environmental uncertainties, RL dynamically adapts the learned policy with the help of RRT*. Apparently, both learning and planning complement each other to handle environmental uncertainties dynamically in real-time and online. Interestingly, more the proposed algorithm runs, its efficiency increases in terms of planning time and uncertainty handling capability over the contender algorithm (i.e., RRT*).

Adaptive A * is a recent incremental heuristic search algorithm that solves series of similar search problems faster than A * because it updates the h-values using information from previous searches. It basically transforms consistent h-values into more informed consistent h-values. This allows it to find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase over time since consistent h-values remain consistent after action cost increases. However, it is not guaranteed to find shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can decrease over time because consistent h-values do not necessarily remain consistent after action cost decreases. Thus, the h-values need to get corrected after action cost decreases. In this paper, we show how to do that, resulting in Generalized Adaptive A* (GAA*) that finds shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase or decrease over time. Our experiments demonstrate that Generalized Adaptive A* outperforms breadth-first search, A* and D* Lite for moving-target search, where D * Lite is an alternative state-of-the-art incremental heuristic search algorithm that finds shortest paths in state spaces where the action costs can increase or decrease over time.","date":"2008","libraryCatalog":"CiteSeer","pages":"281‚Äì288","proceedingsTitle":"In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Xiaoxun","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Koenig","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"William","lastName":"Yeoh","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T10:11:41Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T10:11:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NVQFASAI","itemID":1002,"attachments":[{"key":"9S2USVYZ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Citeseer - Full Text PDF","url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.149.7385&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2022-07-18T10:11:43Z","parentItem":"NVQFASAI","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sun et al. - 2008 - Generalized Adaptive A.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T10:11:43Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T10:11:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9S2USVYZ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/9S2USVYZ/Sun et al. - 2008 - Generalized Adaptive A.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1003/Sun et al. - 2008 - Generalized Adaptive A.pdf"},{"key":"E4RTTHLC","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Citeseer - Snapshot","url":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.149.7385","accessDate":"2022-07-18T10:11:45Z","parentItem":"NVQFASAI","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"summary.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-18T10:11:45Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T10:11:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/E4RTTHLC","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/E4RTTHLC/summary.html","defaultPath":"files/1004/summary.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762451,"version":0},"$loki":1153},{"itemID":532,"item":{"key":"NVQV6CNI","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Three-dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path planning using modified wolf pack search algorithm","abstractNote":"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been a research focus in recent years. The path planner is a key element of the unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous control module. In this paper, the modified wolf pack search (WPS) algorithm is applied to compute the quasi-optimal trajectories for the rotor wing UAVs in the complex three-dimensional (3D) spaces including the real and fake 3D spaces. Moreover, it adopts the multi-objective cost function. In the path planning process, some concepts in the genetic algorithm (GA) are applied to realize the WPS algorithm. Then, the crossover and mutation operators in the GA method are introduced to improve the original WPS algorithm. Considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle, the path smoothing process based on the cubic B-spline curve is used to make the planning path suitable for the fixed wing UAVs. Simulation results show that this approach is efficient for the rotor wing UAVs and the fixed wing UAVs when taking into account of all kinds of constraints and the path generated is flyable. Moreover, the comparisons of the four algorithms show that the trajectories produced by the modified WPS algorithm are far superior to the original WPS algorithm, the GA and the random search way under the same conditions.","date":"2017-11-29","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231217309220","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:42:16Z","volume":"266","pages":"445-457","publicationTitle":"Neurocomputing","DOI":"10.1016/j.neucom.2017.05.059","journalAbbreviation":"Neurocomputing","ISSN":"0925-2312","creators":[{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"YongBo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"YueSong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"JianQiao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Su","lastName":"XiaoLong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Nuo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Genetic algorithm (GA)","type":1},{"tag":"Cubic B-spline curve","type":1},{"tag":"Modified wolf pack search (WPS) algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"Three dimensional (3D) space","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:42:16Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:42:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NVQV6CNI","itemID":532,"attachments":[{"key":"V2TX4VE9","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231217309220?via%3Dihub","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:42:30Z","parentItem":"NVQV6CNI","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0925231217309220.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:42:30Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:42:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/V2TX4VE9","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/V2TX4VE9/S0925231217309220.html","defaultPath":"files/533/S0925231217309220.html"},{"key":"U3Z8QIUG","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"YongBo et al. - 2017 - Three-dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path pla.pdf","parentItem":"NVQV6CNI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"YongBo et al. - 2017 - Three-dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path pla.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:43:04Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:43:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/U3Z8QIUG","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/U3Z8QIUG/YongBo et al. - 2017 - Three-dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path pla.pdf","defaultPath":"files/534/YongBo et al. - 2017 - Three-dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path pla.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762452,"version":0},"$loki":1154},{"itemID":903,"item":{"key":"NZVDWF7P","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Operator Counting Heuristics for Probabilistic Planning","abstractNote":"For the past 25 years, heuristic search has been used to solve domain-independent probabilistic planning problems, but with heuristics that determinise the problem and ignore precious probabilistic information.

Currently, these inspections are primarily conducted by maintenance personnel. Inspectors must scrutinize the aircraft's surface to find and document defects such as dents, hail damage, broken fasteners, etc.; this is a time consuming, tedious, and hazardous process. The goal of this work is to develop a visual inspection system which can be used by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and to test the feasibility of this system on military aircraft. Using an autonomous system in place of trained personnel will improve the safety and efficiency of the inspection process. Open-source software for coverage path planning (CPP) is modified and used to create a path from which the UAV can view the entire top surface of the aircraft. Simulated and experimental flight testing is conducted to validate the generated paths by collecting imagery, flight data, and coverage estimates. Simulation is also used to predict UAV performance for an inspection of a full-size aircraft. Analysis shows that multirotor UAVs are a viable inspection platform for military aircraft.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"575-581","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476718","creators":[{"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Silberberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert C.","lastName":"Leishman","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Safety","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Atmospheric modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Inspection","type":1},{"tag":"Aircraft","type":1},{"tag":"Location awareness","type":1},{"tag":"aircraft inspection","type":1},{"tag":"coverage path planning (CPP)","type":1},{"tag":"Military aircraft","type":1},{"tag":"multirotor UAV","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:23:48Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:23:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PBRHL43W","itemID":263,"attachments":[{"key":"PLPG9T64","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476718/?arnumber=9476718","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:23:56Z","parentItem":"PBRHL43W","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476718.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:23:56Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:23:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PLPG9T64","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/PLPG9T64/9476718.html","defaultPath":"files/265/9476718.html"},{"key":"MRF676UM","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476718&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3NjcxOA==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T10:23:50Z","parentItem":"PBRHL43W","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Silberberg and Leishman - 2021 - Aircraft Inspection by Multirotor UAV Using Covera.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T10:23:50Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T10:23:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MRF676UM","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/MRF676UM/Silberberg and Leishman - 2021 - Aircraft Inspection by Multirotor UAV Using Covera.pdf","defaultPath":"files/264/Silberberg and Leishman - 2021 - Aircraft Inspection by Multirotor UAV Using Covera.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762453,"version":0},"$loki":1156},{"itemID":874,"item":{"key":"PDSPQC3Z","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Efficient state-space modularization for planning: theory, behavioral and neural signatures","abstractNote":"Even in state-spaces of modest size, planning is plagued by the ‚Äúcurse of dimensionality‚Äù. This problem is particularly acute in human and animal cognition given the limited capacity of working memory, and the time pressures under which planning often occurs in the natural environment. Hierarchically organized modular representations have long been suggested to underlie the capacity of biological systems to efficiently and flexibly plan in complex environments. However, the principles underlying efficient modularization remain obscure, making it difficult to identify its behavioral and neural signatures. Here, we develop a normative theory of efficient state-space representations which partitions an environment into distinct modules by minimizing the average (information theoretic) description length of planning within the environment, thereby optimally trading off the complexity of planning across and within modules. We show that such optimal representations provide a unifying account for a diverse range of hitherto unrelated phenomena at multiple levels of behavior and neural representation.","date":"2016","shortTitle":"Efficient state-space modularization for planning","libraryCatalog":"Neural Information Processing Systems","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/hash/10907813b97e249163587e6246612e21-Abstract.html","accessDate":"2022-06-24T15:02:26Z","volume":"29","publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","proceedingsTitle":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"McNamee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel M","lastName":"Wolpert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mate","lastName":"Lengyel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T15:02:26Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T15:02:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PDSPQC3Z","itemID":874,"attachments":[{"key":"NSIN6ZKD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/file/10907813b97e249163587e6246612e21-Paper.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-24T15:02:28Z","parentItem":"PDSPQC3Z","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"McNamee et al. - 2016 - Efficient state-space modularization for planning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T15:02:28Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T15:02:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NSIN6ZKD","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/NSIN6ZKD/McNamee et al. - 2016 - Efficient state-space modularization for planning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/875/McNamee et al. - 2016 - Efficient state-space modularization for planning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762454,"version":0},"$loki":1157},{"itemID":1366,"item":{"key":"PGVLI73X","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A roadmap for the computation of persistent homology","abstractNote":"Persistent homology (PH) is a method used in topological data analysis (TDA) to study qualitative features of data that persist across multiple scales.

The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and new algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a rapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and computational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and (2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation of PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the computation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source implementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we indicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different types of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the computation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the tutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in the benchmarking.","date":"12/2017","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08903","accessDate":"2022-09-09T13:16:32Z","extra":"arXiv:1506.08903 [physics, q-bio]","volume":"6","pages":"17","publicationTitle":"EPJ Data Science","DOI":"10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0109-5","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"EPJ Data Sci.","ISSN":"2193-1127","creators":[{"firstName":"Nina","lastName":"Otter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mason A.","lastName":"Porter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ulrike","lastName":"Tillmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Grindrod","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Heather A.","lastName":"Harrington","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computational Geometry","type":1},{"tag":"Mathematics - Algebraic Topology","type":1},{"tag":"Physics - Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","type":1},{"tag":"Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-09T13:16:32Z","dateModified":"2022-09-09T13:16:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PGVLI73X","itemID":1366,"attachments":[{"key":"SQTKH9CE","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08903.pdf","accessDate":"2022-09-09T13:16:35Z","parentItem":"PGVLI73X","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Otter et al. - 2017 - A roadmap for the computation of persistent homolo.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-09T13:16:35Z","dateModified":"2022-09-09T13:16:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SQTKH9CE","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SQTKH9CE/Otter et al. - 2017 - A roadmap for the computation of persistent homolo.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1368/Otter et al. - 2017 - A roadmap for the computation of persistent homolo.pdf"},{"key":"JDP8QX8L","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08903","accessDate":"2022-09-09T13:16:40Z","parentItem":"PGVLI73X","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1506.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-09T13:16:40Z","dateModified":"2022-09-09T13:16:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JDP8QX8L","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JDP8QX8L/1506.html","defaultPath":"files/1369/1506.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"59FU6Z5G","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"PGVLI73X","note":"Comment: Final version; minor changes throughout, added a section to the tutorial","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-09T13:16:32Z","dateModified":"2022-09-09T13:16:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/59FU6Z5G"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762455,"version":0},"$loki":1158},{"itemID":833,"item":{"key":"PLJZM6HF","version":0,"itemType":"preprint","title":"A Reinforcement Learning based Path Planning Approach in 3D Environment","abstractNote":"Optimal motion planning involves obstacles avoidance where path planning is the key to success in optimal motion planning. Due to the computational demands, most of the path planning algorithms can not be employed for real-time based applications. Model-based reinforcement learning approaches for path planning have received certain success in the recent past. Yet, most of such approaches do not have deterministic output due to the randomness. We analyzed several types of reinforcement learning-based approaches for path planning. One of them is a deterministic tree-based approach and other two approaches are based on Q-learning and approximate policy gradient, respectively. We tested preceding approaches on two different simulators, each of which consists of a set of random obstacles that can be changed or moved dynamically. After analysing the result and computation time, we concluded that the deterministic tree search approach provides highly stable result. However, the computational time is considerably higher than the other two approaches.

Although recent advances allow robots to evolve in many such environments, one of the most important problems remains the establishment of collision-free trajectories in static or partially (temporal) static environments. This paper presents a different approach to address this problem, proposing a methodology based on homotopy continuation methods (HCM) capable of generating collision-free trajectories in two and three dimensions. The basic idea behind the proposal relies on the construction of a nonlinear equation representing the map of the environment, making it possible to apply HCM methods to obtain collision-free paths.

Most of the existing studies exploring area coverage have considered only a single region, however, few recent studies have considered coverage of multiple distributed regions. One of the limitations which UAV suffers while covering distributed multiple regions is energy constraints where complete area coverage is not possible. From a strategical point of view, we propose a novel algorithm which solves a variant of area coverage problem where the UAV aims to achieve near-optimal area coverage due to path length limitation caused by the energy constraint. In this paper, a preliminary study is conducted by first formulating the problem and later on presenting a solution. The solution has been partitioned into two inter-dependent sub-problems: i) inter-region coverage, ii) intra-region coverage. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated by analysing its properties over an exhaustive set of test case scenarios and comparing it against two state-of-the-art area coverage approaches.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"1659-1664","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476696","creators":[{"firstName":"Zeba","lastName":"Khanam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"McDonald-Maier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shoaib","lastName":"Ehsan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Aircraft","type":1},{"tag":"Coverage Path Planning (CPP)","type":1},{"tag":"Energy Constraints","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental monitoring","type":1},{"tag":"Partial Area Coverage","type":1},{"tag":"Partitioning algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV)","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T09:59:34Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T09:59:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PS937L75","itemID":230,"attachments":[{"key":"5QEUEC8P","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476696/?arnumber=9476696","accessDate":"2022-04-21T09:59:46Z","parentItem":"PS937L75","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476696.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T09:59:46Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T09:59:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5QEUEC8P","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/5QEUEC8P/9476696.html","defaultPath":"files/232/9476696.html"},{"key":"F5VAB9U2","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476696&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3NjY5Ng==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T09:59:36Z","parentItem":"PS937L75","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Khanam et al. - 2021 - Near-Optimal Coverage Path Planning of Distributed.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T09:59:36Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T09:59:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/F5VAB9U2","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/F5VAB9U2/Khanam et al. - 2021 - Near-Optimal Coverage Path Planning of Distributed.pdf","defaultPath":"files/231/Khanam et al. - 2021 - Near-Optimal Coverage Path Planning of Distributed.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762457,"version":0},"$loki":1161},{"itemID":1148,"item":{"key":"PU9RBGHM","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"TOPOLOGICAL AND GEOMETRIC TECHNIQUES IN GRAPH SEARCH-BASED ROBOT PLANNING","date":"2012","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"191","creators":[{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üìö"}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T07:47:28Z","dateModified":"2022-09-21T13:32:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PU9RBGHM","itemID":1148,"attachments":[{"key":"45LQ6955","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bhattacharya - TOPOLOGICAL AND GEOMETRIC TECHNIQUES IN GRAPH SEAR.pdf","url":"https://www.lehigh.edu/~sub216/local-files/dissertation_subhrajit_0b9a1.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-11T07:47:27Z","parentItem":"PU9RBGHM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bhattacharya - TOPOLOGICAL AND GEOMETRIC TECHNIQUES IN GRAPH SEAR.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T07:47:27Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T07:47:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/45LQ6955","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/45LQ6955/Bhattacharya - TOPOLOGICAL AND GEOMETRIC TECHNIQUES IN GRAPH SEAR.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1147/Bhattacharya - TOPOLOGICAL AND GEOMETRIC TECHNIQUES IN GRAPH SEAR.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762458,"version":0},"$loki":1162},{"itemID":832,"item":{"key":"PUYASQ78","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Learning Graph Search Heuristics","abstractNote":"Searching for a path between two nodes in a graph is one of the most well-studied and fundamental problems in computer science. In numerous domains such as robotics, AI, or biology, practitioners develop search heuristics to accelerate their pathÔ¨Ånding algorithms. However, it is a laborious and complex process to handdesign heuristics based on the problem and the structure of a given use case. Here we present PHIL (Path Heuristic with Imitation Learning), a novel neural architecture and a training algorithm for discovering graph search and navigation heuristics from data by leveraging recent advances in imitation learning and graph representation learning. At training time, we aggregate datasets of search trajectories and ground-truth shortest path distances, which we use to train a specialized graph neural network-based heuristic function using backpropagation through steps of the pathÔ¨Ånding process. Our heuristic function learns graph embeddings useful for inferring node distances, runs in constant time independent of graph sizes, and can be easily incorporated in an algorithm such as A* at test time. Experiments show that PHIL reduces the number of explored nodes compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by 40.8% on average and allows for fast planning in time-critical robotics domains.","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"6","creators":[{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"P√°ndy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rex","lastName":"Ying","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Corso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"VelicÀákovic","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jure","lastName":"Leskovec","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Li√≤","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-23T12:56:17Z","dateModified":"2022-06-23T12:56:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PUYASQ78","itemID":832,"attachments":[{"key":"FLDTS6PU","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"P√°ndy et al. - Learning Graph Search Heuristics.pdf","url":"https://physical-reasoning.github.io/assets/pdf/papers/06.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-23T12:56:15Z","parentItem":"PUYASQ78","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"P√°ndy et al. - Learning Graph Search Heuristics.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-23T12:56:15Z","dateModified":"2022-06-23T12:56:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FLDTS6PU","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/FLDTS6PU/P√°ndy et al. - Learning Graph Search Heuristics.pdf","defaultPath":"files/831/P√°ndy et al. - Learning Graph Search Heuristics.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762458,"version":0},"$loki":1163},{"itemID":1035,"item":{"key":"PZA2IWW9","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A Survey on Robot Path Planning using Bio-inspired Algorithms","abstractNote":"The path planning problem has been an essential topic in autonomous robotics.

They produce an optimal or near optimal solution with reduced computational complexity and are thus are considered where deterministic algorithms produce inefficient solutions. Robotics has been a disciplinary field where artificial intelligence is bestowed to robots for them to perform complex tasks similar to human beings. Many of tasks involve decision making removing the need for a human intervener. Robots can efficiently perform their tasks on the ground, air as well as underwater missions. To do so, a very important property required by the robot is to efficiently calculate its path in its surroundings. The path planning problem is a hard problem to solve using deterministic techniques and thus many heuristics based techniques are employed to solve this novel problem. This paper will review some the recent advancements in the path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles using meta-heuristic techniques.

Effective understanding of the surrounding environment and efficient generation of an optimal collision-free path are both critical parts for solving path-planning problems. Although conventional sampling-based algorithms, such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) and its improved optimal version (RRT*), have been widely used in path-planning problems because of their ability to find a feasible path in even complex environments, they fail to find an optimal path efficiently. To solve this problem and satisfy the two aforementioned requirements, we propose a novel learning-based path-planning algorithm which consists of a novel generative model based on the conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) and a modified RRT* algorithm (denoted by CGAN-RRT*). Given the map information, our CGAN model can generate an efficient probability distribution of feasible paths, which can be utilized by the CGAN-RRT* algorithm to find an optimal path with a nonuniform sampling strategy. The CGAN model is trained by learning from ground-truth maps, each of which is generated by putting all the results of executing the RRT algorithm 50 times on one raw map. We demonstrate the efficient performance of this CGAN model by testing it on two groups of maps and comparing the CGAN-RRT* algorithm with the Informed-RRT* algorithm and conventional RRT* algorithm.","date":"2022-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems","volume":"14","pages":"662-671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TCDS.2021.3063273","issue":"2","ISSN":"2379-8939","creators":[{"firstName":"Nachuan","lastName":"Ma","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jiankun","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jianbang","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Max Q.-H.","lastName":"Meng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Prediction algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Gallium nitride","type":1},{"tag":"optimal path planning","type":1},{"tag":"sampling-based path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Predictive models","type":1},{"tag":"Conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs)","type":1},{"tag":"Probability distribution","type":1}],"collections":["YE9SY9RF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T15:18:04Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T15:18:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QBYSYBQE","itemID":1301,"attachments":[{"key":"P4BJMK7X","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9366777?arnumber=9366777","accessDate":"2022-08-23T15:18:17Z","parentItem":"QBYSYBQE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9366777.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T15:18:17Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T15:18:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/P4BJMK7X","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/P4BJMK7X/9366777.html","defaultPath":"files/1303/9366777.html"},{"key":"WVSSBLVK","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9366777&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD9hcm51bWJlcj05MzY2Nzc3","accessDate":"2022-08-23T15:18:08Z","parentItem":"QBYSYBQE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ma et al. - 2022 - Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Op.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T15:18:08Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T15:18:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WVSSBLVK","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WVSSBLVK/Ma et al. - 2022 - Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Op.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1302/Ma et al. - 2022 - Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Op.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762461,"version":0},"$loki":1166},{"itemID":1277,"item":{"key":"QDHTNQRY","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"An Exact Optimal Kinodynamic Planner Based on Homotopy Class Constraints","abstractNote":"This paper proposes a kinodynamic planning algorithm for vehicles with bounds on actuation.

The algorithm guides the exploration so that it draws more samples from the relevant region as the number of iterations increases. The approach works in two steps: first, it predicts if a given sample is collision-free (classification phase) without calling the collision-checker, and it then estimates if it is a promising sample, i.e., if it has the potential to improve the current best solution (regression phase), without solving the local steering problem. The proposed exploration strategy is integrated to the RRT# algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.","date":"2015-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"2646-2652","proceedingsTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353738","creators":[{"firstName":"Oktay","lastName":"Arslan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Tsiotras","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Training","type":1},{"tag":"Prediction algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Approximation algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Search problems","type":1},{"tag":"Machine learning algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Yttrium","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-29T10:12:58Z","dateModified":"2022-06-29T10:12:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QDSUFTR5","itemID":932,"attachments":[{"key":"QQIHFZPJ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7353738?arnumber=7353738","accessDate":"2022-06-29T10:13:12Z","parentItem":"QDSUFTR5","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7353738.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-29T10:13:12Z","dateModified":"2022-06-29T10:13:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QQIHFZPJ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/QQIHFZPJ/7353738.html","defaultPath":"files/934/7353738.html"},{"key":"2W7K5GC6","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353738&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzM1MzczOA==","accessDate":"2022-06-29T10:13:03Z","parentItem":"QDSUFTR5","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Arslan and Tsiotras - 2015 - Machine learning guided exploration for sampling-b.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-29T10:13:03Z","dateModified":"2022-06-29T10:13:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2W7K5GC6","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2W7K5GC6/Arslan and Tsiotras - 2015 - Machine learning guided exploration for sampling-b.pdf","defaultPath":"files/933/Arslan and Tsiotras - 2015 - Machine learning guided exploration for sampling-b.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762464,"version":0},"$loki":1168},{"itemID":602,"item":{"key":"QF8RDTBD","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"PANTHER: Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner in Dynamic Environments","abstractNote":"This paper presents PANTHER, a real-time perception-aware (PA) trajectory planner for multirotor-UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) in dynamic environments. PANTHER plans trajectories that avoid dynamic obstacles while also keeping them in the sensor field of view (FOV) and minimizing the blur to aid in object tracking. The rotation and translation of the UAV are jointly optimized, which allows PANTHER to fully exploit the differential flatness of multirotors to maximize the PA objective. Real-time performance is achieved by implicitly imposing the underactuated dynamics of the UAV through the Hopf fibration. PANTHER is able to keep the obstacles inside the FOV 7.9 and 1.5 times more than non-PA approaches and PA approaches that decouple translation and yaw, respectively. The projected velocity (and hence the blur) is reduced by 18% and 34%, respectively. This leads to average success rates three times larger than state-of-the-art approaches in multi-obstacle avoidance scenarios. The MINVO basis is used to impose low-conservative collision avoidance constraints in position and velocity space. Finally, extensive hardware experiments in unknown dynamic environments with all the computation running onboard are presented, with velocities of up to 5.8 m/s, and with relative velocities (with respect to the obstacles) of up to 6.3 m/s. The only sensors used are an IMU, a forward-facing depth camera, and a downward-facing monocular camera.","date":"2022","shortTitle":"PANTHER","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Access","volume":"10","pages":"22662-22677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3154037","ISSN":"2169-3536","creators":[{"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"Tordesillas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan P.","lastName":"How","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Optimization","type":1},{"tag":"path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"trajectory optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Real-time systems","type":1},{"tag":"unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Cameras","type":1},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"üî•"},{"tag":"Autonomous aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Dynamic obstacle avoidance","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-25T13:14:58Z","dateModified":"2022-05-25T13:16:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QF8RDTBD","itemID":602,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762465,"version":0},"$loki":1169},{"itemID":548,"item":{"key":"QHPGIEHV","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Neural RRT*: Learning-Based Optimal Path Planning","abstractNote":"Rapidly random-exploring tree (RRT) and its variants are very popular due to their ability to quickly and efficiently explore the state space. However, they suffer sensitivity to the initial solution and slow convergence to the optimal solution, which means that they consume a lot of memory and time to find the optimal path. It is critical to quickly find a short path in many applications such as the autonomous vehicle with limited power/fuel. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel optimal path planning algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), namely the neural RRT* (NRRT*). The NRRT* utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution generated from a CNN model. The model is trained using quantities of successful path planning cases. In this article, we use the A* algorithm to generate the training data set consisting of the map information and the optimal path. For a given task, the proposed CNN model can predict the probability distribution of the optimal path on the map, which is used to guide the sampling process. The time cost and memory usage of the planned path are selected as the metric to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the NRRT*. The simulation results reveal that the NRRT* can achieve convincing performance compared with the state-of-the-art path planning algorithms. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this article stems from the need to develop a fast and efficient path planning algorithm for practical applications such as autonomous driving, warehouse robot, and countless others. Sampling-based algorithms are widely used in these areas due to their good scalability and high efficiency. However, the quality of the initial path is not guaranteed and it takes much time to converge to the optimal path. To quickly obtain a high-quality initial path and accelerate the convergence speed, we propose the NRRT*. It utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution and achieves better performance. The NRRT* can be also applied to other sampling-based algorithms for improved results in different applications.","date":"2020-10","shortTitle":"Neural RRT*","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","volume":"17","pages":"1748-1758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TASE.2020.2976560","issue":"4","ISSN":"1558-3783","creators":[{"firstName":"Jiankun","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenzheng","lastName":"Chi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chenming","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chaoqun","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Max Q.-H.","lastName":"Meng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Convergence","type":1},{"tag":"Convolutional neural network (CNN)","type":1},{"tag":"Convolutional neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"Nonuniform sampling","type":1},{"tag":"optimal path planning","type":1},{"tag":"sampling-based path planning","type":1}],"collections":["YE9SY9RF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T15:16:47Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T15:16:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QHPGIEHV","itemID":548,"attachments":[{"key":"FQ9UTV6T","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9037111?arnumber=9037111&tag=1","accessDate":"2022-05-23T15:17:12Z","parentItem":"QHPGIEHV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9037111.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T15:17:12Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T15:17:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FQ9UTV6T","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/FQ9UTV6T/9037111.html","defaultPath":"files/550/9037111.html"},{"key":"6982XC4A","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9037111&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTAzNzExMQ==","accessDate":"2022-05-23T15:16:51Z","parentItem":"QHPGIEHV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2020 - Neural RRT Learning-Based Optimal Path Planning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T15:16:51Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T15:16:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6982XC4A","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/6982XC4A/Wang et al. - 2020 - Neural RRT Learning-Based Optimal Path Planning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/549/Wang et al. - 2020 - Neural RRT Learning-Based Optimal Path Planning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762467,"version":0},"$loki":1170},{"itemID":1464,"item":{"key":"QHPZX2LA","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Path and trajectory diversity: Theory and algorithms","abstractNote":"We present heuristic algorithms for pruning large sets of candidate paths or trajectories down to smaller subsets that maintain desirable characteristics in terms of overall reachability and path length. Consider the example of a set of candidate paths in an environment that is the result of a forward search tree built over a set of actions or behaviors. The tree is precomputed and stored in memory to be used online to compute collision-free paths from the root of the tree to a particular goal node. In general, such a set of paths may be quite large, growing exponentially in the depth of the search tree. In practice, however, many of these paths may be close together and could be pruned without a loss to the overall problem of path-finding. The best such pruning for a given resulting tree size is the one that maximizes path diversity, which is quantified as the probability of the survival of paths, averaged over all possible obstacle environments. We formalize this notion and provide formulas for computing it exactly. We also present experimental results for two approximate algorithms for path set reduction that are efficient and yield desirable properties in terms of overall path diversity. The exact formulas and approximate algorithms generalize to the computation and maximization of spatio-temporal diversity for trajectories.","date":"2008-05","shortTitle":"Path and trajectory diversity","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"1359-1364","proceedingsTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","conferenceName":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI":"10.1109/ROBOT.2008.4543392","creators":[{"firstName":"Michael S.","lastName":"Branicky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ross A.","lastName":"Knepper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James J.","lastName":"Kuffner","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Robotics and automation","type":1},{"tag":"Robustness","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"Aircraft navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Runtime","type":1},{"tag":"Motion planning","type":1},{"tag":"Time factors","type":1},{"tag":"Tree graphs","type":1},{"tag":"USA Councils","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:58:05Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:58:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QHPZX2LA","itemID":1464,"attachments":[{"key":"MIE68HZB","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4543392?arnumber=4543392","accessDate":"2022-10-06T06:58:17Z","parentItem":"QHPZX2LA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"4543392.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:58:17Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:58:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/MIE68HZB","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/MIE68HZB/4543392.html","defaultPath":"files/1466/4543392.html"},{"key":"EDYKZJ5H","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4543392&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD9hcm51bWJlcj00NTQzMzky","accessDate":"2022-10-06T06:58:08Z","parentItem":"QHPZX2LA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Branicky et al. - 2008 - Path and trajectory diversity Theory and algorith.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:58:08Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:58:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EDYKZJ5H","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/EDYKZJ5H/Branicky et al. - 2008 - Path and trajectory diversity Theory and algorith.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1465/Branicky et al. - 2008 - Path and trajectory diversity Theory and algorith.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762469,"version":0},"$loki":1171},{"itemID":209,"item":{"key":"QJ9TKHUZ","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Optimal Path Planning for Autonomous Spraying UAS framework in Precision Agriculture","abstractNote":"This paper presents a novel guidance and control strategy for multirotor Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) which aims to provide an autonomous and safe mission in precision agriculture applications.

This characteristic is necessary for inspection robots that monitor the critical conditions of sectors in thermal, nuclear, and hydropower plants. This ability is also useful for applications such as service at home, victim rescue, museum guidance, land mine detection, and so forth. Multiple-target collision-free path planning is a topic that has not been very studied because of the complexity that it implies. Usually, this issue is left in second place because, commonly, it is solved by segmentation using the point-to-point strategy. Nevertheless, this approach exhibits a poor performance, in terms of path length, due to unnecessary turnings and redundant segments present in the found path. In this paper, a multiple-target method based on homotopy continuation capable to calculate a collision-free path in a single execution for complex environments is presented. This method exhibits a better performance, both in speed and efficiency, and robustness compared to the original Homotopic Path Planning Method (HPPM). Among the new schemes that improve their performance are the Double Spherical Tracking (DST), the dummy obstacle scheme, and a systematic criterion to a selection of repulsion parameter. The case studies show its effectiveness to find a solution path for office-like environments in just a few milliseconds, even if they have narrow corridors and hundreds of obstacles. Additionally, a comparison between the proposed method and sampling-based planning algorithms (SBP) with the best performance is presented. Furthermore, the results of case studies show that the proposed method exhibits a better performance than SBP algorithms for execution time, memory, and in some cases path length metrics.

However, large regions of the environment are typically benign enough that a much faster low-dimensional planning combined with a local path following controller suffice. Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality that was recently developed makes use of this observation and iteratively constructs and searches a state-space consisting of mainly low-dimensional states. It only introduces regions of high-dimensional states into the state-space where they are necessary to ensure completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. However, due to its iterative nature, the approach relies on running a series of weighted A* searches. In this paper, we introduce and apply to Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality a simple but very effective incremental version of weighted A* that reuses its previously generated search tree if available. On the theoretical side, the new algorithm preserves guarantees on completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. On the experimental side, it speeds up 3D (x,y,heading) path planning with a full-body collision checking by up to a factor of 5. Our results also show that it tends to be much faster than applying alternative incremental graph search techniques such as D* to Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality.","date":"2013-06-02","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ojs.aaai.org","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/13569","accessDate":"2022-07-14T13:21:50Z","rights":"Copyright (c) 2021 Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling","volume":"23","pages":"82-90","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling","ISSN":"2334-0843","creators":[{"firstName":"Kalin","lastName":"Gochev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alla","lastName":"Safonova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Incremental Graph Search","type":1}],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KUGCPDNW"]},"dateAdded":"2022-07-14T13:21:50Z","dateModified":"2022-07-18T10:51:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/QYQSHNLH","itemID":976,"attachments":[{"key":"4UUSCSSX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/download/13569/13418","accessDate":"2022-07-14T13:21:54Z","parentItem":"QYQSHNLH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gochev et al. - 2013 - Incremental Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-14T13:21:54Z","dateModified":"2022-07-14T13:21:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/4UUSCSSX","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/4UUSCSSX/Gochev et al. - 2013 - Incremental Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality.pdf","defaultPath":"files/977/Gochev et al. - 2013 - Incremental Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762475,"version":0},"$loki":1176},{"itemID":275,"item":{"key":"R7IGLRC9","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Adaptation of Lazy-Theta for UAS 3D path planning considering safety costs","abstractNote":"This paper presents a 3D path planning solution for UAS to obtain a safe and smooth path.

Homotopy classes of trajectories, arising due to the presence of obstacles, are deÔ¨Åned as sets of trajectories that can be transformed into each other by gradual bending and stretching without colliding with obstacles. The problem of Ô¨Ånding least-cost paths restricted to a speciÔ¨Åc homotopy class or Ô¨Ånding leastcost paths that do not belong to certain homotopy classes arises frequently in such applications as predicting paths for dynamic entities and computing heuristics for path planning with dynamic constraints. In the present work, we develop a compact way of representing homotopy classes and propose an efÔ¨Åcient method of graph search-based optimal path planning with constraints on homotopy classes. The method is based on representing the environment of the robot as a complex plane and making use of the Cauchy Integral Theorem.

However, controlling UAVs remotely in complex environments limits the capability of the UAVs and decreases the efficiency of the whole system. Therefore, many researchers are working on autonomous UAV navigation where UAVs can move and perform the assigned tasks based on their surroundings. With recent technological advancements, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has proliferated. Autonomous UAV navigation is an example of an application in which AI plays a critical role in providing fundamental human control characteristics. Thus, many researchers have adopted different AI approaches to make autonomous UAV navigation more efficient. This paper comprehensively surveys and categorizes several AI approaches for autonomous UAV navigation implicated by several researchers. Different AI approaches comprise mathematical-based optimization and model-based learning approaches. The fundamentals, working principles, and main features of the different optimization-based and learning-based approaches are discussed in this paper. In addition, the characteristics, types, navigation models, and applications of UAVs are highlighted to make AI implementation understandable.

For stable visual navigation, MAVs should generate perception-aware paths which guarantee enough visible landmarks. Many previous works on perception-aware path planning focused on sampling-based planners. However, they may suffer from sample inefficiency, which leads to computational burden for finding a global optimal path. To address this issue, we suggest a perception-aware path planner which utilizes topological information of environments. Since the topological class of a path and visible landmarks during traveling the path are closely related, the proposed algorithm checks distinctive topological classes to choose the class with abundant visual information. Topological graph is extracted from the generalized Voronoi diagram of the environment and initial paths with different topological classes are found. To evaluate the perception quality of the classes, we divide the initial path into discrete segments where the points in each segment share similar visual information. The optimal class with high perception quality is selected, and a graph-based planner is utilized to generate path within the class. With simulations and real-world experiments, we confirmed that the proposed method could guarantee accurate visual navigation compared with the perception-agnostic method while showing improved computational efficiency than the sampling-based perception-aware planner.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"3117-3124","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636469","creators":[{"firstName":"Dabin","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gyeong Chan","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Youngseok","lastName":"Jang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"H.

We show that this problem can be handled by appropriate refinements of methods introduced by A. Tarski [‚ÄúA Decision Method for Elementary Algebra and Geometry,‚Äù 2nd ed., Univ. of Calif.

Homotopy classes are generated and sorted according to a lower bound heuristic estimator using a method we developed. Then, the classes are used to constrain and guide path planning algorithms. Three different path planners are presented and compared: a graph-search algorithm called Homotopic A‚àó (HA‚àó), a probabilistic sample-based algorithm called Homotopic RRT (HRRT), and a bug-based algorithm called Homotopic Bug (HBug). Our method has been tested in simulation and in an underwater bathymetric map to compute the trajectory of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). A comparison with well-known path planning algorithms has also been included.

This path is unique and has some  canonical form. We use the representation of homotopy classes in a way that is as  general as the classical one. It consists in representing generators of a free group which  describes the classes of homotopy by disjoint cuts [GS97] homeomorphic to rays.

The homotopy classes are sorted according to an heuristic estimation of their lower bound. Then, a path planner based on the A*, called Homotopic A* (HA*), guides the path search in the workspace using the generated homotopy classes.

In this paper, the path planning consists of a global planner, that finds the optimal path, and in a local planner, recalculates the path to avoid obstacles. The main focus is to improve the performance of local planning techniques decreasing the complexity. There are two main ways to do it: bidirectional algorithms, improving time, and global planners, improving time and completeness. Thus, we propose a global planner algorithm that generates auxiliary nodes, backtracking by the goal node. We perform a comparison among A*, Bi A*, Artificial Potential Field (APF), Bi APF, Rapid Exploring Random Tree (RRT), and Bi RRT with and without the global planner through statistical metrics of time, path length, CPU, and memory. The results show the advantages of using bidirectional algorithms and the proposed global planner. The bidirectional algorithms decrease the time to return to the trajectory and sometimes assist in the algorithm's completeness. The proposed global planner reduced the planning time by 91.6% and improved the completeness of all algorithms in an unstructured indoor environment.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"688-697","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476692","creators":[{"firstName":"Lidia","lastName":"Rocha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marcela","lastName":"Aniceto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Ara√∫jo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kelen","lastName":"Vivaldini","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Three-dimensional displays","type":1},{"tag":"Approximation algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Focusing","type":1},{"tag":"Indoor environment","type":1},{"tag":"Measurement","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T08:48:04Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T08:48:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SA5W638B","itemID":200,"attachments":[{"key":"TQ45V5IL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476692/?arnumber=9476692","accessDate":"2022-04-21T08:48:16Z","parentItem":"SA5W638B","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476692.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T08:48:16Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T08:48:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TQ45V5IL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/TQ45V5IL/9476692.html","defaultPath":"files/202/9476692.html"},{"key":"ZCYB5MNX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476692&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3NjY5Mg==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T08:48:10Z","parentItem":"SA5W638B","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Rocha et al. - 2021 - A UAV Global Planner to Improve Path Planning in U.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T08:48:10Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T08:48:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ZCYB5MNX","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/ZCYB5MNX/Rocha et al. - 2021 - A UAV Global Planner to Improve Path Planning in U.pdf","defaultPath":"files/201/Rocha et al. - 2021 - A UAV Global Planner to Improve Path Planning in U.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762495,"version":0},"$loki":1193},{"itemID":1027,"item":{"key":"SAHGWLST","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Survey of Robot 3D Path Planning Algorithms","abstractNote":"Robot 3D (three-dimension) path planning targets for finding an optimal and collision-free path in a 3D workspace while taking into account kinematic constraints (including geometric, physical, and temporal constraints).

Despite the recent increasing attention to data-driven path planning, machine learning approaches to search-based planning are still challenging due to the discrete nature of search algorithms. In this work, we reformulate a canonical A* search algorithm to be differentiable and couple it with a convolutional encoder to form an end-to-end trainable neural network planner. Neural A* solves a path planning problem by encoding a problem instance to a guidance map and then performing the differentiable A* search with the guidance map. By learning to match the search results with ground-truth paths provided by experts, Neural A* can produce a path consistent with the ground truth accurately and efficiently. Our extensive experiments confirmed that Neural A* outperformed state-of-the-art data-driven planners in terms of the search optimality and efficiency trade-off. Furthermore, Neural A* successfully predicted realistic human trajectories by directly performing search-based planning on natural image inputs.

Three sampling-based planning approaches are converted to topology-aware planners and compared to another that employs the SPARS2 path planning algorithm. We report on the number of coarse pathways found, computation time, and average path length and show that our approach outperformed previously published path diversity algorithms.","date":"2021-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"6552-6557","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636714","creators":[{"firstName":"Aakriti","lastName":"Upadhyay","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Goldfarb","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chinwe","lastName":"Ekenna","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Intelligent robots","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:32:27Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:32:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SJS66KEP","itemID":453,"attachments":[{"key":"SCXI44A6","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636714?arnumber=9636714","accessDate":"2022-05-18T13:32:43Z","parentItem":"SJS66KEP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9636714.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:32:43Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:32:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SCXI44A6","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SCXI44A6/9636714.html","defaultPath":"files/455/9636714.html"},{"key":"9BK7X79E","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9636714&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTYzNjcxNA==","accessDate":"2022-05-18T13:32:29Z","parentItem":"SJS66KEP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Upadhyay et al. - 2021 - A Topological Approach to Finding Coarsely Diverse.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T13:32:29Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T13:32:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9BK7X79E","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/9BK7X79E/Upadhyay et al. - 2021 - A Topological Approach to Finding Coarsely Diverse.pdf","defaultPath":"files/454/Upadhyay et al. - 2021 - A Topological Approach to Finding Coarsely Diverse.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762498,"version":0},"$loki":1196},{"itemID":65,"item":{"key":"SMUPJT5V","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Comprehensive simulation of quadrotor UAVs using ROS and gazebo","abstractNote":"Quadrotor UAVs have successfully been used both in research and for commercial applications in recent years and there has been significant progress in the design of robust control software and hardware.

Unlike existing solutions, the presented system is integrated with ROS and the Gazebo simulator. This comprehensive approach allows simultaneous simulation of diverse aspects such as flight dynamics, onboard sensors like IMUs, external imaging sensors and complex environments. The dynamics model of the quadrotor has been parameterized using wind tunnel tests and validated by a comparison of simulated and real flight data.

Our objective is to return a good estimate of the optimal value function at any state while minimizing the number of calls to the generative model, i.e. the sample complexity. We propose a new algorithm, TrailBlazer, able to handle MDPs with a finite or an infinite number of transitions from state-action to next states. TrailBlazer is an adaptive algorithm that exploits possible structures of the MDP by exploring only a subset of states reachable by following near-optimal policies. We provide bounds on its sample complexity that depend on a measure of the quantity of near-optimal states. The algorithm behavior can be considered as an extension of Monte-Carlo sampling (for estimating an expectation) to problems that alternate maximization (over actions) and expectation (over next states). Finally, another appealing feature of TrailBlazer is that it is simple to implement and computationally efficient.","date":"2016","shortTitle":"Blazing the trails before beating the path","libraryCatalog":"Neural Information Processing Systems","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/hash/7b4773c039d539af17c883eb9283dd14-Abstract.html","accessDate":"2022-06-24T15:02:04Z","volume":"29","publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","proceedingsTitle":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Jean-Bastien","lastName":"Grill","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Valko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Remi","lastName":"Munos","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T15:02:04Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T15:02:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SPADDD6D","itemID":872,"attachments":[{"key":"WK8QCZKE","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/file/7b4773c039d539af17c883eb9283dd14-Paper.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-24T15:02:05Z","parentItem":"SPADDD6D","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Grill et al. - 2016 - Blazing the trails before beating the path Sample.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T15:02:05Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T15:02:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WK8QCZKE","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WK8QCZKE/Grill et al. - 2016 - Blazing the trails before beating the path Sample.pdf","defaultPath":"files/873/Grill et al. - 2016 - Blazing the trails before beating the path Sample.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762500,"version":0},"$loki":1199},{"itemID":930,"item":{"key":"SQJVY5CN","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Motion planning with sequential convex optimization and convex collision checking","abstractNote":"We present a new optimization-based approach for robotic motion planning among obstacles.

However, these methods are limited in the sense that they can be trained only on fully labeled data. Due to various challenges in obtaining real world fully-labeled image deraining datasets, existing methods are trained only on synthetically generated data and hence, generalize poorly to real-world images. The use of real-world data in training image deraining networks is relatively less explored in the literature. We propose a Gaussian Process-based semi-supervised learning framework which enables the network in learning to derain using synthetic dataset while generalizing better using unlabeled real-world images. Through extensive experiments and ablations on several challenging datasets (such as Rain800, Rain200H and DDN-SIRR), we show that the proposed method, when trained on limited labeled data, achieves on-par performance with fully-labeled training. Additionally, we demonstrate that using unlabeled real-world images in the proposed GP-based framework results in superior performance as compared to existing methods.

We present a new simulator built on Unreal Engine that offers physically and visually realistic simulations for both of these goals. Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software components with real-world flights.","date":"2017-07-18","shortTitle":"AirSim","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05065","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:17:13Z","extra":"arXiv: 1705.05065","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1705.05065 [cs]","creators":[{"firstName":"Shital","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Debadeepta","lastName":"Dey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Lovett","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Kapoor","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1},{"tag":"Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"}],"collections":["WW2UCAPM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:17:13Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T17:06:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TB3JM7KM","itemID":30,"attachments":[{"key":"JAR3CHPI","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05065.pdf","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:17:29Z","parentItem":"TB3JM7KM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Shah et al. - 2017 - AirSim High-Fidelity Visual and Physical Simulati.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:17:29Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:17:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JAR3CHPI","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/JAR3CHPI/Shah et al. - 2017 - AirSim High-Fidelity Visual and Physical Simulati.pdf","defaultPath":"files/32/Shah et al. - 2017 - AirSim High-Fidelity Visual and Physical Simulati.pdf"},{"key":"7IUN7G7P","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05065","accessDate":"2022-04-19T14:17:34Z","parentItem":"TB3JM7KM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1705.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:17:34Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:17:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7IUN7G7P","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/7IUN7G7P/1705.html","defaultPath":"files/33/1705.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"NYGTAJYU","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"TB3JM7KM","note":"Comment: Accepted for Field and Service Robotics conference 2017 (FSR 2017)","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T14:17:13Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T14:17:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NYGTAJYU"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762506,"version":0},"$loki":1206},{"itemID":108,"item":{"key":"TFIINYVQ","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Robust and Efficient Quadrotor Trajectory Generation for Fast Autonomous Flight","abstractNote":"In this letter, we propose a robust and efficient quadrotor motion planning system for fast flight in three-dimensional complex environments.

As the complexity and randomness of robot application scenarios increase, the planning capability of the classical hierarchical motion planners is challenged. With the development of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based motion planner has gradually become a research hotspot due to its several advantageous features. DRL-based motion planner is model-free and does not rely on the prior structured map. Most importantly, DRL-based motion planner achieves the unification of the global planner and the local planner. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of various motion planning methods. First, we summarize the representative and state-of-the-art works for each submodule of the classical motion planning architecture and analyze their performance features. Subsequently, we concentrate on summarizing RL-based motion planning approaches, including motion planners combined with RL improvements, map-free RL-based motion planners, and multi-robot cooperative planning methods. Last but not least, we analyze the urgent challenges faced by these mainstream RL-based motion planners in detail, review some state-of-the-art works for these issues, and propose suggestions for future research.","date":"2022-02-22","shortTitle":"A review of mobile robot motion planning methods","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13619","accessDate":"2022-08-09T15:01:27Z","extra":"arXiv:2108.13619 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2108.13619","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:2108.13619","creators":[{"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Dong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zichen","lastName":"He","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chunwei","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Changyin","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"}],"collections":["XEGDLIT3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T15:01:27Z","dateModified":"2022-08-10T08:58:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TIQGSI45","itemID":1092,"attachments":[{"key":"ZE5QEBF5","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13619.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-09T15:01:31Z","parentItem":"TIQGSI45","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Dong et al. - 2022 - A review of mobile robot motion planning methods .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T15:01:31Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T15:01:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ZE5QEBF5","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/ZE5QEBF5/Dong et al. - 2022 - A review of mobile robot motion planning methods .pdf","defaultPath":"files/1093/Dong et al. - 2022 - A review of mobile robot motion planning methods .pdf"},{"key":"X6WL9SFC","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13619","accessDate":"2022-08-09T15:01:36Z","parentItem":"TIQGSI45","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2108.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-09T15:01:36Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T15:01:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/X6WL9SFC","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/X6WL9SFC/2108.html","defaultPath":"files/1094/2108.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762509,"version":0},"$loki":1210},{"itemID":471,"item":{"key":"TKFZRIK4","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Exploration-RRT: A multi-objective Path Planning and Exploration Framework for Unknown and Unstructured Environments","abstractNote":"This article establishes the Exploration-RRT algorithm: A novel general-purpose combined exploration and path planning algorithm, based on a multi-goal Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) framework.

Checking collision with obstacles is the major computational bottleneck in this process. We propose new learning-based methods for reducing collision checking to accelerate motion planning by training graph neural networks (GNNs) that perform path exploration and path smoothing. Given random geometric graphs (RGGs) generated from batch sampling, the path exploration component iteratively predicts collision-free edges to prioritize their exploration. The path smoothing component then optimizes paths obtained from the exploration stage. The methods benefit from the ability of GNNs of capturing geometric patterns from RGGs through batch sampling and generalize better to unseen environments. Experimental results show that the learned components can significantly reduce collision checking and improve overall planning efficiency in challenging high-dimensional motion planning tasks.","date":"2021","libraryCatalog":"Neural Information Processing Systems","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/224e5e49814ca908e58c02e28a0462c1-Abstract.html","accessDate":"2022-06-24T12:51:05Z","volume":"34","publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","pages":"4274‚Äì4289","proceedingsTitle":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Chenning","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sicun","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T12:51:05Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T12:51:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TKGBTGE5","itemID":850,"attachments":[{"key":"T3HE9UP7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/file/224e5e49814ca908e58c02e28a0462c1-Paper.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-24T12:51:08Z","parentItem":"TKGBTGE5","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yu and Gao - 2021 - Reducing Collision Checking for Sampling-Based Mot.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T12:51:08Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T12:51:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/T3HE9UP7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/T3HE9UP7/Yu and Gao - 2021 - Reducing Collision Checking for Sampling-Based Mot.pdf","defaultPath":"files/851/Yu and Gao - 2021 - Reducing Collision Checking for Sampling-Based Mot.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762511,"version":0},"$loki":1212},{"itemID":1024,"item":{"key":"TMP68W8Z","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots: A Review","abstractNote":"Providing mobile robots with autonomous capabilities is advantageous. It allows one to dispense with the intervention of human operators, which may prove beneficial in economic and safety terms. Autonomy requires, in most cases, the use of path planners that enable the robot to deliberate about how to move from its location at one moment to another. Looking for the most appropriate path planning algorithm according to the requirements imposed by users can be challenging, given the overwhelming number of approaches that exist in the literature. Moreover, the past review works analyzed here cover only some of these approaches, missing important ones. For this reason, our paper aims to serve as a starting point for a clear and comprehensive overview of the research to date. It introduces a global classification of path planning algorithms, with a focus on those approaches used along with autonomous ground vehicles, but is also extendable to other robots moving on surfaces, such as autonomous boats. Moreover, the models used to represent the environment, together with the robot mobility and dynamics, are also addressed from the perspective of path planning. Each of the path planning categories presented in the classification is disclosed and analyzed, and a discussion about their applicability is added at the end.","date":"2021/1","language":"en","shortTitle":"Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/23/7898","accessDate":"2022-07-28T15:31:21Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 23\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"21","pages":"7898","publicationTitle":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s21237898","issue":"23","ISSN":"1424-8220","creators":[{"firstName":"Jos√© Ricardo","lastName":"S√°nchez-Ib√°√±ez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carlos J.","lastName":"P√©rez-del-Pulgar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Garc√≠a-Cerezo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"guidance","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"üî•"},{"tag":"üìö"},{"tag":"autonomy","type":1},{"tag":"graph search","type":1},{"tag":"route","type":1},{"tag":"sampling","type":1},{"tag":"survey","type":1},{"tag":"trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"vehicle","type":1},{"tag":"wheeled","type":1}],"collections":["XEGDLIT3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T15:31:21Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T15:09:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TMP68W8Z","itemID":1024,"attachments":[{"key":"WINATDC8","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/23/7898/pdf?version=1638260371","accessDate":"2022-07-28T15:31:21Z","parentItem":"TMP68W8Z","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"S√°nchez-Ib√°√±ez et al. - 2021 - Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots A Revi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T15:31:21Z","dateModified":"2022-07-28T15:31:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WINATDC8","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WINATDC8/S√°nchez-Ib√°√±ez et al. - 2021 - Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots A Revi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1025/S√°nchez-Ib√°√±ez et al. - 2021 - Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots A Revi.pdf"},{"key":"RH8DYKF5","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/23/7898","accessDate":"2022-07-28T15:31:27Z","parentItem":"TMP68W8Z","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7898.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T15:31:27Z","dateModified":"2022-07-28T15:31:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/RH8DYKF5","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/RH8DYKF5/7898.html","defaultPath":"files/1026/7898.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"2XRXH83P","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"TMP68W8Z","note":"<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p>Focuses on classical algorithms.</p>\n</div>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-08T10:35:52Z","dateModified":"2022-08-08T10:36:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2XRXH83P"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762512,"version":0},"$loki":1213},{"itemID":221,"item":{"key":"TT6BBJUG","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Neural Network Based Algorithm for Multi-UAV Coverage Path Planning","abstractNote":"This paper proposes a method to tackle the Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem for a fleet of AI-driven UAVs while accounting for congestion, collision avoidance, and efficiency of the path. The algorithm relies on a mixed-use of decentralized Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the A* pathfinder. Each UAV has elementary cognitive skills to sense information about the nearby environment which are then fed as an input to the network. The neural network creates a correlation between the current state of a UAV and the best action to take at each time step. The exploration strategy is stored in a labeled database for the single-UAV case; the neural network learns and replicates it in the multi-UAV case, being able to generalize the acquired skills over new maps not contained in the database. The training session imitates human priors in a multi-class classification, which completely bypasses common drawbacks such as the need for large databases or high computational resources. The case study focuses on complex urban areas, for which the grid resolution of the traditional approaches can't model the problem with sufficient accuracy.","date":"2021-06","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2575-7296","pages":"1210-1217","proceedingsTitle":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","conferenceName":"2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476864","creators":[{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Sanna","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Godio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Guglieri","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"UAV","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Training","type":1},{"tag":"Computational modeling","type":1},{"tag":"Artificial Intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"Artificial neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"Correlation","type":1},{"tag":"Databases","type":1},{"tag":"Neural Network","type":1},{"tag":"Supervised Imitation Learning","type":1},{"tag":"Urban areas","type":1},{"tag":"Urban Coverage Path Planning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T09:13:16Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T09:13:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TT6BBJUG","itemID":221,"attachments":[{"key":"7GCBGFCY","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476864/?arnumber=9476864","accessDate":"2022-04-21T09:13:30Z","parentItem":"TT6BBJUG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9476864.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T09:13:30Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T09:13:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/7GCBGFCY","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/7GCBGFCY/9476864.html","defaultPath":"files/223/9476864.html"},{"key":"V3MJHKYH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476864&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQ3Njg2NA==","accessDate":"2022-04-21T09:13:19Z","parentItem":"TT6BBJUG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sanna et al. - 2021 - Neural Network Based Algorithm for Multi-UAV Cover.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-21T09:13:19Z","dateModified":"2022-04-21T09:13:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/V3MJHKYH","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/V3MJHKYH/Sanna et al. - 2021 - Neural Network Based Algorithm for Multi-UAV Cover.pdf","defaultPath":"files/222/Sanna et al. - 2021 - Neural Network Based Algorithm for Multi-UAV Cover.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762513,"version":0},"$loki":1214},{"itemID":595,"item":{"key":"TZ4QTRGF","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Motion Planning for Mobile Robots‚ÄîFocusing on Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Review","abstractNote":"Mobile robots contributed significantly to the intelligent development of human society, and the motion-planning policy is critical for mobile robots.

Through the combination of sampling-based planning, a Rapidly Exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) and an efficient kinodynamic motion planner through machine learning, we propose an efficient solution to long-range planning for kinodynamic motion planning. First, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn an obstacle-avoiding policy that maps a robot's sensor observations to actions, which is used as a local planner during planning and as a controller during execution. Second, we train a reachability estimator in a supervised manner, which predicts the RL policy's time to reach a state in the presence of obstacles. Lastly, we introduce RL-RRT that uses the RL policy as a local planner, and the reachability estimator as the distance function to bias tree-growth towards promising regions. We evaluate our method on three kinodynamic systems, including physical robot experiments. Results across all three robots tested indicate that RL-RRT outperforms state of the art kinodynamic planners in efficiency, and also provides a shorter path finish time than a steering function free method. The learned local planner policy and accompanying reachability estimator demonstrate transferability to the previously unseen experimental environments, making RL-RRT fast because the expensive computations are replaced with simple neural network inference.","date":"2019-10","shortTitle":"RL-RRT","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","volume":"4","pages":"4298-4305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LRA.2019.2931199","issue":"4","ISSN":"2377-3766","creators":[{"firstName":"Hao-Tien Lewis","lastName":"Chiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jasmine","lastName":"Hsu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Fiser","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lydia","lastName":"Tapia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Faust","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Robot sensing systems","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Motion and path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Noise measurement","type":1},{"tag":"Training","type":1},{"tag":"Laser radar","type":1},{"tag":"learning and adaptive systems","type":1},{"tag":"deep learning in robotics and automation","type":1}],"collections":["MKUGZUF7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-08T15:23:46Z","dateModified":"2022-09-08T15:23:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/U99Y6QN6","itemID":1350,"attachments":[{"key":"RHJLMECF","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8772207","accessDate":"2022-09-08T15:23:58Z","parentItem":"U99Y6QN6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8772207.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-08T15:23:58Z","dateModified":"2022-09-08T15:23:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/RHJLMECF","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/RHJLMECF/8772207.html","defaultPath":"files/1352/8772207.html"},{"key":"997DJTPC","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/7083369/8764082/08772207.pdf?tp=&arnumber=8772207&isnumber=8764082&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50Lzg3NzIyMDc=","accessDate":"2022-09-08T15:23:50Z","parentItem":"U99Y6QN6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chiang et al. - 2019 - RL-RRT Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Learning R.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-08T15:23:50Z","dateModified":"2022-09-08T15:23:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/997DJTPC","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/997DJTPC/Chiang et al. - 2019 - RL-RRT Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Learning R.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1351/Chiang et al. - 2019 - RL-RRT Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Learning R.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762515,"version":0},"$loki":1216},{"itemID":546,"item":{"key":"U9QLW6UG","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Intelligent B√©zier curve-based path planning model using Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","abstractNote":"Path planning algorithms have been used in different applications with the aim of finding a suitable collision-free path which satisfies some certain criteria such as the shortest path length and smoothness; thus, defining a suitable curve to describe path is essential. The main goal of these algorithms is to find the shortest and smooth path between the starting and target points. This paper makes use of a B√©zier curve-based model for path planning. The control points of the B√©zier curve significantly influence the length and smoothness of the path. In this paper, a novel Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) algorithm has been proposed to optimize the control points of B√©zier curve, and the proposed algorithm comes in two variants: CPSO-I and CPSO-II. Using the chosen control points, the optimum smooth path that minimizes the total distance between the starting and ending points is selected. To evaluate the CPSO algorithm, the results of the CPSO-I and CPSO-II algorithms are compared with the standard PSO algorithm. The experimental results proved that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding the optimal path. Moreover, the CPSO algorithm was tested against different numbers of control points and obstacles, and the CPSO algorithm achieved competitive results.","date":"2019-03-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-018-2360-3","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:55:43Z","volume":"22","pages":"4745-4766","publicationTitle":"Cluster Computing","DOI":"10.1007/s10586-018-2360-3","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Cluster Comput","ISSN":"1573-7543","creators":[{"firstName":"Alaa","lastName":"Tharwat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elhoseny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aboul Ella","lastName":"Hassanien","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gabel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"B√©zier curve","type":1},{"tag":"Chaos","type":1},{"tag":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:55:43Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:55:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/U9QLW6UG","itemID":546,"attachments":[{"key":"HF439VPR","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10586-018-2360-3.pdf","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:55:44Z","parentItem":"U9QLW6UG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Tharwat et al. - 2019 - Intelligent B√©zier curve-based path planning model.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:55:44Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:55:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/HF439VPR","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HF439VPR/Tharwat et al. - 2019 - Intelligent B√©zier curve-based path planning model.pdf","defaultPath":"files/547/Tharwat et al. - 2019 - Intelligent B√©zier curve-based path planning model.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762515,"version":0},"$loki":1217},{"itemID":90,"item":{"key":"UAV6HEUR","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Camera-based navigation of a low-cost quadrocopter","abstractNote":"In this paper, we describe a system that enables a low-cost quadrocopter coupled with a ground-based laptop to navigate autonomously in previously unknown and GPS-denied environments.

In an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that our system is able to navigate in previously unknown environments at absolute scale without requiring artificial markers or external sensors.

Since centralized, coupled planning algorithms are computationally intractable for large numbers of robots, we consider decoupled planning, in which robots plan their paths sequentially in order of priority. Choosing how to prioritize the robots is a key consideration. State-of-the-art prioritization heuristics, however, do not model the coupling between a robot's mobility and its environment. This is particularly relevant when prioritizing between robots with different degrees of mobility. In this paper, we propose a prioritization rule that can be computed online by each robot independently, and that provides consistent, conflict-free path plans. Our innovation is to formalize a robot's path prospects to reach its goal from its current location. To this end, we consider the number of homology classes of trajectories, which capture distinct prospects of paths for each robot. This measure is used as a prioritization rule, whenever any robots enter negotiation to deconflict path plans. We perform simulations with heterogeneous robot teams and compare our method to five benchmarks. Our method achieves the highest success rate, and strikes a good balance between makespan and flowtime objectives.","date":"2020-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2577-087X","pages":"9809-9815","proceedingsTitle":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","conferenceName":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196813","creators":[{"firstName":"Wenying","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amanda","lastName":"Prorok","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Robot kinematics","type":1},{"tag":"Couplings","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-14T08:42:48Z","dateModified":"2022-10-04T11:13:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/UBR78NUA","itemID":1379,"attachments":[{"key":"F2M5MZ3B","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9196813","accessDate":"2022-09-14T08:43:01Z","parentItem":"UBR78NUA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9196813.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-14T08:43:01Z","dateModified":"2022-09-14T08:43:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/F2M5MZ3B","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/F2M5MZ3B/9196813.html","defaultPath":"files/1381/9196813.html"},{"key":"EJ4I4D4U","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9196813&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50LzkxOTY4MTM=","accessDate":"2022-09-14T08:42:51Z","parentItem":"UBR78NUA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wu et al. - 2020 - Multi-Robot Path Deconfliction through Prioritizat.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-14T08:42:51Z","dateModified":"2022-09-14T08:42:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EJ4I4D4U","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/EJ4I4D4U/Wu et al. - 2020 - Multi-Robot Path Deconfliction through Prioritizat.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1380/Wu et al. - 2020 - Multi-Robot Path Deconfliction through Prioritizat.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762517,"version":0},"$loki":1219},{"itemID":224,"item":{"key":"UDRYQ43W","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"An approach for coverage path planning for UAVs","abstractNote":"In this paper, an offline flight planner that computes an efficient coverage trajectory for a quad-rotors UAV is presented.

This paper promotes an image enhancement method and is dedicated to reduce the adverse effects of blurred images on vision systems. We first researched the theory of indented frame over fusion (IFOF) and presented an automatic screening function. Then subtly combined color reversal, registration and transformation. Lastly, we tested two examples with this method and gained good results. Image processed by this method, facing strong scattering of light environment, has improved its quality and visual effects.

Given a set of trajectories sampled from a space we construct a basis for compression whose elements correspond to paths in the space which are topologically distinct. This is achieved by computing a canonical representative for each element in a generating set for the first homology group and decomposing these representatives into a set of distinct paths. Trajectory compression is subsequently accomplished through representation in terms of this basis. Robustness with respect to outliers is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist in the super-level sets of the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) above a threshold. Robustness with respect to small scale topological artifacts is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist for a sufficient range in the super-level sets. We demonstrate this approach to trajectory compression in the context of a large set of crowd-sourced GPS trajectories captured in the city of Chicago. On this set, the compression method achieves a mean geometrical accuracy of 108 meters with a compression ratio of over 12.","date":"2016-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"3126-3132","proceedingsTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","conferenceName":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487479","creators":[{"firstName":"Padraig","lastName":"Corcoran","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Mooney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guoquan","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Robustness","type":1},{"tag":"Global Positioning System","type":1},{"tag":"Estimation","type":1},{"tag":"Urban areas","type":1},{"tag":"Kernel","type":1},{"tag":"Context","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T11:16:35Z","dateModified":"2022-09-16T11:16:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ULXR9HCE","itemID":1422,"attachments":[{"key":"XWTLEVE9","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487479","accessDate":"2022-09-16T11:16:48Z","parentItem":"ULXR9HCE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7487479.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T11:16:48Z","dateModified":"2022-09-16T11:16:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XWTLEVE9","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XWTLEVE9/7487479.html","defaultPath":"files/1424/7487479.html"},{"key":"GP94IKPC","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487479&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50Lzc0ODc0Nzk=","accessDate":"2022-09-16T11:16:37Z","parentItem":"ULXR9HCE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Corcoran et al. - 2016 - Unsupervised trajectory compression.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T11:16:37Z","dateModified":"2022-09-16T11:16:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GP94IKPC","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/GP94IKPC/Corcoran et al. - 2016 - Unsupervised trajectory compression.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1423/Corcoran et al. - 2016 - Unsupervised trajectory compression.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762519,"version":0},"$loki":1222},{"itemID":502,"item":{"key":"UPEF659R","version":0,"itemType":"bookSection","title":"Polynomial Trajectory Planning for Aggressive Quadrotor Flight in Dense Indoor Environments","abstractNote":"We explore the challenges of planning trajectories for quadrotors through cluttered indoor environments. We extend the existing work on polynomial trajectory generation by presenting a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path segments in an unconstrained quadratic program that is numerically stable for highorder polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for efÔ¨Åcient sparse computation. We also present a technique for automatically selecting the amount of time allocated to each segment, and hence the quadrotor speeds along the path, as a function of a single parameter determining aggressiveness, subject to actuator constraints. The use of polynomial trajectories, coupled with the differentially Ô¨Çat representation of the quadrotor, eliminates the need for computationally intensive sampling and simulation in the high dimensional state space of the vehicle during motion planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based optimal kinodynamic planning methods, but sacriÔ¨Åces the guarantee of asymptotic convergence to the global optimum that those methods provide. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by efÔ¨Åciently generating trajectories through challenging indoor spaces and successfully traversing them at speeds up to 8 m/s.

Knowledge of robot homotopic groups gives information regarding the obstacle structure and enables timely computation of optimal path. Making a roadmap which misses out on a single homotopic group in such approaches may lead to sub-optimal decisions. E.g. one may prefer to go through a very narrow corridor if that reduces the path length significantly, but not if the resulting path has too many such narrow segments. Similarly knowledge of homotopic groups may enable distribution and scheduling of robots across homotopic groups for decentralized planning of multiple robots. For an unstructured robot environment, sampling based approaches give an insight into homotopic groups. The aim of the work is to make a homotopy conscious Probabilistic Roadmap such that the roadmap is capable of generating paths corresponding to as many homotopic groups as possible.

To address this problem, most existing algorithms are based on supervised learning methods to learn an automatic photo enhancer for paired data, which consists of low-quality photos and corresponding expert-retouched versions. However, the style and characteristics of photos retouched by experts may not meet the needs or preferences of general users. In this paper, we present an unsupervised image enhancement generative adversarial network (UEGAN), which learns the corresponding image-to-image mapping from a set of images with desired characteristics in an unsupervised manner, rather than learning on a large number of paired images. The proposed model is based on single deep GAN which embeds the modulation and attention mechanisms to capture richer global and local features. Based on the proposed model, we introduce two losses to deal with the unsupervised image enhancement: (1) fidelity loss, which is defined as a ‚Ñì2 regularization in the feature domain of a pre-trained VGG network to ensure the content between the enhanced image and the input image is the same, and (2) quality loss that is formulated as a relativistic hinge adversarial loss to endow the input image the desired characteristics. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed model effectively improves the aesthetic quality of images.

Specifically, localization is performed by exploiting a scan matching approach based on a customized version of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm, while mapping is done by extracting robust line features from LIDAR measurements. A peculiarity of the line detection method is the use of the Principal Component Analysis which allows computational time saving with respect to traditional least squares techniques for line fitting.

However, due to the power and payload constraints of aerial platforms, state estimation algorithms must provide these qualities under the computational constraints of embedded hardware. Cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) satisfy these power and payload constraints, so visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithms are popular choices for state estimation in these scenarios, in addition to their ability to operate without external localization from motion capture or global positioning systems. It is not clear from existing results in the literature, however, which VIO algorithms perform well under the accuracy, latency, and computational constraints of a flying robot with onboard state estimation. This paper evaluates an array of publicly-available VIO pipelines (MSCKF, OKVIS, ROVIO, VINS-Mono, SVO+MSF, and SVO+GTSAM) on different hardware configurations, including several single-board computer systems that are typically found on flying robots. The evaluation considers the pose estimation accuracy, per-frame processing time, and CPU and memory load while processing the EuRoC datasets, which contain six degree of freedom (6DoF) trajectories typical of flying robots.

In approaches that ignore the time dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is unavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally sub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness, it is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of adaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion planning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the context of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the idea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic environments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model. Specifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions of the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a low-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete and is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost sub-optimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of 3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show that the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over 4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates significantly from the one suggested by the heuristic.","date":"2016","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ojs.aaai.org","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/view/18386","accessDate":"2022-07-14T12:43:55Z","rights":"Copyright (c) 2021 Proceedings of the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search","extra":"Number: 1","volume":"7","pages":"107-115","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search","issue":"1","creators":[{"firstName":"Anirudh","lastName":"Vemula","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katharina","lastName":"Muelling","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Oh","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Path Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Adaptive Dimensionality","type":1},{"tag":"Dynamic Environments","type":1}],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KUGCPDNW"]},"dateAdded":"2022-07-14T12:43:55Z","dateModified":"2022-07-14T15:48:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VNSLIQKT","itemID":972,"attachments":[{"key":"2W8GHKV9","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/download/18386/18177","accessDate":"2022-07-14T12:43:59Z","parentItem":"VNSLIQKT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Vemula et al. - 2016 - Path Planning in Dynamic Environments with Adaptiv.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-14T12:43:59Z","dateModified":"2022-07-14T12:43:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/2W8GHKV9","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/2W8GHKV9/Vemula et al. - 2016 - Path Planning in Dynamic Environments with Adaptiv.pdf","defaultPath":"files/973/Vemula et al. - 2016 - Path Planning in Dynamic Environments with Adaptiv.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762534,"version":0},"$loki":1235},{"itemID":936,"item":{"key":"VNSPTTZK","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Maths for Intelligent Systems","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"112","creators":[{"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Toussaint","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-29T10:58:04Z","dateModified":"2022-06-29T10:58:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VNSPTTZK","itemID":936,"attachments":[{"key":"CDAWEX8N","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Toussaint - Maths for Intelligent Systems.pdf","url":"https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/Lecture-Maths.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-29T10:58:03Z","parentItem":"VNSPTTZK","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Toussaint - Maths for Intelligent Systems.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-29T10:58:03Z","dateModified":"2022-06-29T10:58:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/CDAWEX8N","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/CDAWEX8N/Toussaint - Maths for Intelligent Systems.pdf","defaultPath":"files/935/Toussaint - Maths for Intelligent Systems.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762534,"version":0},"$loki":1236},{"itemID":1482,"item":{"key":"VUIM9BZ2","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Methods for image denoising using convolutional neural network: a review","abstractNote":"Image denoising faces significant challenges, arising from the sources of noise.

To improve the runtime of motion planning algorithms, we propose to nest robots in each other, creating a nested quotient-space decomposition of the configuration space. Based on this decomposition we define a new roadmap-based motion planning algorithm called the Quotient-space roadMap Planner (QMP). The algorithm starts growing a graph on the lowest dimensional quotient space, switches to the next quotient space once a valid path has been found, and keeps updating the graphs on each quotient space simultaneously until a valid path in the configuration space has been found. We show that this algorithm is probabilistically complete and outperforms a set of state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in the open motion planning library (OMPL).","date":"2018-08-03","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09468","accessDate":"2022-10-17T09:43:38Z","extra":"arXiv:1807.09468 [cs]","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1807.09468","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:1807.09468","creators":[{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Orthey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Escande","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eiichi","lastName":"Yoshida","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-17T09:43:38Z","dateModified":"2022-10-17T09:43:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VYFXKAHP","itemID":1532,"attachments":[{"key":"TAU2Q6GY","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09468.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-17T09:43:41Z","parentItem":"VYFXKAHP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Orthey et al. - 2018 - Quotient-Space Motion Planning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-17T09:43:41Z","dateModified":"2022-10-17T09:43:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/TAU2Q6GY","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/TAU2Q6GY/Orthey et al. - 2018 - Quotient-Space Motion Planning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1533/Orthey et al. - 2018 - Quotient-Space Motion Planning.pdf"},{"key":"L5Q9GIZ7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09468","accessDate":"2022-10-17T09:43:46Z","parentItem":"VYFXKAHP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1807.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-17T09:43:46Z","dateModified":"2022-10-17T09:43:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/L5Q9GIZ7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/L5Q9GIZ7/1807.html","defaultPath":"files/1534/1807.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762536,"version":0},"$loki":1238},{"itemID":537,"item":{"key":"VYJCWY7H","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A new genetic algorithm approach to smooth path planning for mobile robots","abstractNote":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to consider the smooth path planning problem for a mobile robot based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and the Bezier curve. Design/methodology/approach The workspace of a mobile robot is described by a new grid-based representation that facilitates the operations of the adopted GA. The chromosome of the GA is composed of a sequence of binary numbered grids (i.e. control points of the Bezier curve). Ordinary genetic operators including crossover and mutation are used to search the optimum chromosome where the optimization criterion is the length of a piecewise collision-free Bezier curve path determined by the control points. Findings This paper has proposed a new smooth path planning for a mobile robot by resorting to the GA and the Bezier curve. A new grid-based representation of the workspace has been presented, which makes it convenient to perform operations in the GA. The GA has been used to search the optimum control points that determine the Bezier curve-based smooth path. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified by a numerical experiment, and some performances of the obtained method have also been analyzed. Research limitations/implications There still remain many interesting topics, for example, how to solve the specific smooth path planning problem by using the GA and how to promote the computational efficiency in the more grids case. These issues deserve further research. Originality/value The purpose of this paper is to improve the existing results by making the following three distinctive contributions: a rigorous mathematical formulation of the path planning optimization problem is formulated; a general grid-based representation (2n √ó 2n) is proposed to describe the workspace of the mobile robots to facilitate the implementation of the GA where n is chosen according to the trade-off between the accuracy and the computational burden; and the control points of the Bezier curve are directly linked to the optimization criteria so that the generated paths are guaranteed to be optimal without any need for smoothing afterwards.","date":"2016-01-01","libraryCatalog":"Emerald Insight","url":"https://doi.org/10.1108/AA-11-2015-094","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:47:10Z","extra":"Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","volume":"36","pages":"138-145","publicationTitle":"Assembly Automation","DOI":"10.1108/AA-11-2015-094","issue":"2","ISSN":"0144-5154","creators":[{"firstName":"Baoye","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zidong","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Sheng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Genetic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Robotics","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:47:10Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:47:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/VYJCWY7H","itemID":537,"attachments":[{"key":"AMHY4N8W","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AA-11-2015-094/full/pdf?title=a-new-genetic-algorithm-approach-to-smooth-path-planning-for-mobile-robots","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:47:11Z","parentItem":"VYJCWY7H","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Song et al. - 2016 - A new genetic algorithm approach to smooth path pl.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:47:11Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:47:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/AMHY4N8W","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/AMHY4N8W/Song et al. - 2016 - A new genetic algorithm approach to smooth path pl.pdf","defaultPath":"files/538/Song et al. - 2016 - A new genetic algorithm approach to smooth path pl.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762537,"version":0},"$loki":1239},{"itemID":1467,"item":{"key":"W2GDXK5L","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Survivability: Measuring and ensuring path diversity","abstractNote":"A novel criterion is introduced for assessing the diversity of a collection of paths or trajectories. The main idea is the notion of survivability, which measures the likelihood that numerous paths are obstructed by the same obstacle. This helps to improve robustness with respect to collision, which is an important challenge in the design of real-time planning algorithms. Efficient algorithms are presented for computing the survivability criterion and for selecting a subset of paths that optimize survivability from a larger collection. The algorithms are implemented and solutions are illustrated for two different systems. Chi-square tests are used to show uniform coverage obtained by using the computed paths in a simple breadth-first search. Random obstacle placement is used to show superior robustness of these primitives compared to uniform sampling of the control space.","date":"2009-05","shortTitle":"Survivability","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"2068-2073","proceedingsTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","conferenceName":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152773","creators":[{"firstName":"Lawrence H.","lastName":"Erickson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Steven M.","lastName":"LaValle","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Robotics and automation","type":1},{"tag":"Robustness","type":1},{"tag":"Algorithm design and analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Robust control","type":1},{"tag":"Computer science","type":1},{"tag":"Testing","type":1},{"tag":"USA Councils","type":1},{"tag":"Remotely operated vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"Sampling methods","type":1},{"tag":"State-space methods","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:59:07Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:59:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/W2GDXK5L","itemID":1467,"attachments":[{"key":"S4MYW4R4","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5152773?arnumber=5152773","accessDate":"2022-10-06T06:59:19Z","parentItem":"W2GDXK5L","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"5152773.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:59:19Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:59:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/S4MYW4R4","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/S4MYW4R4/5152773.html","defaultPath":"files/1469/5152773.html"},{"key":"NH6FQHCX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152773&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NTE1Mjc3Mw==","accessDate":"2022-10-06T06:59:09Z","parentItem":"W2GDXK5L","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Erickson and LaValle - 2009 - Survivability Measuring and ensuring path diversi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-06T06:59:09Z","dateModified":"2022-10-06T06:59:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NH6FQHCX","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/NH6FQHCX/Erickson and LaValle - 2009 - Survivability Measuring and ensuring path diversi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1468/Erickson and LaValle - 2009 - Survivability Measuring and ensuring path diversi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762537,"version":0},"$loki":1240},{"itemID":93,"item":{"key":"W3XCWS4E","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Comparison of Parallel Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for Real-Time UAV Path Planning","abstractNote":"The development of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is of high interest to many governmental and military organizations around the world. An essential aspect of UAV autonomy is the ability for automatic path planning. In this paper, we use the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to cope with the complexity of the problem and compute feasible and quasi-optimal trajectories for fixed wing UAVs in a complex 3D environment, while considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle. The characteristics of the optimal path are represented in the form of a multiobjective cost function that we developed. The paths produced are composed of line segments, circular arcs and vertical helices. We reduce the execution time of our solutions by using the ‚Äúsingle-program, multiple-data‚Äù parallel programming paradigm and we achieve real-time performance on standard commercial off-the-shelf multicore CPUs. After achieving a quasi-linear speedup of 7.3 on 8 cores and an execution time of 10 s for both algorithms, we conclude that by using a parallel implementation on standard multicore CPUs, real-time path planning for UAVs is possible. Moreover, our rigorous comparison of the two algorithms shows, with statistical significance, that the GA produces superior trajectories to the PSO.","date":"2013-02","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","volume":"9","pages":"132-141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","DOI":"10.1109/TII.2012.2198665","issue":"1","ISSN":"1941-0050","creators":[{"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Roberge","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Tarbouchi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Labonte","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Cost function","type":1},{"tag":"Fuels","type":1},{"tag":"Genetic algorithm (GA)","type":1},{"tag":"Genetic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"parallel computing","type":1},{"tag":"particle swarm optimization (PSO)","type":1},{"tag":"Three dimensional displays","type":1},{"tag":"unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:19:33Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:19:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/W3XCWS4E","itemID":93,"attachments":[{"key":"RG9E3TAD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6198334?arnumber=6198334","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:19:53Z","parentItem":"W3XCWS4E","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"6198334.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:19:53Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:19:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/RG9E3TAD","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/RG9E3TAD/6198334.html","defaultPath":"files/95/6198334.html"},{"key":"PESJS4NG","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6198334&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NjE5ODMzNA==","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:19:38Z","parentItem":"W3XCWS4E","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Roberge et al. - 2013 - Comparison of Parallel Genetic Algorithm and Parti.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:19:38Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:19:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/PESJS4NG","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/PESJS4NG/Roberge et al. - 2013 - Comparison of Parallel Genetic Algorithm and Parti.pdf","defaultPath":"files/94/Roberge et al. - 2013 - Comparison of Parallel Genetic Algorithm and Parti.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762538,"version":0},"$loki":1241},{"itemID":1123,"item":{"key":"W4B7EY9Y","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Classic and Heuristic Approaches in Robot Motion Planning ‚Äì A Chronological Review","abstractNote":"Abstract‚ÄîThis paper reviews the major contributions to the Motion Planning (MP) field throughout a 35-year period, from classic approaches to heuristic algorithms.

To effectively monitor and collect data about a wildfire, UAS path planning is essential. Many of the applications adopt a centralized approach that uses a computer on the ground to provide path planning information for individual UASs. The applicability and robustness of such centralized approaches are limited due to the challenging wildfire environments. In addition, very few of the existing applications focus on the most actively spreading region of the fire which needs special monitoring attention. In this paper, we present an on-board path planning algorithm for UAS-based wildfire monitoring. The proposed algorithm uses real-time data collected by the UAS to direct the UAS to monitor the wildfire with special attention to the most active regions of the fire.

However, existing algorithms rely too much on randomness and often do not make use of known map information, this makes the growth of trees too blind. To this end, we introduce Bidirectional Homotopy-Guided RRT (BH-RRT) that combines Bidirectional RRT (Bi-RRT) with information obtained from obstacle contours. Compared with the previous methods, BH-RRT can reflect most of the map's information with a small number of feature points, and then form a set of points. This set can provide a better local goal point in each iteration, so that the tree can grow in a more favorable direction, rather than only being affected by the goal point. Experimental results show that BH-RRT outperforms RRT, HRRT and Bi-RRT in the success rate within a limited time.","date":"2020-12","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"333-338","proceedingsTitle":"2020 16th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)","conferenceName":"2020 16th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)","DOI":"10.1109/ICARCV50220.2020.9305400","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Xiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gui","lastName":"Ling","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Feiyang","lastName":"Suo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Mobile robots","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Service robots","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Electrical engineering","type":1},{"tag":"Bidirectional control","type":1},{"tag":"Research and development","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:44:03Z","dateModified":"2022-09-14T08:38:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/W64L2DDH","itemID":1170,"attachments":[{"key":"E9X6AYZH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9305400","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:44:42Z","parentItem":"W64L2DDH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9305400.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:44:42Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:44:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/E9X6AYZH","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/E9X6AYZH/9305400.html","defaultPath":"files/1173/9305400.html"},{"key":"P8D9J4I4","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9305400&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50LzkzMDU0MDA=","accessDate":"2022-08-11T08:44:05Z","parentItem":"W64L2DDH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lin et al. - 2020 - Bidirectional Homotopy-Guided RRT for Path Plannin.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T08:44:05Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T08:44:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/P8D9J4I4","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/P8D9J4I4/Lin et al. - 2020 - Bidirectional Homotopy-Guided RRT for Path Plannin.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1171/Lin et al. - 2020 - Bidirectional Homotopy-Guided RRT for Path Plannin.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762542,"version":0},"$loki":1246},{"itemID":119,"item":{"key":"WAVEI67S","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Robust Real-time UAV Replanning Using Guided Gradient-based Optimization and Topological Paths","abstractNote":"Gradient-based trajectory optimization (GTO) has gained wide popularity for quadrotor trajectory replanning. However, it suffers from local minima, which is not only fatal to safety but also unfavorable for smooth navigation. In this paper, we propose a replanning method based on GTO addressing this issue systematically. A path-guided optimization (PGO) approach is devised to tackle infeasible local minima, which improves the replanning success rate significantly. A topological path searching algorithm is developed to capture a collection of distinct useful paths in 3-D environments, each of which then guides an independent trajectory optimization. It activates a more comprehensive exploration of the solution space and output superior replanned trajectories. Benchmark evaluation shows that our method outplays state-of-the-art methods regarding replanning success rate and optimality. Challenging experiments of aggressive autonomous flight are presented to demonstrate the robustness of our method. We will release our implementation as an open-source package.","date":"2020-04-16","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12644","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:38:51Z","extra":"arXiv: 1912.12644","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1912.12644 [cs]","creators":[{"firstName":"Boyu","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Shen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:38:51Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:38:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WAVEI67S","itemID":119,"attachments":[{"key":"EPVTCX5Y","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12644.pdf","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:38:58Z","parentItem":"WAVEI67S","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou et al. - 2020 - Robust Real-time UAV Replanning Using Guided Gradi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:38:58Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:38:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EPVTCX5Y","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/EPVTCX5Y/Zhou et al. - 2020 - Robust Real-time UAV Replanning Using Guided Gradi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/121/Zhou et al. - 2020 - Robust Real-time UAV Replanning Using Guided Gradi.pdf"},{"key":"NKXVGEXL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12644","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:39:02Z","parentItem":"WAVEI67S","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1912.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:39:02Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:39:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NKXVGEXL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/NKXVGEXL/1912.html","defaultPath":"files/122/1912.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"4M74W66B","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"WAVEI67S","note":"Comment: Accepted by ICRA 2020. open source code: https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/TopoTraj","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:38:51Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:38:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/4M74W66B"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762543,"version":0},"$loki":1247},{"itemID":1228,"item":{"key":"WFZQ2JKK","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A Bug-based Path Planner Guided with Homotopy Classes:","date":"2012","language":"en","shortTitle":"A Bug-based Path Planner Guided with Homotopy Classes","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0004041201230131","accessDate":"2022-08-11T09:44:54Z","place":"Rome, Italy","publisher":"SciTePress - Science and and Technology Publications","ISBN":"978-989-8565-21-1 978-989-8565-22-8","pages":"123-131","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics","conferenceName":"9th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics","DOI":"10.5220/0004041201230131","creators":[],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T09:44:54Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T09:44:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WFZQ2JKK","itemID":1228,"attachments":[{"key":"L5GQ4MWE","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2012 - A Bug-based Path Planner Guided with Homotopy Clas.pdf","url":"https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2012/40412/40412.pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-11T09:44:52Z","parentItem":"WFZQ2JKK","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2012 - A Bug-based Path Planner Guided with Homotopy Clas.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T09:44:52Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T09:44:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/L5GQ4MWE","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/L5GQ4MWE/2012 - A Bug-based Path Planner Guided with Homotopy Clas.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1227/2012 - A Bug-based Path Planner Guided with Homotopy Clas.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762544,"version":0},"$loki":1248},{"itemID":961,"item":{"key":"WJTRHHI4","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Spatial Planning: A Configuration Space Approach","abstractNote":"This paper presents algorithms for computing constraints on the position of an object due to the presence of ther objects.

A local model-based approximate dynamic programming method is implemented to approximate the value function in a local neighborhood of the agent. By performing local approximations, prior knowledge of the locations of avoidance regions is not required. To alleviate the a priori knowledge of the number of avoidance regions in the operating domain, an extension is provided that modifies the value function approximation. The developed feedback-based motion planning strategy guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the approximated control policy to the optimal policy while also ensuring the agent remains outside avoidance regions. Simulations are included to demonstrate the preliminary development for a kinematic unicycle and generic nonlinear system. Results from three experiments are also presented to illustrate the performance of the developed method, where a quadcopter achieves approximate optimal regulation while avoiding three mobile obstacles. To demonstrate the developed method, known avoidance regions are used in the first experiment, unknown avoidance regions are used in the second experiment, and an unknown time-varying obstacle directed by a remote pilot is included in the third experiment.","date":"2020-04","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Robotics","volume":"36","pages":"414-430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","DOI":"10.1109/TRO.2019.2955321","issue":"2","ISSN":"1941-0468","creators":[{"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Deptula","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hsi-Yuan","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ryan A.","lastName":"Licitra","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joel A.","lastName":"Rosenfeld","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Warren E.","lastName":"Dixon","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Optimization","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"Optimal control","type":1},{"tag":"Data-based control","type":1},{"tag":"learning and adaptive systems","type":1},{"tag":"motion and path planning","type":1},{"tag":"neural and fuzzy control","type":1},{"tag":"optimization and optimal control","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T09:46:56Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T09:46:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WPQQNAW2","itemID":450,"attachments":[{"key":"W87BC5IZ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8930593?arnumber=8930593","accessDate":"2022-05-18T09:47:21Z","parentItem":"WPQQNAW2","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8930593.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T09:47:21Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T09:47:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/W87BC5IZ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/W87BC5IZ/8930593.html","defaultPath":"files/452/8930593.html"},{"key":"XKF9SF4G","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8930593&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9ODkzMDU5Mw==","accessDate":"2022-05-18T09:47:02Z","parentItem":"WPQQNAW2","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Deptula et al. - 2020 - Approximate Optimal Motion Planning to Avoid Unkno.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T09:47:02Z","dateModified":"2022-05-18T09:47:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XKF9SF4G","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XKF9SF4G/Deptula et al. - 2020 - Approximate Optimal Motion Planning to Avoid Unkno.pdf","defaultPath":"files/451/Deptula et al. - 2020 - Approximate Optimal Motion Planning to Avoid Unkno.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762546,"version":0},"$loki":1250},{"itemID":1298,"item":{"key":"WT4AY5FY","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Probabilistic roadmaps for path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces","abstractNote":"A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (/spl ap/150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds).","date":"1996-08","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","callNumber":"PRM","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","volume":"12","pages":"566-580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","DOI":"10.1109/70.508439","issue":"4","ISSN":"2374-958X","creators":[{"firstName":"L.E.","lastName":"Kavraki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Svestka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.-C.","lastName":"Latombe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.H.","lastName":"Overmars","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Motion planning","type":1},{"tag":"Orbital robotics","type":1},{"tag":"Computer science","type":1},{"tag":"Joining processes","type":1},{"tag":"Laboratories","type":1},{"tag":"Layout","type":1},{"tag":"Workstations","type":1}],"collections":["MKUGZUF7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T15:13:35Z","dateModified":"2022-09-08T14:13:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WT4AY5FY","itemID":1298,"attachments":[{"key":"WG588QX7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/508439","accessDate":"2022-08-23T15:13:38Z","parentItem":"WT4AY5FY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"508439.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T15:13:38Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T15:13:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WG588QX7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WG588QX7/508439.html","defaultPath":"files/1299/508439.html"},{"key":"6XECHT2Y","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=508439&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50LzUwODQzOQ==","accessDate":"2022-08-23T15:13:39Z","parentItem":"WT4AY5FY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kavraki et al. - 1996 - Probabilistic roadmaps for path planning in high-d.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-23T15:13:39Z","dateModified":"2022-08-23T15:13:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6XECHT2Y","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/6XECHT2Y/Kavraki et al. - 1996 - Probabilistic roadmaps for path planning in high-d.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1300/Kavraki et al. - 1996 - Probabilistic roadmaps for path planning in high-d.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762547,"version":0},"$loki":1251},{"itemID":1097,"item":{"key":"X3BN3G92","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Review on Path Planning Algorithms for Mobile Robots","abstractNote":"Mobile robots use is rising every day.

While recent CNN-based derainers have reported promising performances, deraining remains an open problem for two reasons. First, existing synthesized rain datasets have only limited realism, in terms of modeling real rain characteristics such as rain shape, direction and intensity. Second, there are no public benchmarks for quantitative comparisons on real rain images, which makes the current evaluation less objective. The core challenge is that real world rain/clean image pairs cannot be captured at the same time. In this paper, we address the single image rain removal problem in two ways. First, we propose a semi-automatic method that incorporates temporal priors and human supervision to generate a high-quality clean image from each input sequence of real rain images. Using this method, we construct a large-scale dataset of ‚àº29.5K rain/rain-free image pairs that covers a wide range of natural rain scenes. Second, to better cover the stochastic distribution of real rain streaks, we propose a novel SPatial Attentive Network (SPANet) to remove rain streaks in a local-to-global manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art deraining methods.","date":"6/2019","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953571/","accessDate":"2022-10-13T14:01:38Z","place":"Long Beach, CA, USA","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-72813-293-8","pages":"12262-12271","proceedingsTitle":"2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","conferenceName":"2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2019.01255","creators":[{"firstName":"Tianyu","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shaozhe","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rynson W.H.","lastName":"Lau","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-13T14:01:38Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T14:01:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/X4YIQNP3","itemID":1505,"attachments":[{"key":"82ZPC3AP","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wang et al. - 2019 - Spatial Attentive Single-Image Deraining With a Hi.pdf","url":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wang_Spatial_Attentive_Single-Image_Deraining_With_a_High_Quality_Real_Rain_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf","accessDate":"2022-10-13T14:01:36Z","parentItem":"X4YIQNP3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2019 - Spatial Attentive Single-Image Deraining With a Hi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-13T14:01:36Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T14:01:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/82ZPC3AP","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/82ZPC3AP/Wang et al. - 2019 - Spatial Attentive Single-Image Deraining With a Hi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1504/Wang et al. - 2019 - Spatial Attentive Single-Image Deraining With a Hi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762553,"version":0},"$loki":1254},{"itemID":535,"item":{"key":"XB5JB5PQ","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory planning by an integrated algorithm in a complex obstacle environment","abstractNote":"Both the artificial potential field method and direct method for the optimal control problem have shortcomings in terms of effectiveness and computational complexity for the trajectory-planning problem. This paper proposes an integrated algorithm combining the artificial potential field method and direct method for planning in a complex obstacle-rich environment. More realistic unmanned aerial vehicle dynamics equations, which are rarely applied in the traditional artificial potential field method, are considered in this paper. Furthermore, an additional control force is introduced to transcribe the artificial potential field model into an optimal control problem, and the equality/inequality constraints on the description of the shape of the obstacles are substituted by the repulsive force originating from all the obstacles. The Legendre pseudospectral method and virtual motion camouflage are both utilized to solve the modified optimal control problem for comparison purposes. The algorithm presented in this paper improves the performance of solving the trajectory-planning problem in an obstacle-rich environment. In particular, the algorithm is suitable for addressing some conditions that cannot be considered by the traditional artificial potential field method or direct method individually, such as local extreme value points and a large numbers of constraints. Two simulation examples, a single cube-shaped obstacle and a different-shaped obstacle-rich environment, are solved to demonstrate the capabilities and performance of the proposed algorithm.","date":"2017-09-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"SAGE Journals","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0954410016662058","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:44:45Z","extra":"Publisher: IMECHE","volume":"231","pages":"2048-2067","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering","DOI":"10.1177/0954410016662058","issue":"11","journalAbbreviation":"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering","ISSN":"0954-4100","creators":[{"firstName":"Siyu","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jianqiao","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuesong","lastName":"Mei","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Huadong","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yongbo","lastName":"Du","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"trajectory planning","type":1},{"tag":"Unmanned aerial vehicle","type":1},{"tag":"complex environment","type":1},{"tag":"integrated algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"obstacle-rich","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:44:45Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:44:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XB5JB5PQ","itemID":535,"attachments":[{"key":"UFTF9ZMK","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"SAGE PDF Full Text","url":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0954410016662058","accessDate":"2022-05-23T14:44:46Z","parentItem":"XB5JB5PQ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - Unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory planning by an .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-23T14:44:46Z","dateModified":"2022-05-23T14:44:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/UFTF9ZMK","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/UFTF9ZMK/Zhang et al. - 2017 - Unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory planning by an .pdf","defaultPath":"files/536/Zhang et al. - 2017 - Unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory planning by an .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762554,"version":0},"$loki":1255},{"itemID":1090,"item":{"key":"XBJMHIZT","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Any-Angle Path Planning","abstractNote":"In robotics and video games, one often discretizes continuous terrain into a grid with blocked and unblocked grid cells and then uses path-planning algorithms to find a shortest path on the resulting grid graph.

In this work, we propose a method to formulate trajectory generation as a quadratic program (QP) using the concept of a Safe Flight Corridor (SFC). The SFC is a collection of convex overlapping polyhedra that models free space and provides a connected path from the robot to the goal position. We derive an efficient convex decomposition method that builds the SFC from a piece-wise linear skeleton obtained using a fast graph search technique. The SFC provides a set of linear inequality constraints in the QP allowing real-time motion planning. Because the range and field of view of the robot's sensors are limited, we develop a framework of Receding Horizon Planning , which plans trajectories within a finite footprint in the local map, continuously updating the trajectory through a re-planning process. The re-planning process takes between 50 to 300 ms for a large and cluttered map. We show the feasibility of our approach, its completeness and performance, with applications to high-speed flight in both simulated and physical experiments using quadrotors.","date":"2017-07","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","volume":"2","pages":"1688-1695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LRA.2017.2663526","issue":"3","ISSN":"2377-3766","creators":[{"firstName":"Sikang","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Watterson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kartik","lastName":"Mohta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Camillo J.","lastName":"Taylor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Real-time systems","type":1},{"tag":"Navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"motion and path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Aerial robotics","type":1},{"tag":"üîñ"},{"tag":"autonomous vehicle navigation","type":1},{"tag":"Ellipsoids","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T10:15:23Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T10:15:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XCB8F6P6","itemID":744,"attachments":[{"key":"WTFDV287","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://undefined/document/7839930/?arnumber=7839930","accessDate":"2022-06-08T10:15:36Z","parentItem":"XCB8F6P6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7839930.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T10:15:36Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T10:15:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WTFDV287","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WTFDV287/7839930.html","defaultPath":"files/746/7839930.html"},{"key":"5E8GZS9G","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://undefined/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7839930&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzgzOTkzMA==","accessDate":"2022-06-08T10:15:26Z","parentItem":"XCB8F6P6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu et al. - 2017 - Planning Dynamically Feasible Trajectories for Qua.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T10:15:26Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T10:15:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/5E8GZS9G","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/5E8GZS9G/Liu et al. - 2017 - Planning Dynamically Feasible Trajectories for Qua.pdf","defaultPath":"files/745/Liu et al. - 2017 - Planning Dynamically Feasible Trajectories for Qua.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762555,"version":0},"$loki":1257},{"itemID":1219,"item":{"key":"XEQEZ89U","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Path Planning Algorithm for an AUV Guided with Homotopy Classes","abstractNote":"The paper proposes a method that uses topological information to guide path planning in any 2D workspace.

Our approach searches for smooth, minimum-time trajectories by exploring the map using a set of short-duration motion primitives. The primitives are generated by solving an optimal control problem and induce a finite lattice discretization on the state space which can be explored using a graph-search algorithm. The proposed approach is able to generate resolution-complete (i.e., optimal in the discretized space), safe, dynamically feasibility trajectories efficiently by exploiting the explicit solution of a Linear Quadratic Minimum Time problem. It does not assume a hovering initial condition and, hence, is suitable for fast online re-planning while the robot is moving. Quadrotor navigation with online re-planning is demonstrated using the proposed approach in simulation and physical experiments and comparisons with trajectory generation based on state-of-art quadratic programming are presented.","date":"2017-09","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 2153-0866","pages":"2872-2879","proceedingsTitle":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","conferenceName":"2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS.2017.8206119","creators":[{"firstName":"Sikang","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Atanasov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kartik","lastName":"Mohta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Aerospace electronics","type":1},{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Acceleration","type":1},{"tag":"Quadratic programming","type":1},{"tag":"Optimal control","type":1},{"tag":"üîñ"},{"tag":"Lattices","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:54:07Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:54:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XKHGGCD3","itemID":715,"attachments":[{"key":"LNU6Q7XD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://undefined/document/8206119/?arnumber=8206119","accessDate":"2022-06-08T09:54:19Z","parentItem":"XKHGGCD3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"8206119.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:54:19Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:54:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/LNU6Q7XD","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/LNU6Q7XD/8206119.html","defaultPath":"files/717/8206119.html"},{"key":"Q37TDEZP","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://undefined/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8206119&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9ODIwNjExOQ==","accessDate":"2022-06-08T09:54:12Z","parentItem":"XKHGGCD3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu et al. - 2017 - Search-based motion planning for quadrotors using .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:54:12Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T09:54:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Q37TDEZP","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/Q37TDEZP/Liu et al. - 2017 - Search-based motion planning for quadrotors using .pdf","defaultPath":"files/716/Liu et al. - 2017 - Search-based motion planning for quadrotors using .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762558,"version":0},"$loki":1259},{"itemID":1115,"item":{"key":"XMLTPJAE","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Review of Path Planning Algorithms for Unmanned Vehicles","abstractNote":"The knowledge of unmanned vehicles path planning algorithm is introduced.

Its efficiency however depends on the quality of heuristic function used. In fact, it has been shown that the correlation between the heuristic function and the true costto-goal significantly affects the efficiency of the search, when used with a large weight on the heuristics. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the problem of computing heuristics that explicitly aim to minimize the amount of search efforts in finding a feasible plan. The key observation we exploit is that while heuristics tries to guide the search along what looks like an optimal path towards the goal, there are other paths that are clearly sub-optimal yet are much easier to compute. For example, in motion planning domains like footstep-planning for humanoids, a heuristic that guides the search along a path away from obstacles is less likely to encounter local minima compared with the heuristics that guides the search along an optimal but close-to-obstacles path. We utilize this observation to define the concept of conservative heuristics and propose a simple algorithm for computing such a heuristic function. Experimental analysis on (1) humanoid footstep planning (simulation), (2) path planning for a UAV (simulation), and a real-world experiment in footstep-planning for a NAO robot shows the utility of the approach.","date":"2019","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ojs.aaai.org","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/3535","accessDate":"2022-06-24T13:25:15Z","rights":"Copyright (c) 2019 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","volume":"29","pages":"674-679","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling","ISSN":"2334-0843","creators":[{"firstName":"Ishani","lastName":"Chatterjee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Khadke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manuela","lastName":"Veloso","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T13:25:15Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T13:25:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XQU8K35P","itemID":862,"attachments":[{"key":"NLVJ8FJE","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/download/3535/3403","accessDate":"2022-06-24T13:25:17Z","parentItem":"XQU8K35P","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chatterjee et al. - 2019 - Speeding Up Search-Based Motion Planning via Conse.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T13:25:17Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T13:25:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/NLVJ8FJE","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/NLVJ8FJE/Chatterjee et al. - 2019 - Speeding Up Search-Based Motion Planning via Conse.pdf","defaultPath":"files/863/Chatterjee et al. - 2019 - Speeding Up Search-Based Motion Planning via Conse.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762560,"version":0},"$loki":1261},{"itemID":1133,"item":{"key":"XSBMR6PP","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A review on mobile robots motion path planning in unknown environments","abstractNote":"Robotics sector have achieved enormous founds in recent years due to its high demands in factories to carry out high-precision jobs like riveting and welding.

In this paper, a brief review on mobile robots motion path planning in unknown environment have been done based on recent founds. The paper categorizes motion path planning into two groups which is the Optimized Classic Approaches and Evolutionary and Hybrid Approaches. The optimized classic approaches represents the recent optimized motion path planning that implies the classic approaches such as A* search algorithm, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), D* and D* Lite algorithm.

While historically the problem has been addressed with filtering, advancements in visual estimation suggest that nonlinear optimization offers superior accuracy, while still tractable in complexity thanks to the sparsity of the underlying problem. Taking inspiration from these findings, we formulate a rigorously probabilistic cost function that combines reprojection errors of landmarks and inertial terms. The problem is kept tractable and thus ensuring real-time operation by limiting the optimization to a bounded window of keyframes through marginalization. Keyframes may be spaced in time by arbitrary intervals, while still related by linearized inertial terms. We present evaluation results on complementary datasets recorded with our custom-built stereo visual‚Äìinertial hardware that accurately synchronizes accelerometer and gyroscope measurements with imagery. A comparison of both a stereo and monocular version of our algorithm with and without online extrinsics estimation is shown with respect to ground truth. Furthermore, we compare the performance to an implementation of a state-of-the-art stochastic cloning sliding-window filter. This competitive reference implementation performs tightly coupled filtering-based visual‚Äìinertial odometry. While our approach declaredly demands more computation, we show its superior performance in terms of accuracy.","date":"2015-03-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"SAGE Journals","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0278364914554813","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:53:18Z","extra":"Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd STM","volume":"34","pages":"314-334","publicationTitle":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","DOI":"10.1177/0278364914554813","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","ISSN":"0278-3649","creators":[{"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Leutenegger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lynen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bosse","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Furgale","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)","type":1},{"tag":"robotics","type":1},{"tag":"sensor fusion","type":1},{"tag":"bundle adjustment","type":1},{"tag":"inertial measurement unit (IMU)","type":1},{"tag":"keyframes","type":1},{"tag":"stereo camera","type":1},{"tag":"Visual‚Äìinertial odometry","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:53:18Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:53:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XYSKZ6ZD","itemID":154,"attachments":[{"key":"KMPNGLRJ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Submitted Version","url":"https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/23413/2/ijrr2014_revision_1.pdf","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:53:21Z","parentItem":"XYSKZ6ZD","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Leutenegger et al. - 2015 - Keyframe-based visual‚Äìinertial odometry using nonl.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:53:21Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:53:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/KMPNGLRJ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/KMPNGLRJ/Leutenegger et al. - 2015 - Keyframe-based visual‚Äìinertial odometry using nonl.pdf","defaultPath":"files/155/Leutenegger et al. - 2015 - Keyframe-based visual‚Äìinertial odometry using nonl.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762565,"version":0},"$loki":1265},{"itemID":951,"item":{"key":"Y4G2227H","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"An introduction to optimization","abstractNote":"\"The purpose of the book is to give the reader a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods\"--","date":"2012","libraryCatalog":"Library of Congress ISBN","callNumber":"QA402.5","place":"Hoboken, New Jersey","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc","ISBN":"978-1-118-51515-0 978-1-118-51509-9","edition":"Fourth edition","numPages":"1","creators":[{"firstName":"Edwin Kah Pin","lastName":"Chong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stanislaw H.","lastName":"≈ªak","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mathematical optimization","type":1},{"tag":"MATHEMATICS / Discrete Mathematics","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-08T10:24:31Z","dateModified":"2022-07-08T10:24:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Y4G2227H","itemID":951,"attachments":[{"key":"LGVIJ9MS","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Chong and ≈ªak - 2012 - An introduction to optimization.pdf","parentItem":"Y4G2227H","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chong and ≈ªak - 2012 - An introduction to optimization.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-08T10:25:15Z","dateModified":"2022-07-08T10:25:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/LGVIJ9MS","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/LGVIJ9MS/Chong and ≈ªak - 2012 - An introduction to optimization.pdf","defaultPath":"files/952/Chong and ≈ªak - 2012 - An introduction to optimization.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762567,"version":0},"$loki":1266},{"itemID":1347,"item":{"key":"Y6Z3LXE5","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"EB-RRT: Optimal Motion Planning for Mobile Robots","abstractNote":"In a human-robot coexisting environment, it is pivotal for a mobile service robot to arrive at the goal position safely and efficiently. In this article, an elastic band-based rapidly exploring random tree (EB-RRT) algorithm is proposed to achieve real-time optimal motion planning for the mobile robot in the dynamic environment, which can maintain a homotopy optimal trajectory based on current heuristic trajectory. Inspired by the EB method, we propose a hierarchical framework consisting of two planners. In the global planner, a time-based RRT algorithm is used to generate a feasible heuristic trajectory for a specific task in the dynamic environment. However, this heuristic trajectory is nonoptimal. In the dynamic replanner, the time-based nodes on the heuristic trajectory are updated due to the internal contraction force and the repulsive force from the obstacles. In this way, the heuristic trajectory is optimized continuously, and the final trajectory can be proved to be optimal in the homotopy class of the heuristic trajectory. Simulation experiments reveal that compared with two stateof-the-art algorithms, our proposed method can achieve better performance in dynamic environments.","date":"2020-10","shortTitle":"EB-RRT","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","volume":"17","pages":"2063-2073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TASE.2020.2987397","issue":"4","ISSN":"1558-3783","creators":[{"firstName":"Jiankun","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Max Q.-H.","lastName":"Meng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oussama","lastName":"Khatib","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Real-time systems","type":1},{"tag":"Mobile robots","type":1},{"tag":"Algorithm design and analysis","type":1},{"tag":"mobile robots","type":1},{"tag":"Motion planning","type":1},{"tag":"optimal motion planning","type":1},{"tag":"Elastic band (EB)","type":1},{"tag":"sampling-based motion planning","type":1}],"collections":["MKUGZUF7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-08T15:21:27Z","dateModified":"2022-09-08T15:21:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Y6Z3LXE5","itemID":1347,"attachments":[{"key":"YSQD4UCP","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9082624","accessDate":"2022-09-08T15:22:00Z","parentItem":"Y6Z3LXE5","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9082624.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-08T15:22:00Z","dateModified":"2022-09-08T15:22:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YSQD4UCP","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/YSQD4UCP/9082624.html","defaultPath":"files/1349/9082624.html"},{"key":"P79LP9VM","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9082624&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50LzkwODI2MjQ=","accessDate":"2022-09-08T15:21:32Z","parentItem":"Y6Z3LXE5","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2020 - EB-RRT Optimal Motion Planning for Mobile Robots.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-08T15:21:32Z","dateModified":"2022-09-08T15:21:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/P79LP9VM","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/P79LP9VM/Wang et al. - 2020 - EB-RRT Optimal Motion Planning for Mobile Robots.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1348/Wang et al. - 2020 - EB-RRT Optimal Motion Planning for Mobile Robots.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762567,"version":0},"$loki":1267},{"itemID":1250,"item":{"key":"Y79PN3NS","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A Topology-Based Path Similarity Metric and its Application to Sampling-Based Motion Planning","abstractNote":"Many applications of robotic motion planning benefit from considering multiple homotopically distinct paths rather than a single path from start to goal.

We propose metrics for efficiently approximating the homotopic similarity of two paths are, instead of verifying homotopy equivalence directly. We propose two metrics: (1) a naive application of local planning, a common subroutine of sampling-based motion planning, and (2) a novel approach that reasons about the topologically distinct portions of the workspace that a path visits. We present three applications of our metric to demonstrate its use and effectiveness: extracting topologically distinct paths from an existing roadmap, comparing paths for robot manipulators, and improving the computational efficiency of an existing sampling-based method, Path Deformation Roadmaps (PDRs), by over two orders of magnitude.

We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain $X$ to a target domain $Y$ in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping $G: X \\rightarrow Y$ such that the distribution of images from $G(X)$ is indistinguishable from the distribution $Y$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping $F: Y \\rightarrow X$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push $F(G(X)) \\approx X$ (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.","date":"2020-08-24","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593","accessDate":"2022-05-02T16:01:26Z","extra":"arXiv: 1703.10593","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1703.10593 [cs]","creators":[{"firstName":"Jun-Yan","lastName":"Zhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Taesung","lastName":"Park","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Phillip","lastName":"Isola","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexei A.","lastName":"Efros","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T16:01:26Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T13:49:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Y88PN6IK","itemID":397,"attachments":[{"key":"6HRYBPHK","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf","accessDate":"2022-05-02T16:02:25Z","parentItem":"Y88PN6IK","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhu et al. - 2020 - Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Co.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T16:02:25Z","dateModified":"2022-05-02T16:02:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6HRYBPHK","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/6HRYBPHK/Zhu et al. - 2020 - Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Co.pdf","defaultPath":"files/399/Zhu et al. - 2020 - Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Co.pdf"},{"key":"3B5ZUC6H","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593","accessDate":"2022-05-02T16:02:30Z","parentItem":"Y88PN6IK","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1703.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T16:02:30Z","dateModified":"2022-05-02T16:02:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/3B5ZUC6H","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/3B5ZUC6H/1703.html","defaultPath":"files/400/1703.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"Z65S3R9J","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"Y88PN6IK","note":"Comment: An extended version of our ICCV 2017 paper, v7 fixed the typos and updated the implementation details.

The problem of exploring/finding the different homotopy classes in an environment and the problem of finding least-cost paths restricted to a specific homotopy class (or not belonging to certain homotopy classes) arises frequently in such applications as predicting paths for unpredictable entities and deployment of multiple agents for efficient exploration of an environment. In [Bhattacharya, Kumar, Likhachev, AAAI 2010] we have shown how homotopy classes of trajectories on a two-dimensional plane with obstacles can be classified and identified using the Cauchy Integral Theorem and the Residue Theorem from Complex Analysis. In more recent work [Bhattacharya, Likhachev, Kumar, RSS 2011] we extended this representation to three-dimensional spaces by exploiting certain laws from the Theory of Electromagnetism (Biot-Savart law and Ampere's Law) for representing and identifying homotopy classes in three dimensions in an efficient way. Using such a representation, we showed that homotopy class constraints can be seamlessly weaved into graph search techniques for determining optimal path constrained to certain homotopy classes or forbidden from others, as well as for exploring different homotopy classes in an environment.

This problem is motivated by the use of boats with booms in skimming operations for cleaning oil spills or removing debris on the surface of the water. The goal in this paper is to automate the task of separating the objects of interest from a collection of objects by manipulating them with cables that are actuated only at the ends, and then transporting them to specified destinations. Because the cable is flexible, the shape of the cable must be explicitly modeled in the problem. Further, the robots must cooperatively plan motions to achieve the required cable shape and gross position/orientation to separate the objects of interest and then transport them as specified. The theoretical foundation for the problem is derived from topological invariants, homology and homotopy. We first derive the necessary topological conditions for achieving the desired separation of objects. We then propose a distributed search-based planning technique for finding optimal robot trajectories for separation and transportation. We demonstrate the applicability of this method using a dynamic simulation platform with explicit models of the cable dynamics, the contact between the cable and one or more objects, and the surface drag on the cable and on the objects. We also demonstrate the working of the proposed algorithm on an experimental platform consisting of a system of two cooperating autonomous surface vessels and stationary/anchored objects.","date":"05/2015","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364914562236","accessDate":"2022-08-26T11:48:25Z","volume":"34","pages":"799-815","publicationTitle":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","DOI":"10.1177/0278364914562236","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","ISSN":"0278-3649, 1741-3176","creators":[{"firstName":"Subhrajit","lastName":"Bhattacharya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Soonkyum","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hordur","lastName":"Heidarsson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gaurav S.","lastName":"Sukhatme","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-26T11:48:25Z","dateModified":"2022-08-26T11:48:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YAVLMNKJ","itemID":1325,"attachments":[{"key":"HNFJ4RB8","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bhattacharya et al. - 2015 - A topological approach to using cables to separate.pdf","url":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.903.2061&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2022-08-26T11:48:23Z","parentItem":"YAVLMNKJ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bhattacharya et al. - 2015 - A topological approach to using cables to separate.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-26T11:48:23Z","dateModified":"2022-08-26T11:48:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/HNFJ4RB8","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/HNFJ4RB8/Bhattacharya et al. - 2015 - A topological approach to using cables to separate.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1324/Bhattacharya et al. - 2015 - A topological approach to using cables to separate.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762572,"version":0},"$loki":1273},{"itemID":1322,"item":{"key":"YBDWT8N3","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Exploration of unknown environments with a tethered mobile robot","abstractNote":"This paper presents a tangle-free frontier based exploration algorithm for planar mobile robots equipped with limited length and anchored tethers. After planning a path to the closest point in the frontier between free and unknown space, the robot computes an estimate of the future length of its tether and decides, by comparing the anticipated length with the minimum possible tether length, whether the path should be followed or not. If the anticipated tether is longer than the minimum tether by a function of the expected radius of the obstacles, a path planner with homotopic constraints is used to plan a path that brings the robot tether to the same homotopy class of the shortest tether. This behavior will not only limit the tether length but also will prevent tether entangling on the obstacles of the environment.

However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms have been established so far. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT$^*$ algorithm, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.

A lot of research has been devoted to improve object detection algorithms in order to provide highly accurate detection results in real time. However, these algorithms show a strong drop in performance as soon as they are exposed to adverse weather. Poor weather conditions such as rain, fog or snow lead to a reduction in visibility and thus objects are more difficult to recognize or not visible at all. This leads to a high degree of uncertainty for an automotive camera system. To enable automated driving, camera systems must be able to cope with adverse weather and the associated high uncertainty. Including more weather image data when training the algorithms can improve object detection in bad visibility conditions. However, weather image data is difficult to collect in reality and thus only available to a limited extent. In this work, we evaluate the possibility of using Generative Adversarial Networks to create synthetic weather image data. For this purpose, we compare the generated images of different network architectures trained on a diverse weather dataset collected from Flickr. The resulting data is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to its realism and suggests that our approach is capable of generating realistic weather images.","date":"2021-09","shortTitle":"Let it Snow","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"3300-3306","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","DOI":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565008","creators":[{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Rothmeier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Huber","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Uncertainty","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Cameras","type":1},{"tag":"Training","type":1},{"tag":"Network architecture","type":1},{"tag":"Object detection","type":1},{"tag":"Rain","type":1},{"tag":"Snow","type":1},{"tag":"üîñ"}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T10:53:59Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T13:49:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YI6S5ECF","itemID":303,"attachments":[{"key":"GPUH5JT6","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565008/?arnumber=9565008","accessDate":"2022-04-25T10:54:09Z","parentItem":"YI6S5ECF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9565008.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T10:54:09Z","dateModified":"2022-04-25T10:54:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/GPUH5JT6","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/GPUH5JT6/9565008.html","defaultPath":"files/305/9565008.html"},{"key":"8KYDI7G8","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565008&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTU2NTAwOA==","accessDate":"2022-04-25T10:54:03Z","parentItem":"YI6S5ECF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Rothmeier and Huber - 2021 - Let it Snow On the Synthesis of Adverse Weather I.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-25T10:54:03Z","dateModified":"2022-04-25T10:54:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8KYDI7G8","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8KYDI7G8/Rothmeier and Huber - 2021 - Let it Snow On the Synthesis of Adverse Weather I.pdf","defaultPath":"files/304/Rothmeier and Huber - 2021 - Let it Snow On the Synthesis of Adverse Weather I.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762576,"version":0},"$loki":1277},{"itemID":357,"item":{"key":"YMVGUF8T","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"Lectures on Robotic Planning and Kinematics","date":"2022","creators":[{"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Bullo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephen L.","lastName":"Smith","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-28T09:28:07Z","dateModified":"2022-04-28T09:30:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YMVGUF8T","itemID":357,"attachments":[{"key":"8PL6FTSZ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bullo and Smith - 2022 - Lectures on Robotic Planning and Kinematics.pdf","parentItem":"YMVGUF8T","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bullo and Smith - 2022 - Lectures on Robotic Planning and Kinematics.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-28T09:30:17Z","dateModified":"2022-04-28T09:30:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8PL6FTSZ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8PL6FTSZ/Bullo and Smith - 2022 - Lectures on Robotic Planning and Kinematics.pdf","defaultPath":"files/358/Bullo and Smith - 2022 - Lectures on Robotic Planning and Kinematics.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762576,"version":0},"$loki":1278},{"itemID":966,"item":{"key":"YP5NUUQ6","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"SIPP: Safe interval path planning for dynamic environments","abstractNote":"Robotic path planning in static environments is a thoroughly studied problem that can typically be solved very efficiently. However, planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is still computationally challenging because it requires adding time as an additional dimension to the search-space explored by the planner. In order to avoid the increase in the dimensionality of the planning problem, most real-time approaches to path planning treat dynamic obstacles as static and constantly re-plan as dynamic obstacles move. Although gaining efficiency, these approaches sacrifice optimality and even completeness. In this paper, we develop a planner that builds on the observation that while the number of safe timesteps in any configuration may be unbounded, the number of safe time intervals in a configuration is finite and generally very small. A safe interval is a time period for a configuration with no collisions and if it were extended one timestep in either direction, it would then be in collision. The planner exploits this observation and constructs a search-space with states defined by their configuration and safe interval, resulting in a graph that generally only has a few states per configuration. On the theoretical side, we show that our planner can provide the same optimality and completeness guarantees as planning with time as an additional dimension. On the experimental side, in simulation tests with up to 200 dynamic obstacles, we show that our planner is significantly faster, making it feasible to use in real-time on robots operating in large dynamic environments. We also ran several real robot trials on the PR2, a mobile manipulation platform.","date":"2011-05","shortTitle":"SIPP","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"ISSN: 1050-4729","pages":"5628-5635","proceedingsTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","conferenceName":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980306","creators":[{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Phillips","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Likhachev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Trajectory","type":1},{"tag":"Heuristic algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Collision avoidance","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Vehicle dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"Real time systems","type":1}],"collections":["KP5FEXJ5"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/FR7TKUJM"]},"dateAdded":"2022-07-12T14:08:33Z","dateModified":"2022-07-14T10:43:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YP5NUUQ6","itemID":966,"attachments":[{"key":"SL259JT4","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5980306?arnumber=5980306","accessDate":"2022-07-12T14:08:43Z","parentItem":"YP5NUUQ6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"5980306.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-12T14:08:43Z","dateModified":"2022-07-12T14:08:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SL259JT4","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SL259JT4/5980306.html","defaultPath":"files/968/5980306.html"},{"key":"M6TIYYZJ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980306&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NTk4MDMwNg==","accessDate":"2022-07-12T14:08:35Z","parentItem":"YP5NUUQ6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Phillips and Likhachev - 2011 - SIPP Safe interval path planning for dynamic envi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-12T14:08:35Z","dateModified":"2022-07-12T14:08:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/M6TIYYZJ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/M6TIYYZJ/Phillips and Likhachev - 2011 - SIPP Safe interval path planning for dynamic envi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/967/Phillips and Likhachev - 2011 - SIPP Safe interval path planning for dynamic envi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762577,"version":0},"$loki":1279},{"itemID":69,"item":{"key":"YQ7FFXRN","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"RAPTOR: Robust and Perception-aware Trajectory Replanning for Quadrotor Fast Flight","abstractNote":"Recent advances in trajectory replanning have enabled quadrotor to navigate autonomously in unknown environments. However, high-speed navigation still remains a significant challenge. Given very limited time, existing methods have no strong guarantee on the feasibility or quality of the solutions. Moreover, most methods do not consider environment perception, which is the key bottleneck to fast flight. In this paper, we present RAPTOR, a robust and perception-aware replanning framework to support fast and safe flight. A path-guided optimization (PGO) approach that incorporates multiple topological paths is devised, to ensure finding feasible and high-quality trajectories in very limited time. We also introduce a perception-aware planning strategy to actively observe and avoid unknown obstacles. A risk-aware trajectory refinement ensures that unknown obstacles which may endanger the quadrotor can be observed earlier and avoid in time. The motion of yaw angle is planned to actively explore the surrounding space that is relevant for safe navigation. The proposed methods are tested extensively. We will release our implementation as an open-source package for the community.","date":"2020-07-06","shortTitle":"RAPTOR","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03465","accessDate":"2022-04-19T15:26:43Z","extra":"arXiv: 2007.03465","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2007.03465 [cs]","creators":[{"firstName":"Boyu","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Shen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Robotics","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:26:43Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:26:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YQ7FFXRN","itemID":69,"attachments":[{"key":"UV2LYIWV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03465.pdf","accessDate":"2022-04-19T15:26:53Z","parentItem":"YQ7FFXRN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou et al. - 2020 - RAPTOR Robust and Perception-aware Trajectory Rep.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:26:53Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:26:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/UV2LYIWV","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/UV2LYIWV/Zhou et al. - 2020 - RAPTOR Robust and Perception-aware Trajectory Rep.pdf","defaultPath":"files/71/Zhou et al. - 2020 - RAPTOR Robust and Perception-aware Trajectory Rep.pdf"},{"key":"WHGZAL54","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03465","accessDate":"2022-04-19T15:26:58Z","parentItem":"YQ7FFXRN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2007.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:26:58Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:26:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WHGZAL54","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WHGZAL54/2007.html","defaultPath":"files/72/2007.html"}],"notes":[{"key":"JXLJNEGG","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"YQ7FFXRN","note":"Comment: Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvR8Lq2pmPg | Code: https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1912.12644","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:26:43Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:26:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/JXLJNEGG"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762578,"version":0},"$loki":1280},{"itemID":912,"item":{"key":"YQJ4Q55X","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Euclidean Pathfinding with Compressed Path Databases","abstractNote":"We consider optimal and anytime algorithms for the Euclidean Shortest Path Problem (ESPP) in two dimensions.

Many path planning algorithms generate a path which has many sharp or angular turns. Such paths are not fit for mobile robot as it has to slow down at these sharp turns. These robots could be carrying delicate, dangerous, or precious items and executing these sharp turns may not be feasible kinematically. On the contrary, smooth trajectories are often desired for robot motion and must be generated while considering the static and dynamic obstacles and other constraints like feasible curvature, robot and lane dimensions, and speed. The aim of this paper is to succinctly summarize and review the path smoothing techniques in robot navigation and discuss the challenges and future trends. Both autonomous mobile robots and autonomous vehicles (outdoor robots or self-driving cars) are discussed. The state-of-the-art algorithms are broadly classified into different categories and each approach is introduced briefly with necessary background, merits, and drawbacks. Finally, the paper discusses the current and future challenges in optimal trajectory generation and smoothing research.","date":"2018/9","language":"en","shortTitle":"Path Smoothing Techniques in Robot Navigation","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/9/3170","accessDate":"2022-08-08T15:24:50Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 9\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"18","pages":"3170","publicationTitle":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s18093170","issue":"9","ISSN":"1424-8220","creators":[{"firstName":"Abhijeet","lastName":"Ravankar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ankit A.","lastName":"Ravankar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yukinori","lastName":"Kobayashi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Hoshino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chao-Chung","lastName":"Peng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"path planning","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"autonomous vehicle motion planning","type":1},{"tag":"robot navigation","type":1},{"tag":"robot trajectory smoothing","type":1}],"collections":["XEGDLIT3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-08T15:24:50Z","dateModified":"2022-08-09T10:39:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YRYU4HGJ","itemID":1061,"attachments":[{"key":"YEYQEWGY","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/9/3170/pdf?version=1537415689","accessDate":"2022-08-08T15:24:51Z","parentItem":"YRYU4HGJ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ravankar et al. - 2018 - Path Smoothing Techniques in Robot Navigation Sta.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-08T15:24:51Z","dateModified":"2022-08-08T15:24:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YEYQEWGY","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/YEYQEWGY/Ravankar et al. - 2018 - Path Smoothing Techniques in Robot Navigation Sta.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1062/Ravankar et al. - 2018 - Path Smoothing Techniques in Robot Navigation Sta.pdf"},{"key":"ISEANVBS","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/9/3170","accessDate":"2022-08-08T15:24:56Z","parentItem":"YRYU4HGJ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"3170.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-08T15:24:56Z","dateModified":"2022-08-08T15:24:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ISEANVBS","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/ISEANVBS/3170.html","defaultPath":"files/1063/3170.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762580,"version":0},"$loki":1282},{"itemID":394,"item":{"key":"YWKVT5NB","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Seeing in the Dark by Component-GAN","abstractNote":"Recently, Retinex theory based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) algorithms have achieved impressive results in controlled environment. However, the majority of deep learning based LLIE algorithms leverage relighting by enhancing the illumination components that directly determines the image brightness, regretfully, they ignore the information of reflectance components, which may cause problems such as image noise and color distortion in reconstructed images. To tackle this problem, in this letter, we propose a component enhancement network based on Generative Adversarial Network (Component-GAN) for recovering clear images from low-light ones. Specifically, the network is composed of the decomposition part for dividing the paired low/normal-light images into illumination components and reflectance components, and the enhancement part for generating high-quality images. It is worth to note that we provide two branches of component enhancement network, which are parallel to improve the two components simultaneously. Hereby, we treat the reconstruction part as the generative network and adopt discriminative network to boost image reconstruction performance. Through extensive experiments, the proposed approach outperforms some state-of-the-art LLIE methods in terms of visual and subjective qualities.","date":"2021","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Signal Processing Letters","volume":"28","pages":"1250-1254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3079848","ISSN":"1558-2361","creators":[{"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Rao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Lu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yanduo","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhongyuan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Visualization","type":1},{"tag":"Generators","type":1},{"tag":"Lighting","type":1},{"tag":"Image reconstruction","type":1},{"tag":"Generative adversarial networks","type":1},{"tag":"Image color analysis","type":1},{"tag":"generative adversarial network","type":1},{"tag":"Noise reduction","type":1},{"tag":"Component enhancement network","type":1},{"tag":"light enhancement","type":1},{"tag":"low-light image","type":1}],"collections":["TEZTF7NU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T15:52:20Z","dateModified":"2022-10-13T13:49:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YWKVT5NB","itemID":394,"attachments":[{"key":"SRRQXUAL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9429924/?arnumber=9429924","accessDate":"2022-05-02T15:52:34Z","parentItem":"YWKVT5NB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9429924.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T15:52:34Z","dateModified":"2022-05-02T15:52:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/SRRQXUAL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/SRRQXUAL/9429924.html","defaultPath":"files/396/9429924.html"},{"key":"IXZNMDG7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9429924&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTQyOTkyNA==","accessDate":"2022-05-02T15:52:25Z","parentItem":"YWKVT5NB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Rao et al. - 2021 - Seeing in the Dark by Component-GAN.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-02T15:52:25Z","dateModified":"2022-05-02T15:52:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/IXZNMDG7","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/IXZNMDG7/Rao et al. - 2021 - Seeing in the Dark by Component-GAN.pdf","defaultPath":"files/395/Rao et al. - 2021 - Seeing in the Dark by Component-GAN.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762580,"version":0},"$loki":1283},{"itemID":79,"item":{"key":"Z22G28T8","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Drone Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Review","abstractNote":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in many challenging and diversified applications. These applications belong to the civilian and the military fields. To name a few; infrastructure inspection, traffic patrolling, remote sensing, mapping, surveillance, rescuing humans and animals, environment monitoring, and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) operations. However, the use of UAVs in these applications needs a substantial level of autonomy. In other words, UAVs should have the ability to accomplish planned missions in unexpected situations without requiring human intervention. To ensure this level of autonomy, many artificial intelligence algorithms were designed. These algorithms targeted the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of UAVs. In this paper, we described the state of the art of one subset of these algorithms: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. We made a detailed description of them, and we deduced the current limitations in this area. We noted that most of these DRL methods were designed to ensure stable and smooth UAV navigation by training computer-simulated environments. We realized that further research efforts are needed to address the challenges that restrain their deployment in real-life scenarios.","date":"2021/1","language":"en","shortTitle":"Drone Deep Reinforcement Learning","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/9/999","accessDate":"2022-04-19T15:33:47Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 9\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"10","pages":"999","publicationTitle":"Electronics","DOI":"10.3390/electronics10090999","issue":"9","ISSN":"2079-9292","creators":[{"firstName":"Ahmad Taher","lastName":"Azar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anis","lastName":"Koubaa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nada","lastName":"Ali Mohamed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Habiba A.","lastName":"Ibrahim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zahra Fathy","lastName":"Ibrahim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Kazim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Ammar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bilel","lastName":"Benjdira","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alaa M.","lastName":"Khamis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ibrahim A.","lastName":"Hameed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Casalino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"unmanned aerial vehicles","type":1},{"tag":"navigation","type":1},{"tag":"UAVs","type":1},{"tag":"control","type":1},{"tag":"deep reinforcement learning (DRL)","type":1},{"tag":"guidance","type":1},{"tag":"literature review","type":1},{"tag":"machine learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:33:47Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:33:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Z22G28T8","itemID":79,"attachments":[{"key":"9U46R9BT","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/9/999/pdf?version=1619079649","accessDate":"2022-04-19T15:33:48Z","parentItem":"Z22G28T8","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Azar et al. - 2021 - Drone Deep Reinforcement Learning A Review.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:33:48Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:33:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/9U46R9BT","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/9U46R9BT/Azar et al. - 2021 - Drone Deep Reinforcement Learning A Review.pdf","defaultPath":"files/80/Azar et al. - 2021 - Drone Deep Reinforcement Learning A Review.pdf"},{"key":"YH7ITUCV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/9/999","accessDate":"2022-04-19T15:33:53Z","parentItem":"Z22G28T8","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"999.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-19T15:33:53Z","dateModified":"2022-04-19T15:33:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/YH7ITUCV","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/YH7ITUCV/999.html","defaultPath":"files/81/999.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762582,"version":0},"$loki":1284},{"itemID":144,"item":{"key":"Z2D8J6YL","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Multi-Sensor Fusion MAV State Estimation from Long-Range Stereo, IMU, GPS and Barometric Sensors","abstractNote":"State estimation is the most critical capability for MAV (Micro-Aerial Vehicle) localization, autonomous obstacle avoidance, robust flight control and 3D environmental mapping. There are three main challenges for MAV state estimation: (1) it can deal with aggressive 6 DOF (Degree Of Freedom) motion; (2) it should be robust to intermittent GPS (Global Positioning System) (even GPS-denied) situations; (3) it should work well both for low- and high-altitude flight. In this paper, we present a state estimation technique by fusing long-range stereo visual odometry, GPS, barometric and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurements. The new estimation system has two main parts, a stochastic cloning EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) estimator that loosely fuses both absolute state measurements (GPS, barometer) and the relative state measurements (IMU, visual odometry), and is derived and discussed in detail. A long-range stereo visual odometry is proposed for high-altitude MAV odometry calculation by using both multi-view stereo triangulation and a multi-view stereo inverse depth filter. The odometry takes the EKF information (IMU integral) for robust camera pose tracking and image feature matching, and the stereo odometry output serves as the relative measurements for the update of the state estimation. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset and our real flight dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation system, especially for the aggressive, intermittent GPS and high-altitude MAV flight.","date":"2017/1","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/1/11","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:48:48Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 1\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"17","pages":"11","publicationTitle":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s17010011","issue":"1","ISSN":"1424-8220","creators":[{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Nuske","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Scherer","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"absolute and relative state measurements","type":1},{"tag":"GPS-denied state estimation","type":1},{"tag":"long-range stereo visual odometry","type":1},{"tag":"multi-sensor fusion","type":1},{"tag":"stochastic cloning EKF","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:48:48Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:48:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/Z2D8J6YL","itemID":144,"attachments":[{"key":"EIWCH2PT","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/1/11/pdf?version=1482407839","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:48:49Z","parentItem":"Z2D8J6YL","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Song et al. - 2017 - A Multi-Sensor Fusion MAV State Estimation from Lo.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:48:49Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:48:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/EIWCH2PT","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/EIWCH2PT/Song et al. - 2017 - A Multi-Sensor Fusion MAV State Estimation from Lo.pdf","defaultPath":"files/145/Song et al. - 2017 - A Multi-Sensor Fusion MAV State Estimation from Lo.pdf"},{"key":"8HHGY65C","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/1/11/htm","accessDate":"2022-04-20T11:53:00Z","parentItem":"Z2D8J6YL","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"htm.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-20T11:53:00Z","dateModified":"2022-04-20T11:53:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/8HHGY65C","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/8HHGY65C/htm.html","defaultPath":"files/151/htm.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762583,"version":0},"$loki":1285},{"itemID":893,"item":{"key":"ZBCSN5TI","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"On the Optimal Efficiency of A* with Dominance Pruning","abstractNote":"A well known result is that, given a consistent heuristic and no other source of information, A‚àó does expand a minimal number of nodes up to tie-breaking.

We present a conservative trajectory-optimization-based local planner, coupled with a local exploration strategy that selects intermediate goals. We perform extensive simulations to show that this system performs better than the standard approach of using an optimistic global planner and also outperforms doing a single exploration step when the local planner is stuck.

However, it suffers from local minima, which is not only fatal to safety but also unfavorable for smooth navigation. In this paper, we propose a replanning method based on GTO addressing this issue systematically. A path-guided optimization (PGO) approach is devised to tackle infeasible local minima, which improves the replanning success rate significantly. A topological path searching algorithm is developed to capture a collection of distinct useful paths in 3-D environments, each of which then guides an independent trajectory optimization. It activates a more comprehensive exploration of the solution space and output superior replanned trajectories.

Those minima are important to visualize to let a user guide, prevent or predict motions. Towards this goal, we develop the motion planning explorer, an algorithm to let users interactively explore a tree of local-minima. Following ideas from Morse theory, we define local minima as paths invariant under minimization of a cost functional. The local-minima are grouped into a local-minima tree using lower-dimensional projections specified by a user. The user can then interactively explore the local-minima tree, thereby visualizing the problem structure and guide or prevent motions. We show the motion planning explorer to faithfully capture local minima in four realistic scenarios, both for holonomic and certain non-holonomic robots.","date":"2020-04","shortTitle":"Motion Planning Explorer","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","volume":"5","pages":"346-353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LRA.2019.2958524","issue":"2","ISSN":"2377-3766","creators":[{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Orthey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Fr√©sz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Toussaint","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Visualization","type":1},{"tag":"Robots","type":1},{"tag":"üëÅÔ∏è"},{"tag":"Prediction algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Data analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Data visualization","type":1},{"tag":"Foundations of Automation","type":1},{"tag":"Minimization","type":1},{"tag":"Motion and Path Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Nonholonomic Motion Planning","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T11:04:02Z","dateModified":"2022-10-17T12:44:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ZJSQDGRZ","itemID":1413,"attachments":[{"key":"XJJFJXRQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8928946&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50Lzg5Mjg5NDY=","accessDate":"2022-09-16T11:04:06Z","parentItem":"ZJSQDGRZ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Orthey et al. - 2020 - Motion Planning Explorer Visualizing Local Minima.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-16T11:04:06Z","dateModified":"2022-09-16T11:04:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/XJJFJXRQ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/XJJFJXRQ/Orthey et al. - 2020 - Motion Planning Explorer Visualizing Local Minima.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1414/Orthey et al. - 2020 - Motion Planning Explorer Visualizing Local Minima.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762588,"version":0},"$loki":1290},{"itemID":901,"item":{"key":"ZK2THWJM","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Admissible Abstractions for Near-optimal Task and Motion Planning","abstractNote":"We deÔ¨Åne an admissibility condition for abstractions expressed using angelic semantics and show that these conditions allow us to accelerate planning while preserving the ability to Ô¨Ånd the optimal motion plan.

To date, the most successful approaches for dealing with multi-goal, sparse reward environments have been model-free RL algorithms. In this work we propose PlanGAN, a model-based algorithm specifically designed for solving multi-goal tasks in environments with sparse rewards. Our method builds on the fact that any trajectory of experience collected by an agent contains useful information about how to achieve the goals observed during that trajectory. We use this to train an ensemble of conditional generative models (GANs) to generate plausible trajectories that lead the agent from its current state towards a specified goal. We then combine these imagined trajectories into a novel planning algorithm in order to achieve the desired goal as efficiently as possible. The performance of PlanGAN has been tested on a number of robotic navigation/manipulation tasks in comparison with a range of model-free reinforcement learning baselines, including Hindsight Experience Replay. Our studies indicate that  PlanGAN can achieve comparable performance whilst being around 4-8 times more sample efficient.","date":"2020","shortTitle":"PlanGAN","libraryCatalog":"Neural Information Processing Systems","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/6101903146e4bbf4999c449d78441606-Abstract.html","accessDate":"2022-06-24T14:57:25Z","volume":"33","publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","pages":"8532‚Äì8542","proceedingsTitle":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Charlesworth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Montana","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T14:57:25Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T14:57:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ZN7H8T8I","itemID":866,"attachments":[{"key":"6TUVIFAC","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Full Text PDF","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/6101903146e4bbf4999c449d78441606-Paper.pdf","accessDate":"2022-06-24T14:57:26Z","parentItem":"ZN7H8T8I","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Charlesworth and Montana - 2020 - PlanGAN Model-based Planning With Sparse Rewards .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-24T14:57:26Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T14:57:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/6TUVIFAC","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/6TUVIFAC/Charlesworth and Montana - 2020 - PlanGAN Model-based Planning With Sparse Rewards .pdf","defaultPath":"files/867/Charlesworth and Montana - 2020 - PlanGAN Model-based Planning With Sparse Rewards .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762589,"version":0},"$loki":1292},{"itemID":1238,"item":{"key":"ZPLZ8X5J","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"Introduction to Topological Manifolds","date":"2011","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4419-7940-7","accessDate":"2022-08-11T11:22:51Z","extra":"DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4419-7940-7","volume":"202","place":"New York, NY","publisher":"Springer New York","ISBN":"978-1-4419-7939-1 978-1-4419-7940-7","series":"Graduate Texts in Mathematics","creators":[{"firstName":"John M.","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["429VE8L2"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T11:22:51Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T11:22:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ZPLZ8X5J","itemID":1238,"attachments":[{"key":"M9IBC7IL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Lee - 2011 - Introduction to Topological Manifolds.pdf","parentItem":"ZPLZ8X5J","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lee - 2011 - Introduction to Topological Manifolds.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T11:23:00Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T11:23:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/M9IBC7IL","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/M9IBC7IL/Lee - 2011 - Introduction to Topological Manifolds.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1239/Lee - 2011 - Introduction to Topological Manifolds.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1667816762590,"version":0},"$loki":1293},{"itemID":128,"item":{"key":"ZSG7YD3L","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Flightmare: A Flexible Quadrotor Simulator","abstractNote":"State-of-the-art quadrotor simulators have a rigid and highly-specialized structure: either are they really fast, physically accurate, or photo-realistic. In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor simulator: Flightmare. Flightmare is composed of two main components: a configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics engine for dynamics simulation. Those two components are totally decoupled and can run independently of each other. This makes our simulator extremely fast: rendering achieves speeds of up to 230 Hz, while physics simulation of up to 200,000 Hz on a laptop. In addition, Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) integration with a virtual-reality headset for interaction with the simulated environment.

In order to execute many of the required tasks, robots need, in its architecture, a module of navigation with an appropriate path planning algorithm. This paper presents the development and implementation of a methodology for path planning of a mobile robot using a spherical algorithm and homotopy continuation methods (HCMs). The first section is a brief introduction about HCMs. Subsequently, the homotopy path planning method and spherical path tracking algorithm are explained, as well as the upgraded version and its main features. Then, the main contributions of this paper are presented and the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved. Besides, numerical examples, implementation results in multiple platforms including a 32b microcontroller and robot operating system, are displayed. Finally, some favorable results from a comparative between the proposed methodology against sampling-based planners using the open motion planning library are presented.","date":"2018-04","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","callNumber":"HPPM","extra":"Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","volume":"15","pages":"567-585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TASE.2016.2638208","issue":"2","ISSN":"1558-3783","creators":[{"firstName":"Gerardo","lastName":"Diaz-Arango","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"H√©ctor","lastName":"V√°zquez-Leal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Hernandez-Martinez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mar√≠a Teresa Sanz","lastName":"Pascual","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Sandoval-Hernandez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Planning","type":1},{"tag":"Path planning","type":1},{"tag":"Mobile robots","type":1},{"tag":"Navigation","type":1},{"tag":"path planning algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"Computer architecture","type":1},{"tag":"Computer bugs","type":1},{"tag":"Homotopy continuation methods (HCMs)","type":1},{"tag":"mobile robotics","type":1},{"tag":"open motion planning library","type":1},{"tag":"robot operating system (ROS)","type":1},{"tag":"spherical path tracking algorithm","type":1}],"collections":["MDLBBJKQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T09:57:29Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T12:01:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/ZW7BRNTN","itemID":1235,"attachments":[{"key":"WGF7DWDQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7831359/?arnumber=7831359","accessDate":"2022-08-11T09:57:49Z","parentItem":"ZW7BRNTN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"7831359.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T09:57:49Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T09:57:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/G4sxCe08/items/WGF7DWDQ","localPath":"/home/bencic/phd/bib/zotero/storage/WGF7DWDQ/7831359.html","defaultPath":"files/1237/7831359.html"},{"key":"NXWSC2DV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7831359&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9NzgzMTM1OQ==","accessDate":"2022-08-11T09:57:41Z","parentItem":"ZW7BRNTN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Diaz-Arango et al. -

The step by step investigations of classical and reactive approaches are made here to understand the development of path planning strategies in various environmental conditions and to identify research gap. The classical approaches such as cell decomposition (CD), roadmap approach (RA), artificial potential field (APF); reactive approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), neural network (NN), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), artificial bee colony (ABC), cuckoo search (CS), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and other miscellaneous algorithms (OMA) are considered for study. The navigation over static and dynamic condition is analyzed (for single and multiple robot systems) and it has been observed that the reactive approaches are more robust and perform well in all terrain when compared to classical approaches. It is also observed that the reactive approaches are used to improve the performance of the classical approaches as a hybrid algorithm. Hence, reactive approaches are more popular and widely used for path planning of mobile robot. The paper concludes with tabular data and charts comparing the frequency of individual navigational strategies which can be used for specific application in robotics.","date":"2019-08-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"A review","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914718305130","accessDate":"2022-08-09T07:15:05Z","volume":"15","pages":"582-606","publicationTitle":"Defence Technology","DOI":"10.1016/j.dt.2019.04.011","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Defence Technology","ISSN":"2214-9147","creators":[{"firstName":"B.
