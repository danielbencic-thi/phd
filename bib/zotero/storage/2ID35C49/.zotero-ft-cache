MOTION PLANNING IN TORI
DANIEL C. COHEN† AND GODERDZI PRUIDZE
Abstract. Let X be a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of the n-dimensional torus. We exhibit an explicit optimal motion planning algorithm for X. This construction is used to calculate the topological complexity of complements of general position arrangements and Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces associated to right-angled Artin groups.
1. Introduction
Let X be a path-connected topological space. We assume throughout that X has the homotopy type of a ﬁnite CW-complex. Viewing X as the space of conﬁgurations of a mechanical system, the motion planning problem consists of constructing an algorithm which takes as input pairs of conﬁgurations (x0, x1) ∈ X × X, and produces a continuous path γ : [0, 1] → X from the initial conﬁguration x0 = γ(0) to the terminal conﬁguration x1 = γ(1). The motion planning problem is of interest in robotics, see, for example, Latombe [12] and Sharir [19].
In a recent sequence of papers, Farber [4, 5, 6] develops a topological approach to the motion planning problem. Let P X be the space of all continuous paths γ : [0, 1] → X, equipped with the compact-open topology. The map π : P X → X × X deﬁned by sending a path to its endpoints, π : γ → (γ(0), γ(1)), is a ﬁbration, with ﬁber ΩX, the based loop space of X. The motion planning problem then asks for a section of this ﬁbration, a map s : X × X → P X satisfying π ◦ s = idX×X .
It would be desirable for the motion planning algorithm to depend continuously on the input. However, it is not diﬃcult to show that there exists a globally continuous motion planning s : X × X → P X if and only if X is contractible, see [4, Thm. 1]. This leads to the following deﬁnition, see [5, §2].
Deﬁnition 1.1. A motion planner for X is a collection of subsets F1, . . . , Fk of X × X and continuous maps si : Fi → P X such that
(1) the sets Fi are pairwise disjoint, Fi ∩ Fj = ∅ if i = j, and cover X × X, X × X = F1 ∪ · · · ∪ Fk;
(2) π ◦ si = idFi for each i; and (3) each Fi is a Euclidean Neighborhood Retract.
The sets Fi are referred to as the local domains of the motion planner, and the maps si are the local rules.

Call a motion planner optimal if it requires a minimal number of local domains (resp.,

rules). Deﬁne the topological complexity of X, TC(X), to be the number of local domains in

an optimal motion planner for X. In this paper, we determine the topological complexity of an

arbitrary subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of the n-dimensional torus (S1)×n.

Examples include the skeleta of the n-torus, as well as cell complexes associated to right-angled

Artin groups. We calculate the topological complexity of these spaces by explicitly exhibiting

optimal motion planners. Our methods also yield analogous motion planners for standard

subcomplexes of S×n, where S is a sphere of any dimension.

In [6, §31], Farber poses the problem of computing the topological complexity of an aspher-

ical space X, a space for which the higher homotopy groups vanish, πi(X) = 0 for i ≥ 2. We

solve this problem in the case where X = K(G, 1) is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space associated

to an arbitrary right-angled Artin group G.

Let Γ = (VΓ, EΓ) be a ﬁnite graph with vertex set VΓ, edge set EΓ ⊆

VΓ 2

,

and

no

loops

or

multiple edges. The right-angled Artin group, or graph group, associated to Γ is the group G =

GΓ with generators v corresponding to vertices v ∈ VΓ of Γ, and commutator relators vw = wv corresponding to edges {v, w} ∈ EΓ of Γ. Let XΓ be the subcomplex of the standard CWdecomposition of the n-dimensional torus (S1)×n obtained by deleting the cells corresponding

to noncliques of Γ. As shown by Charney and Davis [1] and Meier and Van Wyk [14], the

complex XΓ is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space of type K(GΓ, 1).

Theorem. Let Γ be a ﬁnite simplicial graph. Then the topological complexity of the associated cell complex XΓ is TC(XΓ) = z(Γ) + 1, where

z(Γ)

=

max
K1 ,K2

|VK1

is the largest number of vertices of Γ covered by precisely two cliques K1 and K2 in Γ.

Let A be an arrangement of hyperplanes in Cℓ, a ﬁnite collection of codimension one aﬃne
subspaces. A principal object in the topological study of arrangements is the complement XA = Cℓ \ H∈A H. The study of the topological complexity of complements of arrangements was initiated by Farber and Yuzvinsky [7], who determined TC(XA) for numerous arrangements, including the braid arrangement, with complement XA = Fℓ(C), the conﬁguration space of ℓ ordered points in C. Their results imply that, for an arrangement A of n hyperplanes in general position in Cℓ, if n ≥ 2ℓ, then TC(XA) = 2ℓ + 1. Left open by these results is the case of an arbitrary general position arrangement.
By a classical result of Hattori [9], the complement XA of an arrangement A of n > ℓ general position hyperplanes in Cℓ has the homotopy type of the ℓ-dimensional skeleton (S1)×ℓ n of the n-dimensional torus. (If n ≤ ℓ, then XA ≃ (S1)×n = (S1)×n n has the homotopy type of the n-torus.) Since topological complexity is a homotopy-type invariant (see [4, Thm. 3] and Section 2 below), we have TC(XA) = TC((S1)×ℓ n).
Theorem. Let A be an arrangement of n hyperplanes in general position in Cℓ. Then the topological complexity of the complement XA is TC(XA) = min {n + 1, 2ℓ + 1}.

This recovers a recent result of Yuzvinsky [20]. The cell complexes XΓ associated to right-angled Artin groups and complements XA of (general position) hyperplane arrangements are known to be formal spaces, in the sense of Sullivan. Our results support the conjecture (stated explicitly for arrangements in [20]) that the topological complexity of a formal space X is determined by the cohomology ring of X.

This note is organized as follows. After brieﬂy recalling some relevant results on topological complexity and motion planning in Section 2, we produce an optimal motion planner for an arbitrary subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n, where S is an odd-dimensional
sphere, in Section 3. Cell complexes associated to right-angled Artin groups and complements of general position hyperplane arrangements, as well as higher-dimensional analogues, are an-
alyzed in Section 4 and Section 5 respectively. In Section 6, we exhibit an optimal motion planner for an arbitrary subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n, where S is
an even-dimensional sphere.

2. Topological complexity and motion planning
Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration. The sectional category, or Schwarz genus, of p, denoted by secat(p), is the smallest integer k such that B can be covered by k open subsets, over each of which p has a continuous section. See James [10] as a classical reference. The topological nature of the motion planning problem is made clear by the following result.

Theorem 2.1 ([6, cf. §13]). Let X be a simplicial polyhedron. Then the topological complexity of X is equal to the sectional category of the path-space ﬁbration π : P X → X × X,
TC(X) = secat(π).

In [4, Thm. 3], Farber shows that the sectional category of the path-space ﬁbration π : P X → X × X, and hence the topological complexity of X, is an invariant of the homotopy type of X. From the realization TC(X) = secat(π), one also obtains a number of bounds on the topological complexity of X in terms of the dimension and the Lusternik-Schnirelman category cat(X). For instance, one has

cat(X) ≤ TC(X) ≤ 2 cat(X) − 1 ≤ 2 dim(X) + 1.

We will not have cause to use these bounds. We will, however, make extensive use of a

cohomological lower bound provided by the realization TC(X) = secat(π).

Let k be a ﬁeld, and let A =

ℓ k=0

Ak

be

a

graded

k-algebra

with

Ak

ﬁnite-dimensional

for each k. Deﬁne the cup length of A, denoted by cl(A), to be the largest integer q for which

there are homogeneous elements a1, . . . , aq of positive degree in A such that a1 · · · aq = 0. If

p : E → B is a ﬁbration, the sectional category admits the following lower bound:

secat(p) > cl ker(p∗ : H∗(B; k) → H∗(E; k) ,

see [10, §8]. We subsequently work exclusively with a ﬁxed ﬁeld k of characteristic zero, and suppress coeﬃcients in cohomology, writing H∗(Y ) = H∗(Y ; k) for ease of notation.
For the path-space ﬁbration π : P X → X × X, using the fact that P X ≃ X and the Ku¨nneth formula, the kernel of π∗ : H∗(X × X) → H∗(P X) may be identiﬁed with the kernel Z = Z(H∗(X)) of the cup-product map H∗(X) ⊗ H∗(X) −−∪→ H∗(X), see [4, Thm. 7]. Call the cup length of the ideal Z of zero divisors the zero-divisor cup length of H∗(X), and write zcl(H∗(X)) = cl(Z).

Proposition 2.2. The topological complexity of X is greater than the zero-divisor cup length of H∗(X),
TC(X) > zcl(H∗(X)).

We conclude this section by recalling the construction of a motion planner for a product

space X × Y from [5, §12]. Suppose that X admits a motion planner X × X = F1 ∪ · · · ∪ Fk, fi : Fi → P X, for which F1 ∪ · · · ∪ Fi is closed for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Analogously, suppose Y admits a motion planner Y × Y = G1 ∪ · · · ∪ Gℓ, gj : Gj → P Y , with G1 ∪ · · · ∪ Gj closed for each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ. Identify (X × Y ) × (X × Y ) = X × X × Y × Y . For each r, 2 ≤ r ≤ k + ℓ,

let

Vr =

Fi × Gj ,

i+j=r

and deﬁne hr : Vr → P (X × Y ) by hr|Fi×Gj = fi × gj .

Proposition 2.3. The subsets Vr ⊂ (X × Y ) × (X × Y ) and maps hr : Vr → P (X × Y ), 2 ≤ r ≤ k + ℓ, are the local domains and rules of a motion planner for X × Y . Hence,

TC(X × Y ) ≤ TC(X) + TC(Y ) − 1.

3. Motion planning in subcomplexes of tori

Let S be an odd-dimensional sphere. View S = S2k−1 as the set of all points x ∈ Ck with
|x| = 1. Analogously, view S×n = S × · · · × S as the set of all points x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ (Ck)n such that |xi| = 1 for each i. Let e = (1, 0, . . . , 0) be the (ﬁrst) standard unit vector in Ck. We will work with the standard CW-decomposition of S×n, with cells given by

(3.1)

S×J n = {x ∈ S×n | xi = e if j ∈/ J, xi = e if j ∈ J }

for subsets J of [n] = {1, . . . , n}.

The purpose of this section is to exhibit an optimal motion planner for an arbitrary subcomplex X of this CW-decomposition of S×n. Subcomplexes of products of even-dimensional
spheres behave diﬀerently, and are treated in Section 6. While the primary focus in the ap-

plications presented in Sections 4 and 5 will be on subcomplexes of the n-dimensional torus (S1)×n, the construction is independent of (odd) dimension. So we present the general case.
We begin by recalling a motion planner for S itself.

Example 3.1 ([6, Ex. 7.5]). The sphere S = S2k−1 admits a motion planner with 2 local
domains. Let F1 ⊂ S × S be the subset consisting of all pairs of antipodal points, F1 = {(x, −x) | x ∈ S}, and deﬁne s1 : F1 → P S as follows: Fix the standard nowhere zero tangent vector ﬁeld ν on S, and move x towards −x along the semicircle tangent to the vector ν(x).
For a second local domain, let F2 = S × S \ F1 be the complement of F1 in S × S. For (x, y) ∈ F2, we have x = −y and we may deﬁne s2 : F2 → P S by moving x towards y along the shortest geodesic arc.
A calculation in the cohomology ring reveals that zcl(H∗(S)) = 1, so TC(S) = 2 and the
above motion planner is optimal.

Remark 3.2. The topological complexity of an even-dimensional sphere is TC(S2k) = 3, see [4, Thm. 8]. An optimal motion planner for S2k is exhibited in Example 6.1.

Note that the set F1 of pairs of antipodal points is closed in S × S. Consequently, we may apply the algorithm of [5, §12] to obtain a motion planner for the product space S×2 = S × S,
see Proposition 2.3 and the preceding discussion. Iterating this construction, we obtain a motion planner for S×n. For a subset I ⊆ [n], deﬁne

(3.2)

FI = {(x, y) ∈ S×n × S×n | xi = −yi if i ∈ I, xi = −yi if i ∈/ I},

MOTION PLANNING IN TORI

and deﬁne sI : FI → P S×n using the maps s1 and s2 given in Example 3.1 coordinate-wise. For (x, y) = (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) , set

sI (x, y) = t1(x1, y1), . . . , tn(xn, yn) ∈ P S × · · · × P S = P S×n,

where ti = s1 if i ∈ I, and ti = s2 if i ∈/ I. For j = 0, 1, . . . , n, let

Wj =

FI ,

|I |=n−j
and deﬁne σj : Wj → P S×n by σj |FI = sI .

Proposition 3.3. The subsets Wj ⊂ S×n × S×n and maps σj : Wj → P S×n are the local domains and rules of an optimal motion planner for S×n. Hence, TC(S×n) = n + 1.

Proof. It is clear from the above construction that the subsets Wj ⊂ S×n × S×n and maps σj : Wj → P S×n comprise a motion planner for S×n, so TC(S×n) ≤ n + 1.
If S is the (2k − 1)-sphere, the cohomology ring H∗(S×n) is an exterior algebra on degree

2k − 1 generators e1, . . . , en. Let e¯i = 1 ⊗ ei − ei ⊗ 1 ∈ H∗(S) ⊗ H∗(S), and note that e¯i is a

zero-divisor. Checking that

n i=1

e¯i

=

0

in

H∗(S×n × S×n),

we

have

zcl(H ∗ (S×n ))

≥

n.

Hence,

as shown in [4, Thm. 13], the topological complexity of S×n is equal to n + 1. Consequently,

the motion planner constructed above is optimal.

Now let X be a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n. We will use the motion planner for S×n constructed above to produce an optimal motion planner for X. First, we need a deﬁnition. For J ⊂ [n], let TJ ∼= S×|J| denote the subcomplex of S×n given by TJ = {x ∈ S×n | xi = e if i ∈/ J}. If J and K are disjoint subsets of [n], then TJ ∩ TK = (e, . . . , e) is a point, and TJ ∪ TK = TJ ∨ TK is the wedge of TJ and TK , and is a subcomplex of S×n. Deﬁne
z(X) = max {|J| + |K| | J ∩ K = ∅ and TJ ∨ TK is a subcomplex of X} .
Note that, for instance, the set K may be empty.

Theorem 3.4. Let X be a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n. Then X admits an optimal motion planner with z(X) + 1 local domains. Hence, TC(X) = z(X) + 1.

We will establish this result by (i) exhibiting a motion planner for X with z(X) + 1 local domains, and (ii) showing that the zero-divisor cup length of H∗(X) is at least z(X).

Proposition 3.5. Let X be a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n. Then X admits a motion planner with at most z(X) + 1 local domains.

Proof. Let σj (X) denote the restriction of the map σj : Wj → P S×n to (X × X) ∩ Wj. We

assert that the decomposition X × X =

n j=n−z(X

)

(X

×

X) ∩

Wj ,

together

with

the

maps

σj(X), n − z(X) ≤ j ≤ n, comprise a motion planner for X. The cells of X are of the form

AJ = S×J n for certain subsets J of [n]. Consequently, X × X admits a CW-decomposition with

cells AJ × AK for certain subsets J and K of [n]. Note that if AJ × AK is a cell of X × X,

then |J ∪ K| ≤ z(X).

Consider the intersection of such a cell AJ × AK with one of the subsets FI deﬁned in (3.2) above. If there exists i ∈ I with i ∈/ J ∪ K, it is readily checked that (AJ × AK ) ∩ FI = ∅. Explicitly, since i ∈ I, we have xi = −yi in FI . Since i ∈/ J and i ∈/ K, we have xi = e and yi = e in AJ × AK . Consequently, (AJ × AK ) ∩ FI = ∅ if I ⊂ J ∪ K.

D. C. COHEN AND G. PRUIDZE

If I ⊂ J ∪ K, then (AJ × AK ) ∩ FI consists of those points (x, y) which satisfy xi = yi = e for i ∈/ J ∪ K, and the following conditons for i ∈ J ∪ K:

xi = −yi, xi = e, yi = e if i ∈ J , i ∈ K, i ∈ I, xi = −yi, xi = e, yi = e if i ∈ J ∩ K, i ∈/ I,

xi = −e, yi = e if i ∈ J, i ∈/ K, i ∈ I,

xi = −e, yi = e if i ∈ J, i ∈/ K, i ∈/ I,

xi = e, yi = −e if i ∈/ J, i ∈ K, i ∈ I,

xi = e, yi = −e if i ∈/ J, i ∈ K, i ∈/ I.

In particular, (AJ × AK ) ∩ FI = ∅ if I ⊂ J ∪ K. The above observations may be used to show that (X ×X)∩Wj = ∅ if j < n−z(X). Fix such
a j, and recall that Wj = |I|=n−j FI . If AJ ×AK is a cell of X ×X, then |J ∪K| ≤ z(X) < |I| for each I with |I| = n − j. Consequently, for each such I, there is an i ∈ I with i ∈/ J and
i ∈/ K, and (AJ × AK ) ∩ FI = ∅. It follows that (X × X) ∩ Wj = ∅ for j < n − z(X). If |I| ≥ n−z(X), let φI denote the restriction of the map sI : FI → P S×n to (AJ ×AK )∩FI .
For (x, y) ∈ S×n × S×n, φI (x, y) is a particular path taking x to y, that is, xi to yi for each
i. Recall that xi is taken to yi in the i-th coordinate sphere along the geodesic determined by the (ﬁxed) vector ﬁeld ν if xi = −yi, and along the shortest geodesic if xi = −yi. Note that the latter is simply a constant path if xi = yi. The above description of (AJ × AK ) ∩ FI may be used to check that the image of φI is contained in P X. If i ∈ J (resp., i ∈ K), then the i-th coordinate sphere is contained in the closure of the cell AJ (resp., AK ) in X. If i ∈/ J and i ∈/ K, then xi = yi = e, and the i-th component of the path φI (x, y) is constant. Consequently, if (x, y) ∈ X × X, then φI (x, y) is a path from x to y in X. It follows that the sets (X × X) ∩ Wj and maps σj(X) : (X × X) ∩ Wj → P X, n − z(X) ≤ j ≤ n, comprise a
motion planner for X as asserted.

The above result implies that TC(X) ≤ z(X) + 1. We establish the reverse inequality by analyzing the cohomology ring H∗(X). As noted in the proof of Proposition 3.3, if S = S2k−1, the cohomology ring H∗(S×n) is an exterior algebra E on degree 2k − 1 generators e1, . . . , en. For J = {j1, . . . , jk} ⊂ [n], let eJ = ej1 · · · ejk ∈ E, and recall that S×J n denotes the corresponding cell of S×n, see (3.1). The following result was established for cell complexes associated to right-angled Artin groups by Charney and Davis [1, Thm. 3.2.4]. Their argument
may be brought to bear on an arbitrary subcomplex of a product of odd-dimensional spheres.
Proposition 3.6. If X is a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n, then the cohomology ring H∗(X) is the quotient of the exterior algebra E by the ideal

IX = eJ | J ⊂ [n] and S×J n is not a cell of X .
Proposition 3.7. If X is a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n, then the zero-divisor cup length of H∗(X) is at least z(X).

Proof. Write z = z(X) and assume that J1 = {1, . . . , k} and J2 = {k + 1, . . . , z} are the underlying index sets of the subcomplex TJ1 ∨ TJ2 of X realizing z(X) = z. First, consider the element e¯1e¯2 · · · e¯z in E ⊗ E, where E is the exterior algebra and e¯i = 1 ⊗ ei − ei ⊗ 1. As noted in [7, Lemma 10] in greater generality (when E is generated in degree 1), one can check
that

(3.3)

e¯1e¯2 · · · e¯z =

(−1)|J|sign(σ) eJ ⊗ eJ′ ,

(J,J ′ )

where the sum is over all partitions (J, J′) by ordered subsets of [z] = {1, . . . , z}, and σ is the shuﬄe on [z] which puts every element of J′ after all elements of J, preserving the orders inside J and J′.

Now consider the cohomology ring H∗(X) = E/IX of the subcomplex X. We assert that the (image of the) element e¯1e¯2 · · · e¯z is non-zero in H∗(X)⊗H∗(X) = E/IX ⊗E/IX . For this, ﬁrst note that ±eJ1 ⊗ eJ2 = ±e1 · · · ek ⊗ ek+1 · · · ez is a summand of (3.3), and that eJ1 and eJ2 are non-zero in H∗(X) since the epimorphic images are non-zero in the cohomology rings H∗(TJ1 ) and H∗(TJ2) respectively. Next, observe that the projection E ⊗ E → E/IX ⊗ E/IX is given by annihilating multiples of elements of the form eK ⊗ 1 and 1 ⊗ eK if S×Kn is not a cell in X. Consequently, the image of the sum (3.3) in E/IX ⊗ E/IX is given by
(−1)|J|sign(σ) eJ ⊗ eJ′
(J,J ′ )
where the sum is over all partitions (J, J′) as above for which there are corresponding subcomplexes TJ and TJ′ of X. In particular, the summand ±eJ1 ⊗ eJ2 survives, and the zero-divisor cup length of H∗(X) = E/IX is at least z = z(X).
Together, Proposition 3.5 and Proposition 3.7 imply that the topological complexity of a subcomplex X of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n is TC(X) = z(X) + 1, thereby proving Theorem 3.4. We note two consequences.
Corollary 3.8. Let X be a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n. Then
(1) the motion planner σj (X) : (X × X) ∩ Wj → P X, n − z(X) ≤ j ≤ n, is optimal, and (2) the zero-divisor cup length of the cohomology ring H∗(X) is zcl(H∗(X)) = z(X).
We conclude this section with two brief applications. In general, the topological complexity of a product space X × Y admits the upper bound TC(X × Y ) ≤ TC(X) + TC(Y ) − 1, see Proposition 2.3. In the case where X and Y are subcomplexes of S×n equality always holds.
Proposition 3.9. If X1 and X2 are subcomplexes of S×n1 and S×n2 , then
TC(X1 × X2) = TC(X1) + TC(X2) − 1.
Proof. By Theorem 3.4, it suﬃces to show that z(X1 × X2) ≥ z(X1) + z(X2). For i = 1, 2, let TJi ∨ TKi be a subcomplex of Xi realizing z(Xi) = |Ji| + |Ki|. Then the product space X1 × X2 contains (TJ1 × TJ2 ) ∨ (TK1 × TK2 ) = TJ ∨ TK as a subcomplex, where J ⊂ [n1 + n2] is the subset corresponding to J1 ⊂ [n1] and J2 ⊂ [n2] in the obvious manner, and similarly for K. Thus,
z(X1 × X2) ≥ |J | + |K| = (|J1| + |J2|) + (|K1| + |K2|) = z(X1) + z(X2)
as required.

A similar result holds for wedges. In general, the topological complexity of a wedge X ∨ Y admits the following upper bound
TC(X ∨ Y ) ≤ max {TC(X), TC(Y ), cat(X) + cat(Y ) − 1} , see [6, Thm. 19.1]. In the case where X and Y are subcomplexes of S×n, equality always holds. Proposition 3.10. If X1 and X2 are subcomplexes of S×n1 and S×n2 , then
TC(X1 ∨ X2) = max {TC(X1), TC(X2), cat(X1) + cat(X2) − 1} .

Proof. For a subcomplex X of S×n, deﬁne
d(X) = max {|J| | TJ is a subcomplex of X} .
Note that if S = S2k−1, then dim(X) = (2k − 1) · d. Note also that X is (2k − 2)-connected. For the wedge X = X1 ∨ X2, observe that z(X) ≥ d(X1) + d(X2). If z(X) is realized by
a subcomplex TJ1 ∨ TK1 of X1, then z(X) = z(X1), and similarly for X2. If neither of these possibilities occurs, then z(X) is realized by a wedge TJ ∨ TK , where TJ is a subcomplex of X1 and TK is a subcomplex of X2. Hence, z(X) = max {z(X1), z(X2), d(X1) + d(X2)}. By Theorem 3.4, we have
TC(X) = TC(X1 ∨ X2) = max {z(X1) + 1, z(X2) + 1, d(X1) + d(X2) + 1} .
Checking that the cup-length in H∗(Xi) is equal to d(Xi), we have cat(Xi) = d(Xi)+1 using the classical inequalities cl(H∗(X))+1 ≤ cat(X) ≤ 1+dim(X)/r for an (r−1)-connected space X, see James [10]. Thus, cat(X1) + cat(X2) − 1 = d(X1) + d(X2) + 1. The result follows.

4. Right-angled Artin groups

Let Γ be a ﬁnite simplicial graph, with vertex set V and edge set E ⊂

V 2

.

Associated to

Γ is a right-angled Artin group GΓ, with a generator v corresponding to each vertex v ∈ V,

and a commutator relation vw = wv for each edge {v, w} ∈ E. That is, the group GΓ has

presentation

GΓ = v ∈ V | vw = wv if {v, w} ∈ E .

Let ∆Γ be the ﬂag complex associated to the graph Γ. The ﬂag complex is the largest simplicial complex with 1-skeleton equal to Γ. The k-simplices of ∆Γ are the (k + 1)-cliques of Γ, i.e., the complete subgraphs on k + 1 vertices in Γ.
Let n = |V| be the cardinality of the vertex set of Γ, and consider the n-torus (S1)×n with its standard CW-decomposition. Denote by XΓ the subcomplex of (S1)×n obtained by deleting the cells corresponding to the non-faces of the ﬂag complex ∆Γ. The complex XΓ is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space of type K(GΓ, 1), see [1, 14].
Let ck(Γ) denote the number of k-cliques in Γ (where c0(Γ) = 1). It is readily checked that the integral homology group Hk(XΓ; Z) is free abelian of rank ck(Γ). Consequently, the Poincar´e polynomial of XΓ is equal to the clique polynomial of the graph

P (XΓ, t) = bk(XΓ)tk = ck(Γ)tk = C(Γ, t).

If the cardinality of the largest clique in Γ is equal to d, then dim XΓ = d. Label the vertices of Γ, and write V = {v1, . . . , vn}. The cohomology ring H∗(XΓ) is the
exterior Stanley-Reisner ring of Γ, see [1, 11]. Explicitly, H∗(XΓ) = E/IΓ is the quotient of the exterior algebra E on generators e1, . . . , en in degree one by the ideal IΓ = eiej | {vi, vj} ∈/ E .
Denote by z(Γ) the maximal number of vertices of Γ that are covered by precisely two
cliques. That is, z(Γ) is the largest cardinality of union of the vertex sets of two cliques in Γ. Observe that z(Γ) may be realized by disjoint cliques in Γ.

Theorem 4.1. If Γ is a ﬁnite simplicial graph, then the topological complexity of the associated cell complex XΓ is TC(XΓ) = z(Γ) + 1.

Proof. By Theorem 3.4, it suﬃces to show that z(Γ) = z(XΓ). Identify the vertex set V of Γ with [n] = {1, . . . , n}, and let J, K ⊂ [n] be disjoint cliques realizing z(Γ). Then J and K

correspond to faces of the ﬂag complex ∆Γ, and it follows that TJ ∨ TK is a subcomplex of XΓ. Consequently, z(Γ) ≤ z(XΓ).
If TJ ∨ TK is a subcomplex of XΓ, then J and K are disjoint, so correspond to disjoint cliques in Γ. This implies that z(XΓ) ≤ z(Γ), so we have z(Γ) = z(XΓ) as required.
Corollary 4.2. Let Γ be a ﬁnite simplicial graph with associated cell complex XΓ. Then the zero-divisor cup length of the cohomology ring H∗(XΓ) is zcl(H∗(XΓ)) = z(Γ).
The cell complex XΓ associated to the graph Γ has higher-dimensional analogues XΓk introduced by Kim and Roush [11]. Fix a positive integer k, and recall that S = S2k−1 is the (2k − 1)-sphere. Given a simplicial graph Γ with |V| = n, let XΓk be the subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n obtained by deleting the cells corresponding to the nonfaces of the ﬂag complex ∆Γ. Note that XΓ1 = XΓ is the K(GΓ, 1)-space considered previously, and that XΓk is simply-connected for k ≥ 2.
The cohomology ring H∗(XΓk) is a rescaling of H∗(XΓ) = E/IΓ in the sense of [17]. Explicitly, if Ek denotes the exterior algebra generated by elements ek1, . . . , ekn of degree 2k − 1, then H∗(XΓk) = Ek/IΓk, where IΓk is the ideal generated by eki ekj | {vi, vj} ∈/ E . It follows that the zero-divisor cup length of H∗(XΓk) is equal to that of H∗(XΓ),
zcl(H∗(XΓk)) = zcl(H∗(XΓ)) = z(Γ). Furthermore, since XΓk is a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n, Theorem 3.4 provides a motion planner for XΓk with local domains (XΓk × XΓk) ∩ Wj , n − z(XΓk) ≤ j ≤ n. Clearly, z(XΓk) = z(Γ). Hence, we have the following generalization of Theorem 4.1.
Theorem 4.3. For any positive integer k, the topological complexity of the complex XΓk is equal to z(Γ) + 1.
Remark 4.4. The complexes XΓk are known to be formal spaces, see [18]. Since XΓk is simply-connected for k ≥ 2, results of [8, 13] imply that the topological complexity of the rationalization (XΓk)Q of XΓk is also equal to z(Γ) + 1 in this instance.
5. General position arrangements
Let A be an arrangement of n aﬃne hyperplanes in general position in Cℓ, with complement XA = Cℓ \ H∈A H. If n ≤ ℓ, it is readily checked that the complement has the homotopy type of the n-dimensional torus, XA ≃ (S1)×n. If n > ℓ, then by a classical result of Hattori [9], the complement has the homotopy type of the ℓ-dimensional skeleton of the n-torus, XA ≃ (S1)×ℓ n. For n ≥ 2ℓ, results of Farber and Yuzvinsky [7] imply that the topological complexity of XA is equal to 2ℓ + 1. For arbitrary n, we have the following.
Theorem 5.1. Let A be an arrangement of n hyperplanes in general position in Cℓ. Then the topological complexity of the complement of A is TC(XA) = min {n + 1, 2ℓ + 1}.
Proof. If n ≤ ℓ, then the topological complexity of XA ≃ (S1)×n is n + 1, see Proposition 3.3. If n > ℓ, since XA ≃ (S1)×ℓ n by Hattori’s theorem, we have TC(XA) = TC((S1)ℓ×n) =
z((S1)×ℓ n) + 1 by Theorem 3.4. So it suﬃces to show that z((S1)ℓ×n) = min {n, 2ℓ}. Let z = min {n, 2ℓ}, and consider the subsets J0 = {1, . . . , ℓ} and K0 = {ℓ + 1, . . . , z} of
[n] = {1, . . . , n}. Then the ℓ-skeleton (S1)×ℓ n of the n-torus contains the wedge of tori TJ0 ∨TK0 as a subcomplex, so z((S1)×ℓ n) ≥ z = min {n, 2ℓ}.

D. C. COHEN AND G. PRUIDZE

To establish the reverse inequality, assume that (S1)×ℓ n contains a wedge of tori TJ ∨ TK as a subcomplex, where J and K are disjoint subsets of [n] and |J| + |K| > z = min {n, 2ℓ}. Since (S1)×ℓ n is ℓ-dimensional, the subsets J and K of [n] are of cardinality at most ℓ. So we have min {n, 2ℓ} < |J| + |K| ≤ 2ℓ, and min {n, 2ℓ} = n. Since |J| + |K| > n, the subsets J and K of [n] cannot be disjoint. This contradiction completes the proof.
Corollary 5.2. Let A be an arrangement of n general position hyperplanes in Cℓ with complement XA. Then the zero-divisor cup length of the cohomology ring H∗(XA) is zcl(H∗(XA)) = min {n, 2ℓ}.
A hyperplane arrangement C in Cℓ is said to be central if every hyperplane of C contains the origin. A central arrangement C is generic if every ℓ element subset of the hyperplanes of C is independent. Note that |C| ≥ ℓ for C generic. In other words, a generic arrangement C of n hyperplanes in Cℓ is the cone of an aﬃne arrangement A of n − 1 general position hyperplanes in Cℓ−1. See Orlik and Terao [15] as a general reference on arrangements.
Theorem 5.3. Let C be a generic arrangement of n hyperplanes in Cℓ. Then the topological complexity of the complement of C is TC(XC) = min {n + 1, 2ℓ}.
Proof. As noted above, the generic arrangement C ⊂ Cℓ is the cone of an aﬃne arrangement A of n − 1 general position hyperplanes in Cℓ−1. The relationship between the complements is well known: We have XC ∼= XA × C∗, see [15, Prop. 5.1]. Since XA ≃ (S1)×ℓ−n1−1 has the homotopy type of the (ℓ − 1)-skeleton of the (n − 1)-torus and C∗ ≃ S1, it follows that XC ≃ (S1)×ℓ−n1−1 × S1. Using Theorem 5.1 and Proposition 3.9, we obtain
TC(XC) = TC((S1)×ℓ−n1−1) + TC(S1) − 1 = TC(XA) + 1 = min {n, 2ℓ − 1} + 1 = min {n + 1, 2ℓ}
as asserted.
Corollary 5.4. Let C be a generic arrangement of n hyperplanes in Cℓ with complement XA. Then the zero-divisor cup length of the cohomology ring H∗(XC) is zcl(H∗(XC)) = min {n, 2ℓ − 1}.
Remark 5.5. After proving Theorems 5.1 and 5.3, we learned that these results had been established previously by Yuzvinsky [20]. The arguments are similar.
Remark 5.6. In [13], Lechuga and Murillo show that the topological complexity of the rationalization XQ of a nilpotent formal space X is given by TC(XQ) = zcl(H∗(XQ)) + 1. It is well known that complements of complex hyperplane arrangements are formal. If A is an arrangement of n general position hyperplanes in Cℓ with ℓ ≥ 2 (resp., C is a generic arrangement in Cℓ with ℓ ≥ 3), the fundamental group G of the complement is free abelian, hence is nilpotent. However, the higher homotopy groups are not, in general, nilpotent as ZG-modules, see [16].
Following [2], to an arrangement A of hyperplanes in Cℓ, we associate a redundant arrangement Ak of codimension k subspaces in Ckℓ. Given a hyperplane H ⊂ Cℓ, let Hk be the codimension k aﬃne subspace of Ckℓ = (Cℓ)k consisting of all k-tuples of points in Cℓ, each of which lies in H. Applying this construction to each of the hyperplanes in A yields an arrangement Ak of codimension k subspaces in Ckℓ, with complement XAk = Ckℓ \ H∈A Hk.
The cohomology ring H∗(XAk ) of the complement of the redundant subspace arrangement is a rescaling of the cohomology ring H∗(XA) of the original hyperplane arrangement. By the Orlik-Solomon theorem, H∗(XA) = E/IA is the quotient of an exterior algebra on n = |A|

degree one generators e1, . . . , en by a certain homogeneous ideal IA, see [15, §§3.1–3.2]. If Ek is the exterior algebra generated by elements ek1, . . . , ekn of degree 2k − 1, and IAk is the ideal in Ek corresponding to the ideal IA of E in the obvious manner, then H∗(XAk ) = Ek/IAk . See [2, §2] for details. It follows that the zero-divisor cup length of H∗(XAk ) is equal to that of H∗(XA), zcl(H∗(XAk )) = zcl(H∗(XA)) for each k.
Theorem 5.7. Let A be an arrangement of n hyperplanes in general position in Cℓ. Then, for each k, the topological complexity of the complement of the redundant subspace arrangement Ak is TC(XAk ) = min {n + 1, 2ℓ + 1}.
Proof. For k = 1, this is Theorem 5.1. So assume that k ≥ 2. Write S = S2k−1. If n ≤ ℓ, checking that XAk ≃ S×n, we have TC(XAk ) = n + 1, see Proposition 3.3. For n > ℓ, as shown by Papadima and Suciu [17, Lemma 8.4], the analogue of Hattori’s
theorem holds for redundant subspace arrangements associated to general position arrangements. If A is a general position arrangement of n hyperplanes in Cℓ, then the complement of the subspace arrangement Ak has the homotopy type of the (2k − 1)ℓ-skeleton (S×n)ℓ of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n. Since XAk ≃ (S×n)ℓ, by Theorem 3.4, it suﬃces to show that z((S×n)ℓ) = min {n, 2ℓ}. This may be accomplished by generalizing the argument given in the proof of Theorem 5.1 in the obvious manner.

If u and v are two distinct points in a manifold X, the open string conﬁguration space is
Gn(X, u, v) = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ X×n | x1 = u, xn = v, xi = xi+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 .
These conﬁguration spaces arise naturally in the topological study of billiard problems, see [3].
Proposition 5.8. The open string conﬁguration space Gn(Ck, u, v) is equal to the complement XAk of a redundant subspace arrangement associated to an arrangement A of n + 1 hyperplanes in general position in Cn.
Proof. Choose coordinates y1, . . . , yn on Cn, and let A ⊂ Cn be the arrangement of n + 1 hyperplanes deﬁned by the polynomial Q(A) = y1(yn − 1) in=−11(yi − yi+1). It is readily checked that the hyperplanes of A are in general position.
Without loss of generality, take u = (0, . . . , 0) and v = (1, . . . , 1) in Ck. It is then a straightforward exercise to check that Gn(Ck, u, v) coincides with the complement of the subspace arrangement Ak associated to the hyperplane arrangement A in Cn deﬁned above.

This result, together with Theorem 5.7, yields the following.
Corollary 5.9. The topological complexity of the open string conﬁguration space Gn(Ck, u, v) is equal to n + 2.

6. Products of even-dimensional spheres
In this section, we consider the case of an even-dimensional sphere S = S2k. View the product space S×n = S × · · · × S as the set of points x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ (R2k+1)n such that |xi| = 1 for each i, and let e = (1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ R2k+1. Let X be a subcomplex of the standard CWdecomposition of S×n, the latter with cells S×J n = {x ∈ S×n | xi = e if j ∈/ J, xi = e if j ∈ J } for subsets J of [n]. We will construct an optimal motion planner for X.

Example 6.1 ([6, Ex. 7.5]). The sphere S = S2k admits a motion planner with 3 local
domains. Let F0 = {(e, −e)} ⊂ S × S, where e is the ﬁxed point given above, and choose the local rule s0 to be any ﬁxed path from e to −e.
Let F1 ⊂ S × S be the subset consisting of all pairs of antipodal points except (e, −e), F1 = {(x, −x) ∈ S × S | x = e}, and deﬁne s1 : F1 → P S as follows. Fix a nowhere zero tangent vector ﬁeld ν on S \ {e}, and move x towards −x along the semicircle tangent to the
vector ν(x).
For a third local domain, let F2 = S × S \ (F0 ∪ F1) = {(x, y) ∈ S × S | x = −y} be the complement of the union of F0 and F1 in S × S. For (x, y) ∈ F2, we have x = −y and we may deﬁne s2 : F2 → P S by moving x towards y along the shortest geodesic arc.
One can check that zcl(H∗(S)) = 2, so TC(S) = 3 and the above motion planner is optimal.

Applying the algorithm of [5, §12] summarized in Proposition 2.3, we obtain a motion planner for S×n. Since we now have choices of 3 local domains for each sphere S, we parameterize (subsets of) local domains of S×n using multi-indices α = (α(1), . . . , α(n)), where
α(i) ∈ {0, 1, 2}, that is, using functions α : [n] → {0, 1, 2}. Given α, deﬁne

Fα = (x, y) ∈ S×n × S×n | (xi, yi) ∈ Fα(i) ,

and deﬁne sα : Fα → P S×n using the maps s0, s1 and s2 given in Example 6.1 coordinate-wise. For (x, y) = (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) , set

sα(x, y) = t1(x1, y1), . . . , tn(xn, yn) ∈ P S × · · · × P S = P S×n,

where ti = sα(i). For j = 0, 1, . . . , 2n, let

Wj =

Fα,

|α|=j

where |α| = α(1) + · · · + α(n), and deﬁne σj : Wj → P S×n by σj |Fα = sα.

Proposition 6.2. The subsets Wj ⊂ S×n × S×n and maps σj : Wj → P S×n are the local domains and rules of an optimal motion planner for S×n. Hence, TC(S×n) = 2n + 1.

Proof. It is clear from the above construction that the subsets Wj ⊂ S×n × S×n and maps σj : Wj → P S×n comprise a motion planner for S×n, so TC(S×n) ≤ 2n + 1.
If S is the 2k-sphere, the cohomology ring H∗(S×n) is a commutative algebra of square-

free monomials on degree 2k generators e1, . . . , en. The zero-divisor e¯i = 1 ⊗ ei − ei ⊗ 1 in

H∗(S) ⊗ H∗(S) satisﬁes (e¯i)2 = −2e¯i ⊗ e¯i = 0 since we work with coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld k of

characteristic zero. Checking that

have

2n. Hence, as shown in [4, Thm. 13], the topological complexity of S×n is equal to 2n + 1.

Consequently, the motion planner constructed above is optimal.

Now let X be a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of S×n. In contrast to the odd-dimensional case, the topological complexity of X is determined by the dimension of X.

Theorem 6.3. Let S = S2k be an even-dimensional sphere, and let X be a 2kℓ-dimensional subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of the product space S×n. Then the topological
complexity of X is TC(X) = 2ℓ + 1.

Proof. First we show that X admits a motion planner with 2ℓ + 1 local domains and rules. We assert that (X × X) ∩ Wj = ∅ for each j, 0 ≤ j ≤ 2n − 2ℓ − 1. Given α ∈ {0, 1, 2}×n,

identify Fα = Fα(1) × · · · × Fα(n), and deﬁne Iα ⊆ [n] by Iα = {i ∈ [n] | α(i) < 2}. That is, Iα is the set of indices i for which Fα(i) contains only antipodal points in S, the i-th sphere in the product S×n.
The cells of X are of the form AJ = S×J n for certain subsets J of [n]. Consequently, X × X admits a CW-decomposition with cells AJ × AK for certain subsets J and K of [n]. If α
satisﬁes |α| < 2n − 2ℓ, we can ﬁnd i ∈ Iα with i ∈/ J ∪ K. In this situation, it is readily checked
that (AJ × AK ) ∩ Fα = ∅. Consequently, {(X × X) ∩ Wj | 2n − 2ℓ ≤ j ≤ 2n} is a set of 2ℓ + 1
local domains of a motion planner for X. For 2n − 2ℓ ≤ j ≤ 2n, let σj(X) denote the restriction of the map σj : Wj → P S×n to
(X × X) ∩ Wj. Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 3.4, one can show that that the image of σj(X) is contained in P X. It follows that the maps σj(X), 2n − 2ℓ ≤ j ≤ 2n, are local rules
for the motion planner on X with local domains given above. Since the complex X is 2kℓ-dimensional, it must contain at least one copy of S×ℓ as a
subcomplex. Let τ : S×ℓ → X be the inclusion of such a subcomplex. Checking that this inclusion induces an epimorphism τ ∗ : H∗(X) → H∗(S×ℓ) in cohomology, we conclude that zcl(H∗(X)) ≥ zcl(H∗(S×ℓ)) = 2ℓ, and TC(X) ≥ 2ℓ + 1. Thus, the topological complexity of
X is equal to 2ℓ + 1.

Remark 6.4. If X is r-connected, then

TC(X )

see [5, Thm. 5.2]. This inequality may be used to verify that the topological complexity of a 2kℓ-dimensional subcomplex X of S×n is bounded above by 2ℓ + 1. Note, however, that the
proof of Theorem 6.3 provides an explicit optimal motion planner for X.
