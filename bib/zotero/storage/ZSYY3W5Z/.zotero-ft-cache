Preface
Manifolds crop up everywhere in mathematics. These generalizations of curves and surfaces to arbitrarily many dimensions provide the mathematical context for understanding “space” in all of its manifestations. Today, the tools of manifold theory are indispensable in most major subﬁelds of pure mathematics, and are becoming increasingly important in such diverse ﬁelds as genetics, robotics, econometrics, statistics, computer graphics, biomedical imaging, and, of course, the undisputed leader among consumers (and inspirers) of mathematics—theoretical physics. No longer the province of differential geometers alone, smooth manifold technology is now a basic skill that all mathematics students should acquire as early as possible.
Over the past century or two, mathematicians have developed a wondrous collection of conceptual machines that enable us to peer ever more deeply into the invisible world of geometry in higher dimensions. Once their operation is mastered, these powerful machines enable us to think geometrically about the 6-dimensional solution set of a polynomial equation in four complex variables, or the 10-dimensional manifold of 5 5 orthogonal matrices, as easily as we think about the familiar 2-dimensional sphere in R3. The price we pay for this power, however, is that the machines are assembled from layer upon layer of abstract structure. Starting with the familiar raw materials of Euclidean spaces, linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and differential equations, one must progress through topological spaces, smooth atlases, tangent bundles, immersed and embedded submanifolds, vector ﬁelds, ﬂows, cotangent bundles, tensors, Riemannian metrics, differential forms, foliations, Lie derivatives, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and more—just to get to the point where one can even think about studying specialized applications of manifold theory such as comparison theory, gauge theory, symplectic topology, or Ricci ﬂow.
This book is designed as a ﬁrst-year graduate text on manifold theory, for students who already have a solid acquaintance with undergraduate linear algebra, real analysis, and topology. I have tried to focus on the portions of manifold theory that will be needed by most people who go on to use manifolds in mathematical or scientiﬁc research. I introduce and use all of the standard tools of the subject, and prove most of its fundamental theorems, while avoiding unnecessary generalization

Preface

or specialization. I try to keep the approach as concrete as possible, with pictures and intuitive discussions of how one should think geometrically about the abstract concepts, but without shying away from the powerful tools that modern mathematics has to offer. To ﬁt in all of the basics and still maintain a reasonably sane pace, I have had to omit or barely touch on a number of important topics, such as complex manifolds, inﬁnite-dimensional manifolds, connections, geodesics, curvature, ﬁber bundles, sheaves, characteristic classes, and Hodge theory. Think of them as dessert, to be savored after completing this book as the main course.
To convey the book’s compass, it is easiest to describe where it starts and where it ends. The starting line is drawn just after topology: I assume that the reader has had a rigorous introduction to general topology, including the fundamental group and covering spaces. One convenient source for this material is my Introduction to Topological Manifolds [LeeTM], which I wrote partly with the aim of providing the topological background needed for this book. There are other books that cover similar material well; I am especially fond of the second edition of Munkres’s Topology [Mun00]. The ﬁnish line is drawn just after a broad and solid background has been established, but before getting into the more specialized aspects of any particular subject. In particular, I introduce Riemannian metrics, but I do not go into connections, geodesics, or curvature. There are many Riemannian geometry books for the interested student to take up next, including one that I wrote [LeeRM] with the goal of moving expediently in a one-quarter course from basic smooth manifold theory to nontrivial geometric theorems about curvature and topology. Similar material is covered in the last two chapters of the recent book by Jeffrey Lee (no relation) [LeeJeff09], and do Carmo [dC92] covers a bit more. For more ambitious readers, I recommend the beautiful books by Petersen [Pet06], Sharpe [Sha97], and Chavel [Cha06].
This subject is often called “differential geometry.” I have deliberately avoided using that term to describe what this book is about, however, because the term applies more properly to the study of smooth manifolds endowed with some extra structure—such as Lie groups, Riemannian manifolds, symplectic manifolds, vector bundles, foliations—and of their properties that are invariant under structurepreserving maps. Although I do give all of these geometric structures their due (after all, smooth manifold theory is pretty sterile without some geometric applications), I felt that it was more honest not to suggest that the book is primarily about one or all of these geometries. Instead, it is about developing the general tools for working with smooth manifolds, so that the reader can go on to work in whatever ﬁeld of differential geometry or its cousins he or she feels drawn to.
There is no canonical linear path through this material. I have chosen an ordering of topics designed to establish a good technical foundation in the ﬁrst half of the book, so that I can discuss interesting applications in the second half. Once the ﬁrst twelve chapters have been completed, there is some ﬂexibility in ordering the remaining chapters. For example, Chapter 13 (Riemannian Metrics) can be postponed if desired, although some sections of Chapters 15 and 16 would have to be postponed as well. On the other hand, Chapters 19–21 (Distributions and Foliations, The Exponential Map, and Quotient Manifolds, respectively) could in principle be

inserted any time after Chapter 14, and much of the material can be covered even earlier if you are willing to skip over the references to differential forms. And the ﬁnal chapter (Symplectic Manifolds) would make sense any time after Chapter 17, or even after Chapter 14 if you skip the references to de Rham cohomology.
As you might have guessed from the size of the book, and will quickly conﬁrm when you start reading it, my style tends toward more detailed explanations and proofs than one typically ﬁnds in graduate textbooks. I realize this is not to every instructor’s taste, but in my experience most students appreciate having the details spelled out when they are ﬁrst learning the subject. The detailed proofs in the book provide students with useful models of rigor, and can free up class time for discussion of the meanings and motivations behind the deﬁnitions as well as the “big ideas” underlying some of the more difﬁcult proofs. There are plenty of opportunities in the exercises and problems for students to provide arguments of their own.
I should say something about my choices of conventions and notations. The old joke that “differential geometry is the study of properties that are invariant under change of notation” is funny primarily because it is alarmingly close to the truth. Every geometer has his or her favorite system of notation, and while the systems are all in some sense formally isomorphic, the transformations required to get from one to another are often not at all obvious to students. Because one of my central goals is to prepare students to read advanced texts and research articles in differential geometry, I have tried to choose notations and conventions that are as close to the mainstream as I can make them without sacriﬁcing too much internal consistency. (One difference between this edition and the previous one is that I have changed a number of my notational conventions to make them more consistent with mainstream mathematical usage.) When there are multiple conventions in common use (such as for the wedge product or the Laplace operator), I explain what the alternatives are and alert the student to be aware of which convention is in use by any given writer. Striving for too much consistency in this subject can be a mistake, however, and I have eschewed absolute consistency whenever I felt it would get in the way of ease of understanding. I have also introduced some common shortcuts at an early stage, such as the Einstein summation convention and the systematic confounding of maps with their coordinate representations, both of which tend to drive students crazy at ﬁrst, but pay off enormously in efﬁciency later.

Prerequisites
This subject draws on most of the topics that are covered in a typical undergraduate mathematics education. The appendices (which most readers should read, or at least skim, ﬁrst) contain a cursory summary of prerequisite material on topology, linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations. Although students who have not seen this material before will not learn it from reading the appendices, I hope readers will appreciate having all of the background material collected in one place. Besides giving me a convenient way to refer to results that I want to assume as known, it also gives the reader a splendid opportunity to brush up on topics that were once (hopefully) understood but may have faded.

Preface

Exercises and Problems

This book has a rather large number of exercises and problems for the student to work out. Embedded in the text of each chapter are questions labeled as “Exercises.” These are (mostly) short opportunities to ﬁll in gaps in the text. Some of them are routine veriﬁcations that would be tedious to write out in full, but are not quite trivial enough to warrant tossing off as obvious. I recommend that serious readers take the time at least to stop and convince themselves that they fully understand what is involved in doing each exercise, if not to write out a complete solution, because it will make their reading of the text far more fruitful.
At the end of each chapter is a collection of (mostly) longer and harder questions labeled as “Problems.” These are the ones from which I select written homework assignments when I teach this material. Many of them will take hours for students to work through. Only by doing a substantial number of these problems can one hope to absorb this material deeply. I have tried insofar as possible to choose problems that are enlightening in some way and have interesting consequences in their own right. When the result of a problem is used in an essential way in the text, the page where it is used is noted at the end of the problem statement.
I have deliberately not provided written solutions to any of the problems, either in the back of the book or on the Internet. In my experience, if written solutions to problems are available, even the most conscientious students ﬁnd it very hard to resist the temptation to look at the solutions as soon as they get stuck. But it is exactly at that stage of being stuck that students learn most effectively, by struggling to get unstuck and eventually ﬁnding a path through the thicket. Reading someone else’s solution too early can give one a comforting, but ultimately misleading, sense of understanding. If you really feel you have run out of ideas, talk with an instructor, a fellow student, or one of the online mathematical discussion communities such as math.stackexchange.com. Even if someone else gives you a suggestion that turns out to be the key to getting unstuck, you will still learn much more from absorbing the suggestion and working out the details on your own than you would from reading someone else’s polished proof.

About the Second Edition
Those who are familiar with the ﬁrst edition of this book will notice ﬁrst that the topics have been substantially rearranged. This is primarily because I decided it was worthwhile to introduce the two most important analytic tools (the rank theorem and the fundamental theorem on ﬂows) much earlier, so that they can be used throughout the book rather than being relegated to later chapters.
A few new topics have been added, notably Sard’s theorem, some transversality theorems, a proof that inﬁnitesimal Lie group actions generate global group actions, a more thorough study of ﬁrst-order partial differential equations, a brief treatment of degree theory for smooth maps between compact manifolds, and an introduction to contact structures. I have consolidated the introductory treatments of Lie groups,

Riemannian metrics, and symplectic manifolds in chapters of their own, to make it easier to concentrate on the special features of those subjects when they are ﬁrst introduced (although Lie groups and Riemannian metrics still appear repeatedly in later chapters). In addition, manifolds with boundary are now treated much more systematically throughout the book.
Apart from additions and rearrangement, there are thousands of small changes and also some large ones. Parts of every chapter have been substantially rewritten to improve clarity. Some proofs that seemed too labored in the original have been streamlined, while others that seemed unclear have been expanded. I have modiﬁed some of my notations, usually moving toward more consistency with common notations in the literature. There is a new notation index just before the subject index.
There are also some typographical improvements in this edition. Most importantly, mathematical terms are now typeset in bold italics when they are ofﬁcially deﬁned, to reﬂect the fact that deﬁnitions are just as important as theorems and proofs but ﬁt better into the ﬂow of paragraphs rather than being called out with special headings. The exercises in the text are now indicated more clearly with a special symbol (I), and numbered consecutively with the theorems to make them easier to ﬁnd. The symbol , in addition to marking the ends of proofs, now also marks the ends of statements of corollaries that follow so easily that they do not need proofs; and I have introduced the symbol // to mark the ends of numbered examples. The entire book is now set in Times Roman, supplemented by the excellent MathTime Professional II mathematics fonts from Personal TEX, Inc.

Acknowledgments

Many people have contributed to the development of this book in indispensable ways. I would like to mention Tom Duchamp, Jim Isenberg, and Steve Mitchell, all of whom generously shared their own notes and ideas about teaching this subject; and Gary Sandine, who made lots of helpful suggestions and created more than a third of the illustrations in the book. In addition, I would like to thank the many others who have read the book and sent their corrections and suggestions to me. (In the Internet age, textbook writing becomes ever more a collaborative venture.) And most of all, I owe a debt of gratitude to Judith Arms, who has improved the book in countless ways with her thoughtful and penetrating suggestions.
For the sake of future readers, I hope each reader will take the time to keep notes of any mistakes or passages that are awkward or unclear, and let me know about them as soon as it is convenient for you. I will keep an up-to-date list of corrections on my website, whose address is listed below. (Sad experience suggests that there will be plenty of corrections despite my best efforts to root them out in advance.) If that site becomes unavailable for any reason, the publisher will know where to ﬁnd me. Happy reading!

Chapter 1
Smooth Manifolds

This book is about smooth manifolds. In the simplest terms, these are spaces that locally look like some Euclidean space Rn, and on which one can do calculus. The most familiar examples, aside from Euclidean spaces themselves, are smooth plane curves such as circles and parabolas, and smooth surfaces such as spheres, tori, paraboloids, ellipsoids, and hyperboloids. Higher-dimensional examples include the set of points in RnC1 at a constant distance from the origin (an n-sphere) and graphs of smooth maps between Euclidean spaces.
The simplest manifolds are the topological manifolds, which are topological spaces with certain properties that encode what we mean when we say that they “locally look like” Rn. Such spaces are studied intensively by topologists.
However, many (perhaps most) important applications of manifolds involve calculus. For example, applications of manifold theory to geometry involve such properties as volume and curvature. Typically, volumes are computed by integration, and curvatures are computed by differentiation, so to extend these ideas to manifolds would require some means of making sense of integration and differentiation on a manifold. Applications to classical mechanics involve solving systems of ordinary differential equations on manifolds, and the applications to general relativity (the theory of gravitation) involve solving a system of partial differential equations.
The ﬁrst requirement for transferring the ideas of calculus to manifolds is some notion of “smoothness.” For the simple examples of manifolds we described above, all of which are subsets of Euclidean spaces, it is fairly easy to describe the meaning of smoothness on an intuitive level. For example, we might want to call a curve “smooth” if it has a tangent line that varies continuously from point to point, and similarly a “smooth surface” should be one that has a tangent plane that varies continuously. But for more sophisticated applications it is an undue restriction to require smooth manifolds to be subsets of some ambient Euclidean space. The ambient coordinates and the vector space structure of Rn are superﬂuous data that often have nothing to do with the problem at hand. It is a tremendous advantage to be able to work with manifolds as abstract topological spaces, without the excess baggage of such an ambient space. For example, in general relativity, spacetime is modeled as a 4-dimensional smooth manifold that carries a certain geometric structure, called a

1 Smooth Manifolds

Fig. 1.1 A homeomorphism from a circle to a square
Lorentz metric, whose curvature results in gravitational phenomena. In such a model there is no physical meaning that can be assigned to any higher-dimensional ambient space in which the manifold lives, and including such a space in the model would complicate it needlessly. For such reasons, we need to think of smooth manifolds as abstract topological spaces, not necessarily as subsets of larger spaces.
It is not hard to see that there is no way to deﬁne a purely topological property that would serve as a criterion for “smoothness,” because it cannot be invariant under homeomorphisms. For example, a circle and a square in the plane are homeomorphic topological spaces (Fig. 1.1), but we would probably all agree that the circle is “smooth,” while the square is not. Thus, topological manifolds will not sufﬁce for our purposes. Instead, we will think of a smooth manifold as a set with two layers of structure: ﬁrst a topology, then a smooth structure.
In the ﬁrst section of this chapter we describe the ﬁrst of these structures. A topological manifold is a topological space with three special properties that express the notion of being locally like Euclidean space. These properties are shared by Euclidean spaces and by all of the familiar geometric objects that look locally like Euclidean spaces, such as curves and surfaces. We then prove some important topological properties of manifolds that we use throughout the book.
In the next section we introduce an additional structure, called a smooth structure, that can be added to a topological manifold to enable us to make sense of derivatives.
Following the basic deﬁnitions, we introduce a number of examples of manifolds, so you can have something concrete in mind as you read the general theory. At the end of the chapter we introduce the concept of a smooth manifold with boundary, an important generalization of smooth manifolds that will have numerous applications throughout the book, especially in our study of integration in Chapter 16.
Topological Manifolds
In this section we introduce topological manifolds, the most basic type of manifolds. We assume that the reader is familiar with the deﬁnition and basic properties of topological spaces, as summarized in Appendix A.
Suppose M is a topological space. We say that M is a topological manifold of dimension n or a topological n-manifold if it has the following properties:

Topological Manifolds

3

M is a Hausdorff space: for every pair of distinct points p; q 2 M; there are disjoint open subsets U; V Â M such that p 2 U and q 2 V . M is second-countable: there exists a countable basis for the topology of M . M is locally Euclidean of dimension n: each point of M has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of Rn.
The third property means, more speciﬁcally, that for each p 2 M we can ﬁnd
an open subset U Â M containing p, an open subset Uy Â Rn, and a homeomorphism ' W U ! Uy .
I Exercise 1.1. Show that equivalent deﬁnitions of manifolds are obtained if instead of allowing U to be homeomorphic to any open subset of Rn, we require it to be homeomorphic to an open ball in Rn, or to Rn itself.
If M is a topological manifold, we often abbreviate the dimension of M as dim M . Informally, one sometimes writes “Let M n be a manifold” as shorthand for “Let M be a manifold of dimension n.” The superscript n is not part of the name of the manifold, and is usually not included in the notation after the ﬁrst occurrence.
It is important to note that every topological manifold has, by deﬁnition, a speciﬁc, well-deﬁned dimension. Thus, we do not consider spaces of mixed dimension, such as the disjoint union of a plane and a line, to be manifolds at all. In Chapter 17, we will use the theory of de Rham cohomology to prove the following theorem, which shows that the dimension of a (nonempty) topological manifold is in fact a topological invariant.
Theorem 1.2 (Topological Invariance of Dimension). A nonempty n-dimensional topological manifold cannot be homeomorphic to an m-dimensional manifold unless m D n.
For the proof, see Theorem 17.26. In Chapter 2, we will also prove a related but weaker theorem (diffeomorphism invariance of dimension, Theorem 2.17). See also [LeeTM, Chap. 13] for a different proof of Theorem 1.2 using singular homology theory.
The empty set satisﬁes the deﬁnition of a topological n-manifold for every n. For the most part, we will ignore this special case (sometimes without remembering to say so). But because it is useful in certain contexts to allow the empty manifold, we choose not to exclude it from the deﬁnition.
The basic example of a topological n-manifold is Rn itself. It is Hausdorff because it is a metric space, and it is second-countable because the set of all open balls with rational centers and rational radii is a countable basis for its topology.
Requiring that manifolds share these properties helps to ensure that manifolds behave in the ways we expect from our experience with Euclidean spaces. For example, it is easy to verify that in a Hausdorff space, ﬁnite subsets are closed and limits of convergent sequences are unique (see Exercise A.11 in Appendix A). The motivation for second-countability is a bit less evident, but it will have important

consequences throughout the book, mostly based on the existence of partitions of unity (see Chapter 2).
In practice, both the Hausdorff and second-countability properties are usually easy to check, especially for spaces that are built out of other manifolds, because both properties are inherited by subspaces and ﬁnite products (Propositions A.17 and A.23). In particular, it follows that every open subset of a topological nmanifold is itself a topological n-manifold (with the subspace topology, of course).
We should note that some authors choose to omit the Hausdorff property or second-countability or both from the deﬁnition of manifolds. However, most of the interesting results about manifolds do in fact require these properties, and it is exceedingly rare to encounter a space “in nature” that would be a manifold except for the failure of one or the other of these hypotheses. For a couple of simple examples, see Problems 1-1 and 1-2; for a more involved example (a connected, locally Euclidean, Hausdorff space that is not second-countable), see [LeeTM, Problem 4-6].
Coordinate Charts
Let M be a topological n-manifold. A coordinate chart (or just a chart) on M is a pair .U; '/, where U is an open subset of M and ' W U ! Uy is a homeomorphism from U to an open subset Uy D '.U / Â Rn (Fig. 1.2). By deﬁnition of a topological manifold, each point p 2 M is contained in the domain of some chart .U; '/. If '.p/ D 0, we say that the chart is centered at p. If .U; '/ is any chart whose domain contains p, it is easy to obtain a new chart centered at p by subtracting the constant vector '.p/.
Given a chart .U; '/, we call the set U a coordinate domain, or a coordinate neighborhood of each of its points. If, in addition, '.U / is an open ball in Rn, then U is called a coordinate ball; if '.U / is an open cube, U is a coordinate cube. The map ' is called a (local) coordinate map, and the component functions x1; : : : ; xn of ', deﬁned by '.p/ D x1.p/; : : : ; xn.p/ , are called local coordinates on U . We sometimes write things such as “.U; '/ is a chart containing p” as shorthand for “.U; '/ is a chart whose domain U contains p.” If we wish to emphasize the

coordinate functions x1; : : : ; xn instead of the coordinate map ', we sometimes denote the chart by U; x1; : : : ; xn or U; xi .

Examples of Topological Manifolds

Here are some simple examples.

Example 1.3 (Graphs of Continuous Functions). Let U Â Rn be an open subset,

and let f W U ! Rk be a continuous function. The graph of f is the subset of

Rn Rk deﬁned by

with the subspace topology. Let 1 W Rn Rk ! Rn denote the projection onto the ﬁrst factor, and let ' W .f / ! U be the restriction of 1 to .f /:

'.x; y/ D x; .x; y/ 2 .f /:

Because ' is the restriction of a continuous map, it is continuous; and it is a homeomorphism because it has a continuous inverse given by ' 1.x/ D .x; f .x//. Thus

.f / is a topological manifold of dimension n. In fact, .f / is homeomorphic

to U itself, and ..f /; '/ is a global coordinate chart, called graph coordinates. The same observation applies to any subset of RnCk deﬁned by setting any k of

the coordinates (not necessarily the last k) equal to some continuous function of the

other n, which are restricted to lie in an open subset of Rn.

Example 1.4 (Spheres). For each integer n 0, the unit n-sphere Sn is Hausdorff

and second-countable because it is a topological subspace of RnC1. To show that

it is locally Euclidean, for each index i D 1; : : : ; n C 1 let UiC denote the subset of RnC1 where the i th coordinate is positive:

UiC D ˚ x1; : : : ; xnC1

(See Fig. 1.3.) Similarly, Ui is the set where xi < 0. Let f W Bn ! R be the continuous function p f .u/ D 1 juj2:

Then for each i D 1; : : : ; n C 1, it is easy to check that UiC \ Sn is the graph of the function
xi D f x1; : : : ; xbi ; : : : ; xnC1 ;

where the hat indicates that xi is omitted. Similarly, Ui \ Sn is the graph of

xi D f x1; : : : ; xbi ; : : : ; xnC1 :

Thus, each subset Ui˙ \ Sn is locally Euclidean of dimension n, and the maps 'i˙ W Ui˙ \ Sn ! Bn given by
'i˙ x1; : : : ; xnC1 D x1; : : : ; xbi ; : : : ; xnC1

Example 1.5 (Projective Spaces). The n-dimensional real projective space, de-

noted by RP n (or sometimes just P n), is deﬁned as the set of 1-dimensional lin-

ear subspaces of RnC1, with the quotient topology determined by the natural map

W RnC1 X f0g ! RP n sending each point x 2 RnC1 X f0g to the subspace spanned

by x. The 2-dimensional projective space RP 2 is called the projective plane. For

any point x 2 RnC1 X f0g, let Œx D .x/ 2 RP n denote the line spanned by x.

For each i D 1; : : : ; n C 1, let Uzi Â RnC1 X f0g be the set where xi ¤ 0, and let Ui D Uzi Â RP n. Since Uzi is a saturated open subset, Ui is open and

jUzi W Uzi ! Ui is a quotient map (see Theorem A.27). Deﬁne a map 'i W Ui ! Rn

by

D xi ;:::; xi ; xi ;:::; xi :

This map is well deﬁned because its value is unchanged by multiplying x by a nonzero constant. Because 'i ı is continuous, 'i is continuous by the characteristic property of quotient maps (Theorem A.27). In fact, 'i is a homeomorphism, because it has a continuous inverse given by

'i 1 u1; : : : ; un D u1; : : : ; ui 1; 1; ui ; : : : ; un ;

as you can check. Geometrically, '.Œx/ D u means .u; 1/ is the point in RnC1

where the line Œx intersects the afﬁne hyperplane where xi D 1 (Fig. 1.4). Because the sets U1; : : : ; UnC1 cover RP n, this shows that RP n is locally Eu-

clidean of dimension n. The Hausdorff and second-countability properties are left as

exercises.

folds of dimensions n1; : : : ; nk, respectively. The product space M1

Mk

is shown to be a topological manifold of dimension n1 C C nk as follows. It

is Hausdorff and second-countable by Propositions A.17 and A.23, so only the

locally Euclidean property needs to be checked. Given any point .p1; : : : ; pk/ 2

M1

Mk, we can choose a coordinate chart .Ui ; 'i / for each Mi with pi 2 Ui .

The product map

Thus, M1

Mk is a topological manifold of dimension n1 C C nk, with

charts of the form .U1

Example 1.9 (Tori). For a positive integer n, the n-torus (plural: tori) is the product

space T n D S1

S1. By the discussion above, it is a topological n-manifold.

(The 2-torus is usually called simply the torus.)

Topological Properties of Manifolds
As topological spaces go, manifolds are quite special, because they share so many important properties with Euclidean spaces. Here we discuss a few such properties that will be of use to us throughout the book.
Most of the properties we discuss in this section depend on the fact that every manifold possesses a particularly well-behaved basis for its topology.
Lemma 1.10. Every topological manifold has a countable basis of precompact coordinate balls.

8

1 Smooth Manifolds

Proof. Let M be a topological n-manifold. First we consider the special case in which M can be covered by a single chart. Suppose ' W M ! Uy Â Rn is a global coordinate map, and let B be the collection of all open balls Br .x/ Â Rn such that r is rational, x has rational coordinates, and Br0 .x/ Â Uy for some r0 > r . Each such ball is precompact in Uy , and it is easy to check that B is a countable basis for the topology of Uy . Because ' is a homeomorphism, it follows that the collection of sets of the form ' 1.B/ for B 2 B is a countable basis for the topology of M; consisting
of precompact coordinate balls, with the restrictions of ' as coordinate maps.
Now let M be an arbitrary n-manifold. By deﬁnition, each point of M is in
the domain of a chart. Because every open cover of a second-countable space has
a countable subcover (Proposition A.16), M is covered by countably many charts
f.Ui ; 'i /g. By the argument in the preceding paragraph, each coordinate domain Ui has a countable basis of coordinate balls that are precompact in Ui , and the union of all these countable bases is a countable basis for the topology of M. If V Â Ui is one of these balls, then the closure of V in Ui is compact, and because M is Hausdorff, it is closed in M . It follows that the closure of V in M is the same as its closure in
Ui , so V is precompact in M as well.

Connectivity
The existence of a basis of coordinate balls has important consequences for the connectivity properties of manifolds. Recall that a topological space X is
connected if there do not exist two disjoint, nonempty, open subsets of X whose union is X ; path-connected if every pair of points in X can be joined by a path in X ; and locally path-connected if X has a basis of path-connected open subsets.
(See Appendix A.) The following proposition shows that connectivity and path connectivity coincide for manifolds.
Proposition 1.11. Let M be a topological manifold.
(a) M is locally path-connected. (b) M is connected if and only if it is path-connected. (c) The components of M are the same as its path components. (d) M has countably many components, each of which is an open subset of M and
a connected topological manifold.
Proof. Since each coordinate ball is path-connected, (a) follows from the fact that M has a basis of coordinate balls. Parts (b) and (c) are immediate consequences of (a) and Proposition A.43. To prove (d), note that each component is open in M by Proposition A.43, so the collection of components is an open cover of M . Because M is second-countable, this cover must have a countable subcover. But since the components are all disjoint, the cover must have been countable to begin with, which is to say that M has only countably many components. Because the components are open, they are connected topological manifolds in the subspace topology.

Local Compactness and Paracompactness

The next topological property of manifolds that we need is local compactness (see Appendix A for the deﬁnition).

Proposition 1.12 (Manifolds Are Locally Compact). Every topological manifold is locally compact.

Proof. Lemma 1.10 showed that every manifold has a basis of precompact open subsets.

Another key topological property possessed by manifolds is called paracompactness. It is a consequence of local compactness and second-countability, and in fact is one of the main reasons why second-countability is included in the deﬁnition of manifolds.
Let M be a topological space. A collection X of subsets of M is said to be locally ﬁnite if each point of M has a neighborhood that intersects at most ﬁnitely many of the sets in X. Given a cover U of M; another cover V is called a reﬁnement of U if for each V 2 V there exists some U 2 U such that V Â U . We say that M is paracompact if every open cover of M admits an open, locally ﬁnite reﬁnement.

Lemma 1.13. Suppose X is a locally ﬁnite collection of subsets of a topological

space M .

I Exercise 1.14. Prove the preceding lemma.

Theorem 1.15 (Manifolds Are Paracompact). Every topological manifold is paracompact. In fact, given a topological manifold M; an open cover X of M; and any basis B for the topology of M; there exists a countable, locally ﬁnite open reﬁnement of X consisting of elements of B.
Proof. Given M; X, and B as in the hypothesis of the theorem, let .Kj /j1D1 be an exhaustion of M by compact sets (Proposition A.60). For each j , let Vj D Kj C1 X Int Kj and Wj D Int Kj C2 X Kj 1 (where we interpret Kj as ¿ if j < 1). Then Vj is a compact set contained in the open subset Wj . For each x 2 Vj , there is some Xx 2 X containing x, and because B is a basis, there exists Bx 2 B such that x 2 Bx Â Xx \ Wj . The collection of all such sets Bx as x ranges over Vj is an open cover of Vj , and thus has a ﬁnite subcover. The union of all such ﬁnite subcovers as j ranges over the positive integers is a countable open cover of M that reﬁnes X. Because the ﬁnite subcover of Vj consists of sets contained in Wj , and Wj \ Wj 0 D ¿ except when j 2 Ä j 0 Ä j C 2, the resulting cover is locally ﬁnite.

Problem 1-5 shows that, at least for connected spaces, paracompactness can be used as a substitute for second-countability in the deﬁnition of manifolds.

Fundamental Groups of Manifolds

The following result about fundamental groups of manifolds will be important in our study of covering manifolds in Chapter 4. For a brief review of the fundamental group, see Appendix A.

Proposition 1.16. The fundamental group of a topological manifold is countable.

Proof. Let M be a topological manifold. By Lemma 1.10, there is a countable
collection B of coordinate balls covering M . For any pair of coordinate balls B; B0 2 B, the intersection B \ B0 has at most countably many components, each
of which is path-connected. Let X be a countable set containing a point from each component of B \ B0 for each B; B0 2 B (including B D B0). For each B 2 B and each x; x0 2 X such that x; x0 2 B, let hBx;x0 be some path from x to x0 in B.
Since the fundamental groups based at any two points in the same component
of M are isomorphic, and X contains at least one point in each component of M;
we may as well choose a point p 2 X as base point. Deﬁne a special loop to be a loop based at p that is equal to a ﬁnite product of paths of the form hBx;x0 . Clearly, the set of special loops is countable, and each special loop determines an element
of 1.M; p/. To show that 1.M; p/ is countable, therefore, it sufﬁces to show that
each element of 1.M; p/ is represented by a special loop. Suppose f W Œ0; 1 ! M is a loop based at p. The collection of components of
sets of the form f 1.B/ as B ranges over B is an open cover of Œ0; 1, so by
compactness it has a ﬁnite subcover. Thus, there are ﬁnitely many numbers 0 D a0 < a1 < < ak D 1 such that Œai 1; ai  Â f 1.B/ for some B Â B. For each i , let fi be the restriction of f to the interval Œai 1; ai , reparametrized so that its domain is Œ0; 1, and let Bi 2 B be a coordinate ball containing the image of fi . For each i , we have f .ai / 2 Bi \ BiC1, and there is some xi 2 X that lies in the same component of Bi \ BiC1 as f .ai /. Let gi be a path in Bi \ BiC1 from xi to f .ai / (Fig. 1.5), with the understanding that x0 D xk D p, and g0 and gk are both equal to the constant path cp based at p. Then, because gxi gi is path-homotopic to a constant path (where gxi .t / D gi .1 t / is the reverse path of gi ),

homotopic to a special loop, as claimed.

Smooth Structures
The deﬁnition of manifolds that we gave in the preceding section is sufﬁcient for studying topological properties of manifolds, such as compactness, connectedness,

Fig. 1.5 The fundamental group of a manifold is countable
simple connectivity, and the problem of classifying manifolds up to homeomorphism. However, in the entire theory of topological manifolds there is no mention of calculus. There is a good reason for this: however we might try to make sense of derivatives of functions on a manifold, such derivatives cannot be invariant under homeomorphisms. For example, the map ' W R2 ! R2 given by '.u; v/ D u1=3; v1=3 is a homeomorphism, and it is easy to construct differentiable functions f W R2 ! R such that f ı ' is not differentiable at the origin. (The function f .x; y/ D x is one such.)
To make sense of derivatives of real-valued functions, curves, or maps between manifolds, we need to introduce a new kind of manifold called a smooth manifold. It will be a topological manifold with some extra structure in addition to its topology, which will allow us to decide which functions to or from the manifold are smooth.
The deﬁnition will be based on the calculus of maps between Euclidean spaces, so let us begin by reviewing some basic terminology about such maps. If U and V are open subsets of Euclidean spaces Rn and Rm, respectively, a function F W U ! V is said to be smooth (or C 1, or inﬁnitely differentiable) if each of its component functions has continuous partial derivatives of all orders. If in addition F is bijective and has a smooth inverse map, it is called a diffeomorphism. A diffeomorphism is, in particular, a homeomorphism.
A review of some important properties of smooth maps is given in Appendix C. You should be aware that some authors deﬁne the word smooth differently—for example, to mean continuously differentiable or merely differentiable. On the other hand, some use the word differentiable to mean what we call smooth. Throughout this book, smooth is synonymous with C 1.
To see what additional structure on a topological manifold might be appropriate for discerning which maps are smooth, consider an arbitrary topological n-manifold M . Each point in M is in the domain of a coordinate map ' W U ! Uy Â Rn.

12

1 Smooth Manifolds

Fig. 1.6 A transition map
A plausible deﬁnition of a smooth function on M would be to say that f W M ! R is smooth if and only if the composite function f ı' 1 W Uy ! R is smooth in the sense of ordinary calculus. But this will make sense only if this property is independent of the choice of coordinate chart. To guarantee this independence, we will restrict our attention to “smooth charts.” Since smoothness is not a homeomorphism-invariant property, the way to do this is to consider the collection of all smooth charts as a new kind of structure on M .
With this motivation in mind, we now describe the details of the construction. Let M be a topological n-manifold. If .U; '/, .V; / are two charts such that U \ V ¤ ¿, the composite map ı ' 1 W '.U \ V / ! .U \ V / is called the transition map from ' to (Fig. 1.6). It is a composition of homeomorphisms, and is therefore itself a homeomorphism. Two charts .U; '/ and .V; / are said to be smoothly compatible if either U \ V D ¿ or the transition map ı ' 1 is a diffeomorphism. Since '.U \ V / and .U \ V / are open subsets of Rn, smoothness of this map is to be interpreted in the ordinary sense of having continuous partial derivatives of all orders. We deﬁne an atlas for M to be a collection of charts whose domains cover M . An atlas A is called a smooth atlas if any two charts in A are smoothly compatible with each other. To show that an atlas is smooth, we need only verify that each transition map ı ' 1 is smooth whenever .U; '/ and .V; / are charts in A; once we have proved this, it follows that ı ' 1 is a diffeomorphism because its inverse ı ' 1 1 D ' ı 1 is one of the transition maps we have already shown to be smooth. Alternatively, given two particular charts .U; '/ and .V; /, it is often easiest to show that

Smooth Structures

13

they are smoothly compatible by verifying that ı ' 1 is smooth and injective with

nonsingular Jacobian at each point, and appealing to Corollary C.36.

Our plan is to deﬁne a “smooth structure” on M by giving a smooth atlas, and to

deﬁne a function f W M ! R to be smooth if and only if f ı ' 1 is smooth in the

sense of ordinary calculus for each coordinate chart .U; '/ in the atlas. There is one

minor technical problem with this approach: in general, there will be many possible

atlases that give the “same” smooth structure, in that they all determine the same

collection of smooth functions on M . For example, consider the following pair of

atlases on Rn:

A1

˚ D

Rn; IdRn

« ;

˚ A2 D B1.x/; IdB1.x/

W x 2 Rn« :

Although these are different smooth atlases, clearly a function f W Rn ! R is smooth with respect to either atlas if and only if it is smooth in the sense of ordinary calculus.
We could choose to deﬁne a smooth structure as an equivalence class of smooth atlases under an appropriate equivalence relation. However, it is more straightforward to make the following deﬁnition: a smooth atlas A on M is maximal if it is not properly contained in any larger smooth atlas. This just means that any chart that is smoothly compatible with every chart in A is already in A. (Such a smooth atlas is also said to be complete.)
Now we can deﬁne the main concept of this chapter. If M is a topological manifold, a smooth structure on M is a maximal smooth atlas. A smooth manifold is a pair .M; A/, where M is a topological manifold and A is a smooth structure on M . When the smooth structure is understood, we usually omit mention of it and just say “M is a smooth manifold.” Smooth structures are also called differentiable structures or C 1 structures by some authors. We also use the term smooth manifold structure to mean a manifold topology together with a smooth structure.
We emphasize that a smooth structure is an additional piece of data that must be added to a topological manifold before we are entitled to talk about a “smooth manifold.” In fact, a given topological manifold may have many different smooth structures (see Example 1.23 and Problem 1-6). On the other hand, it is not always possible to ﬁnd a smooth structure on a given topological manifold: there exist topological manifolds that admit no smooth structures at all. (The ﬁrst example was a compact 10-dimensional manifold found in 1960 by Michel Kervaire [Ker60].)
It is generally not very convenient to deﬁne a smooth structure by explicitly describing a maximal smooth atlas, because such an atlas contains very many charts. Fortunately, we need only specify some smooth atlas, as the next proposition shows.

Proposition 1.17. Let M be a topological manifold.

(a) Every smooth atlas A for M is contained in a unique maximal smooth atlas, called the smooth structure determined by A.
(b) Two smooth atlases for M determine the same smooth structure if and only if their union is a smooth atlas.

14

1 Smooth Manifolds

Fig. 1.7 Proof of Proposition 1.17(a)
Proof. Let A be a smooth atlas for M; and let AS denote the set of all charts that are smoothly compatible with every chart in A. To show that AS is a smooth atlas, we need to show that any two charts of AS are smoothly compatible with each other, which is to say that for any .U; '/, .V; / 2 AS, the map ı ' 1 W '.U \ V / !
.U \ V / is smooth. Let x D '.p/ 2 '.U \ V / be arbitrary. Because the domains of the charts in A cover M; there is some chart .W; Â / 2 A such that p 2 W (Fig. 1.7). Since every chart in AS is smoothly compatible with .W; Â /, both of the maps Â ı' 1 and ıÂ 1 are smooth where they are deﬁned. Since p 2 U \ V \ W , it follows that ı ' 1 D ı Â 1 ı Â ı ' 1 is smooth on a neighborhood of x. Thus, ı ' 1 is smooth in a neighborhood of each point in '.U \ V /. Therefore, AS is a smooth atlas. To check that it is maximal, just note that any chart that is smoothly compatible with every chart in AS must in particular be smoothly compatible with every chart in A, so it is already in AS. This proves the existence of a maximal smooth atlas containing A. If B is any other maximal smooth atlas containing A, each of its charts is smoothly compatible with each chart in A, so B Â AS. By maximality of B, B D AS. The proof of (b) is left as an exercise.
I Exercise 1.18. Prove Proposition 1.17(b).
For example, if a topological manifold M can be covered by a single chart, the smooth compatibility condition is trivially satisﬁed, so any such chart automatically determines a smooth structure on M .
It is worth mentioning that the notion of smooth structure can be generalized in several different ways by changing the compatibility requirement for charts. For example, if we replace the requirement that charts be smoothly compatible by the weaker requirement that each transition map ı ' 1 (and its inverse) be of

Smooth Structures

15

class C k, we obtain the deﬁnition of a C k structure. Similarly, if we require that
each transition map be real-analytic (i.e., expressible as a convergent power series in
a neighborhood of each point), we obtain the deﬁnition of a real-analytic structure, also called a C ! structure. If M has even dimension n D 2m, we can identify R2m with Cm and require that the transition maps be complex-analytic; this determines
a complex-analytic structure. A manifold endowed with one of these structures is called a C k manifold, real-analytic manifold, or complex manifold, respectively. (Note that a C 0 manifold is just a topological manifold.) We do not treat any of these
other kinds of manifolds in this book, but they play important roles in analysis, so it
is useful to know the deﬁnitions.

Local Coordinate Representations
If M is a smooth manifold, any chart .U; '/ contained in the given maximal smooth atlas is called a smooth chart, and the corresponding coordinate map ' is called a smooth coordinate map. It is useful also to introduce the terms smooth coordinate domain or smooth coordinate neighborhood for the domain of a smooth coordinate chart. A smooth coordinate ball means a smooth coordinate domain whose image under a smooth coordinate map is a ball in Euclidean space. A smooth coordinate cube is deﬁned similarly.
It is often useful to restrict attention to coordinate balls whose closures sit nicely inside larger coordinate balls. We say a set B Â M is a regular coordinate ball if there is a smooth coordinate ball B0 Ã Bx and a smooth coordinate map ' W B0 ! Rn such that for some positive real numbers r < r0,
'.B/ D Br .0/; ' Bx D Bxr .0/; and ' B0 D Br0 .0/:
Because Bx is homeomorphic to Bxr .0/, it is compact, and thus every regular coordinate ball is precompact in M . The next proposition gives a slight improvement on Lemma 1.10 for smooth manifolds. Its proof is a straightforward adaptation of the proof of that lemma.
Proposition 1.19. Every smooth manifold has a countable basis of regular coordinate balls.
I Exercise 1.20. Prove Proposition 1.19.
Here is how one usually thinks about coordinate charts on a smooth manifold. Once we choose a smooth chart .U; '/ on M; the coordinate map ' W U ! Uy Â Rn can be thought of as giving a temporary identiﬁcation between U and Uy . Using this identiﬁcation, while we work in this chart, we can think of U simultaneously as an open subset of M and as an open subset of Rn. You can visualize this identiﬁcation by thinking of a “grid” drawn on U representing the preimages of the coordinate lines under ' (Fig. 1.8). Under this identiﬁcation, we can represent a point p 2 U by its coordinates x1; : : : ; xn D '.p/, and think of this n-tuple as being the

16

1 Smooth Manifolds

Fig. 1.8 A coordinate grid
point p. We typically express this by saying “ x1; : : : ; xn is the (local) coordinate representation for p” or “p D x1; : : : ; xn in local coordinates.”
Another way to look at it is that by means of our identiﬁcation U $ Uy , we can think of ' as the identity map and suppress it from the notation. This takes a bit of getting used to, but the payoff is a huge simpliﬁcation of the notation in many situations. You just need to remember that the identiﬁcation is in general only local, and depends heavily on the choice of coordinate chart.
You are probably already used to such identiﬁcations from your study of multivariable calculus. The most common example is polar coordinates .r; Â / in the plane, deﬁned implicitly by the relation .x; y/ D .r cos Â; r sin Â / (see Example C.37). On an appropriate open subset such as U D f.x; y/ W x > 0g Â R2, .r; Â / can be expressed as smooth functions of .x; y/, and the map that sends .x; y/ to the corresponding .r; Â / is a smooth coordinate map with respect to the standard smooth structure on R2. Using this map, we can write a given point p 2 U either as p D .x; y/ in standard coordinates or as p D .r; Â / in ppolar coordinates, where the two coordinate representations are related by .r; Â / D x2 C y2; tan 1 y=x and .x; y/ D .r cos Â; r sin Â /. Other polar coordinate charts can be obtained by restricting .r; Â / to other open subsets of R2 X f0g.
The fact that manifolds do not come with any predetermined choice of coordinates is both a blessing and a curse. The ﬂexibility to choose coordinates more or less arbitrarily can be a big advantage in approaching problems in manifold theory, because the coordinates can often be chosen to simplify some aspect of the problem at hand. But we pay for this ﬂexibility by being obliged to ensure that any objects we wish to deﬁne globally on a manifold are not dependent on a particular choice of coordinates. There are generally two ways of doing this: either by writing down a coordinate-dependent deﬁnition and then proving that the deﬁnition gives the same results in any coordinate chart, or by writing down a deﬁnition that is manifestly coordinate-independent (often called an invariant deﬁnition). We will use the coordinate-dependent approach in a few circumstances where it is notably simpler, but for the most part we will give coordinate-free deﬁnitions whenever possible. The need for such deﬁnitions accounts for much of the abstraction of modern manifold theory. One of the most important skills you will need to acquire in order to use manifold theory effectively is an ability to switch back and forth easily between invariant descriptions and their coordinate counterparts.

Examples of Smooth Manifolds

Examples of Smooth Manifolds

Before proceeding further with the general theory, let us survey some examples of smooth manifolds.

Example 1.21 (0-Dimensional Manifolds). A topological manifold M of dimen-

sion 0 is just a countable discrete space. For each point p 2 M; the only neighbor-

hood of p that is homeomorphic to an open subset of R0 is fpg itself, and there is

exactly one coordinate map ' W fpg ! R0. Thus, the set of all charts on M trivially

satisﬁes the smooth compatibility condition, and each 0-dimensional manifold has

a unique smooth structure.

//

Example 1.22 (Euclidean Spaces). For each nonnegative integer n, the Euclidean

space Rn is a smooth n-manifold with the smooth structure determined by the atlas

consisting of the single chart .Rn; IdRn /. We call this the standard smooth structure on Rn and the resulting coordinate map standard coordinates. Unless we explic-

itly specify otherwise, we always use this smooth structure on Rn. With respect to

this smooth structure, the smooth coordinate charts for Rn are exactly those charts

.U; '/ such that ' is a diffeomorphism (in the sense of ordinary calculus) from U

to another open subset Uy Â Rn.

//

Example 1.23 (Another Smooth Structure on R). Consider the homeomorphism W R ! R given by

.x/ D x3:

(1.1)

The atlas consisting of the single chart .R; / deﬁnes a smooth structure on R.

This chart is not smoothly compatible with the standard smooth structure, because

the transition map IdR ı 1.y/ D y1=3 is not smooth at the origin. Therefore, the

smooth structure deﬁned on R by is not the same as the standard one. Using

similar ideas, it is not hard to construct many distinct smooth structures on any given

positive-dimensional topological manifold, as long as it has one smooth structure to

begin with (see Problem 1-6).

//

Example 1.24 (Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces). Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional real vector space. Any norm on V determines a topology, which is independent of the choice of norm (Exercise B.49). With this topology, V is a topological nmanifold, and has a natural smooth structure deﬁned as follows. Each (ordered) basis .E1; : : : ; En/ for V deﬁnes a basis isomorphism E W Rn ! V by

The collection of all such charts thus deﬁnes a smooth structure, called the standard

//

The Einstein Summation Convention

This is a good place to pause and introduce an important notational convention that

is of

csoummmmoatniloynsusseudchinasthPe si txuidEyioifnstmhiosostuhbmjeacnt,ifwoeldosf.tBenecaabubsreevoifattehesupcrholaifseurmatiobny

omitting the summation sign, as in

Xn E.x/ D xi Ei ; an abbreviation for E.x/ D xi Ei :
i D1

We interpret any such expression according to the following rule, called the Einstein summation convention: if the same index name (such as i in the expression above) appears exactly twice in any monomial term, once as an upper index and once as a lower index, that term is understood to be summed over all possible values of that index, generally from 1 to the dimension of the space in question. This simple idea was introduced by Einstein to reduce the complexity of expressions arising in the study of smooth manifolds by eliminating the necessity of explicitly writing summation signs. We use the summation convention systematically throughout the book (except in the appendices, which many readers will look at before the rest of the book).
Another important aspect of the summation convention is the positions of the indices. We always write basis vectors (such as Ei ) with lower indices, and components of a vector with respect to a basis (such as xi ) with upper indices. These index conventions help to ensure that, in summations that make mathematical sense, each index to be summed over typically appears twice in any given term, once as a lower index and once as an upper index. Any index that is implicitly summed over is a “dummy index,” meaning that the value of such an expression is unchanged if a different name is substituted for each dummy index. For example, xi Ei and xj Ej mean exactly the same thing.
Since the coordinates of a point x1; : : : ; xn 2 Rn are also its components with respect to the standard basis, in order to be consistent with our convention of writing components of vectors with upper indices, we need to use upper indices for these coordinates, and we do so throughout this book. Although this may seem awkward at ﬁrst, in combination with the summation convention it offers enormous advantages

when we work with complicated indexed sums, not the least of which is that expres-

sions that are not mathematically meaningful often betray themselves quickly by

violating the index convention. Euclidean dot product x y D

in Chapter 22. We always explicitly write summation signs in such expressions.)

More Examples

Now we continue with our examples of smooth manifolds.

Example 1.25 (Spaces of Matrices). Let M.m n; R/ denote the set of m n

matrices with real entries. Because it is a real vector space of dimension mn under

matrix addition and scalar multiplication, M.m n; R/ is a smooth mn-dimensional

manifold. (In fact, it is often useful to identify M.m n; R/ with Rmn, just by

stringing all the matrix entries out in a single row.) Similarly, the space M.m n; C/

of m n complex matrices is a vector space of dimension 2mn over R, and thus

a smooth manifold of dimension 2mn. In the special case in which m D n (square

matrices), we abbreviate M.n n; R/ and M.n n; C/ by M.n; R/ and M.n; C/,

respectively.

//

Example 1.26 (Open Submanifolds). Let U be any open subset of Rn. Then U is

a topological n-manifold, and the single chart .U; IdU / deﬁnes a smooth structure

on U .

More generally, let M be a smooth n-manifold and let U Â M be any open

subset. Deﬁne an atlas on U by

˚

«

AU D smooth charts .V; '/ for M such that V Â U :

Every point p 2 U is contained in the domain of some chart .W; '/ for M ; if we set

V D W \ U , then .V; 'jV / is a chart in AU whose domain contains p. Therefore,

U is covered by the domains of charts in AU , and it is easy to verify that this is

a smooth atlas for U . Thus any open subset of M is itself a smooth n-manifold

in a natural way. Endowed with this smooth structure, we call any open subset an

open submanifold of M . (We will deﬁne a more general class of submanifolds in

Chapter 5.)

//

Example 1.27 (The General Linear Group). The general linear group GL.n; R/

is the set of invertible n n matrices with real entries. It is a smooth n2-dimensional manifold because it is an open subset of the n2-dimensional vector space M.n; R/,

namely the set where the (continuous) determinant function is nonzero.

//

Example 1.28 (Matrices of Full Rank). The previous example has a natural generalization to rectangular matrices of full rank. Suppose m < n, and let Mm.m n; R/ denote the subset of M.m n; R/ consisting of matrices of rank m. If A is an arbitrary such matrix, the fact that rank A D m means that A has some nonsingular m m submatrix. By continuity of the determinant function, this same submatrix

20

1 Smooth Manifolds

has nonzero determinant on a neighborhood of A in M.m n; R/, which implies

that A has a neighborhood contained in Mm.m n; R/. Thus, Mm.m n; R/ is an

open subset of M.m n; R/, and therefore is itself a smooth mn-dimensional man-

ifold. A similar argument shows that Mn.m n; R/ is a smooth mn-manifold when

n < m.

//

Example 1.29 (Spaces of Linear Maps). Suppose V and W are ﬁnite-dimensional

real vector spaces, and let L.V I W / denote the set of linear maps from V to W . Then

because L.V I W / is itself a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space (whose dimension is the

product of the dimensions of V and W ), it has a natural smooth manifold structure

as in Example 1.24. One way to put global coordinates on it is to choose bases for V

and W , and represent each T 2 L.V I W / by its matrix, which yields an isomorphism

of L.V I W / with M.m n; R/ for m D dim W and n D dim V .

//

Example 1.30 (Graphs of Smooth Functions). If U Â Rn is an open subset and

f W U ! Rk is a smooth function, we have already observed above (Example 1.3)

that the graph of f is a topological n-manifold in the subspace topology. Since

.f / is covered by the single graph coordinate chart ' W .f / ! U (the restriction

of 1), we can put a canonical smooth structure on .f / by declaring the graph

coordinate chart ..f /; '/ to be a smooth chart.

Example 1.31 (Spheres). We showed in Example 1.4 that the n-sphere Sn Â RnC1

is a topological n-manifold. We put a smooth structure on Sn as follows. For each

easily computed. In the case i < j , we get

Example 1.32 (Level Sets). The preceding example can be generalized as fol-

lows. Suppose U Â Rn is an open subset and ˚ W U ! R is a smooth function.

For any c 2 R, the set ˚ 1.c/ is called a level set of ˚. Choose some c 2 R, let

M D ˚ 1.c/, and suppose it happens that the total derivative D˚.a/ is nonzero

for each a 2 ˚ 1.c/. Because D˚.a/ is a row matrix whose entries are the partial

graph coordinate charts associated with a choice of f as above is a smooth chart.

In Chapter 5, we will develop the theory of smooth submanifolds, which is a far-

reaching generalization of this construction.

smooth manifold structure on the n-torus T n D S1

S1.

//

In each of the examples we have seen so far, we constructed a smooth manifold structure in two stages: we started with a topological space and checked that it was a topological manifold, and then we speciﬁed a smooth structure. It is often more convenient to combine these two steps into a single construction, especially if we start with a set that is not already equipped with a topology. The following lemma provides a shortcut—it shows how, given a set with suitable “charts” that overlap smoothly, we can use the charts to deﬁne both a topology and a smooth structure on the set.

Lemma 1.35 (Smooth Manifold Chart Lemma). Let M be a set, and suppose we are given a collection fU˛g of subsets of M together with maps '˛ W U˛ ! Rn, such that the following properties are satisﬁed:
(i) For each ˛, '˛ is a bijection between U˛ and an open subset '˛.U˛/ Â Rn. (ii) For each ˛ and ˇ, the sets '˛.U˛ \ Uˇ / and 'ˇ .U˛ \ Uˇ / are open in Rn. (iii) Whenever U˛ \ Uˇ ¤ ¿, the map 'ˇ ı '˛ 1 W '˛.U˛ \ Uˇ / ! 'ˇ .U˛ \ Uˇ / is
smooth. (iv) Countably many of the sets U˛ cover M . (v) Whenever p; q are distinct points in M; either there exists some U˛ containing
both p and q or there exist disjoint sets U˛; Uˇ with p 2 U˛ and q 2 Uˇ .
Then M has a unique smooth manifold structure such that each .U˛; '˛/ is a smooth chart.

Proof. We deﬁne the topology by taking all sets of the form '˛ 1.V /, with V an open subset of Rn, as a basis. To prove that this is a basis for a topology, we need to show that for any point p in the intersection of two basis sets '˛ 1.V / and 'ˇ 1.W /, there is a third basis set containing p and contained in the intersection. It sufﬁces to show that '˛ 1.V / \ 'ˇ 1.W / is itself a basis set (Fig. 1.9). To see this, observe that (iii) implies that 'ˇ ı '˛ 1 1.W / is an open subset of '˛.U˛ \ Uˇ /, and (ii) implies that this set is also open in Rn. It follows that
'˛ 1.V / \ 'ˇ 1.W / D '˛ 1 V \ 'ˇ ı '˛ 1 1.W /
is also a basis set, as claimed. Each map '˛ is then a homeomorphism onto its image (essentially by deﬁnition),
so M is locally Euclidean of dimension n. The Hausdorff property follows easily from (v), and second-countability follows from (iv) and the result of Exercise A.22, because each U˛ is second-countable. Finally, (iii) guarantees that the collection f.U˛; '˛/g is a smooth atlas. It is clear that this topology and smooth structure are the unique ones satisfying the conclusions of the lemma.
Example 1.36 (Grassmann Manifolds). Let V be an n-dimensional real vector space. For any integer 0 Ä k Ä n, we let Gk.V / denote the set of all k-dimensional linear subspaces of V . We will show that Gk.V / can be naturally given the structure of a smooth manifold of dimension k.n k/. With this structure, it is called a Grassmann manifold, or simply a Grassmannian. In the special case V D Rn, the Grassmannian Gk Rn is often denoted by some simpler notation such as Gk;n or G.k; n/. Note that G1 RnC1 is exactly the n-dimensional projective space RP n.

Examples of Smooth Manifolds

The construction of a smooth structure on Gk.V / is somewhat more involved than the ones we have done so far, but the basic idea is just to use linear algebra to construct charts for Gk.V /, and then apply the smooth manifold chart lemma. We will give a shorter proof that Gk.V / is a smooth manifold in Chapter 21 (see Example 21.21).
Let P and Q be any complementary subspaces of V of dimensions k and n k, respectively, so that V decomposes as a direct sum: V D P ˚ Q. The graph of any linear map X W P ! Q can be identiﬁed with a k-dimensional subspace .X/ Â V , deﬁned by
.X/ D fv C Xv W v 2 P g:
Any such subspace has the property that its intersection with Q is the zero subspace. Conversely, any subspace S Â V that intersects Q trivially is the graph of a unique linear map X W P ! Q, which can be constructed as follows: let P W V ! P and Q W V ! Q be the projections determined by the direct sum decomposition; then the hypothesis implies that P jS is an isomorphism from S to P . Therefore, X D . QjS / ı . P jS / 1 is a well-deﬁned linear map from P to Q, and it is straightforward to check that S is its graph.
Let L.P I Q/ denote the vector space of linear maps from P to Q, and let UQ denote the subset of Gk.V / consisting of k-dimensional subspaces whose intersections with Q are trivial. The assignment X 7! .X/ deﬁnes a map  W L.P I Q/ ! UQ, and the discussion above shows that  is a bijection. Let ' D  1 W UQ ! L.P I Q/. By choosing bases for P and Q, we can identify L.P I Q/ with M..n k/ k; R/ and hence with Rk.n k/, and thus we can think of .UQ; '/ as a coordinate chart. Since the image of each such chart is all of L.P I Q/, condition (i) of Lemma 1.35 is clearly satisﬁed.
Now let .P 0; Q0/ be any other such pair of subspaces, and let P 0 , Q0 be the corresponding projections and '0 W UQ0 ! L.P 0I Q0/ the corresponding map. The set '.UQ \ UQ0 / Â L.P I Q/ consists of all linear maps X W P ! Q whose graphs intersect Q0 trivially. To see that this set is open in L.P I Q/, for each X 2 L.P I Q/, let IX W P ! V be the map IX .v/ D v C Xv, which is a bijection from P to the graph of X . Because .X / D Im IX and Q0 D Ker P 0 , it follows from Exercise B.22(d) that the graph of X intersects Q0 trivially if and only if P 0 ı IX has full rank. Because the matrix entries of P 0 ı IX (with respect to any bases) depend continuously on X , the result of Example 1.28 shows that the set of all such X is open in L.P I Q/. Thus property (ii) in the smooth manifold chart lemma holds.
We need to show that the transition map '0 ı ' 1 is smooth on '.UQ \ UQ0 /. Suppose X 2 '.UQ \ UQ0 / Â L.P I Q/ is arbitrary, and let S denote the subspace .X / Â V . If we put X 0 D '0 ı ' 1.X /, then as above, X 0 D . Q0 jS / ı . P 0 jS / 1 (see Fig. 1.10). To relate this map to X , note that IX W P ! S is an isomorphism, so we can write
X 0 D . Q0 jS / ı IX ı .IX / 1 ı . P 0 jS / 1 D . Q0 ı IX / ı . P 0 ı IX / 1:

To show that this depends smoothly on X , deﬁne linear maps AW P ! P 0,

Then for v 2 P , we have

. P 0 ı IX /v D .A C CX /v; . Q0 ı IX /v D .B C DX /v;

from which it follows that X0 D .B C DX /.A C CX / 1. Once we choose bases for P , Q, P 0, and Q0, all of these linear maps are represented by matrices. Because the matrix entries of .A C CX/ 1 are rational functions of those of A C CX by Cramer’s rule, it follows that the matrix entries of X0 depend smoothly on those of X . This proves that '0 ı ' 1 is a smooth map, so the charts we have constructed

satisfy condition (iii) of Lemma 1.35.

To check condition (iv), we just note that Gk.V / can in fact be covered by ﬁnitely

many of the sets UQ: for example, if .E1; : : : ; En/ is any ﬁxed basis for V , any

partition of the basis elements into two subsets containing k and n k elements

determines appropriate subspaces P and Q, and any subspace S must have trivial

intersection with Q for at least one of these partitions (see Exercise B.9). Thus,

Gk.V / is covered by the ﬁnitely many charts determined by all possible partitions of a ﬁxed basis.

Finally, the Hausdorff condition (v) is easily veriﬁed by noting that for any two kdimensional subspaces P; P 0 Â V , it is possible to ﬁnd a subspace Q of dimension n k whose intersections with both P and P 0 are trivial, and then P and P 0 are

both contained in the domain of the chart determined by, say, .P; Q/.

Manifolds with Boundary
In many important applications of manifolds, most notably those involving integration, we will encounter spaces that would be smooth manifolds except that they

Manifolds with Boundary

25

Fig. 1.11 A manifold with boundary

have a “boundary” of some sort. Simple examples of such spaces include closed

intervals in R, closed balls in Rn, and closed hemispheres in Sn. To accommodate

such spaces, we need to extend our deﬁnition of manifolds.

Points in these spaces will have neighborhoods modeled either on open subsets of Rn or on open subsets of the closed n-dimensional upper half-space Hn Â Rn,

deﬁned as

Hn D ˚ x1; : : : ; xn 2 Rn W xn

« 0:

We will use the notations Int Hn and @Hn to denote the interior and boundary of Hn,

respectively, as a subset of Rn. When n > 0, this means

« 2 Rn W xn > 0 ;

In the n D 0 case, H0 D R0 D f0g, so Int H0 D R0 and @H0 D ¿.
An n-dimensional topological manifold with boundary is a second-countable
Hausdorff space M in which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic either to an open subset of Rn or to a (relatively) open subset of Hn (Fig. 1.11). An open subset U Â M together with a map ' W U ! Rn that is a homeomorphism onto an open subset of Rn or Hn will be called a chart for M , just as in the case of man-
ifolds. When it is necessary to make the distinction, we will call .U; '/ an interior chart if '.U / is an open subset of Rn (which includes the case of an open subset of Hn that does not intersect @Hn), and a boundary chart if '.U / is an open subset of Hn such that '.U / \ @Hn ¤ ¿. A boundary chart whose image is a set of the form Br .x/ \ Hn for some x 2 @Hn and r > 0 is called a coordinate half-ball.
A point p 2 M is called an interior point of M if it is in the domain of some
interior chart. It is a boundary point of M if it is in the domain of a boundary chart that sends p to @Hn. The boundary of M (the set of all its boundary points) is
denoted by @M ; similarly, its interior, the set of all its interior points, is denoted by
Int M .
It follows from the deﬁnition that each point p 2 M is either an interior point or a
boundary point: if p is not a boundary point, then either it is in the domain of an interior chart or it is in the domain of a boundary chart .U; '/ such that '.p/ … @Hn,

26

in which case the restriction of ' to U \ ' 1 Int Hn is an interior chart whose domain contains p. However, it is not obvious that a given point cannot be simultaneously an interior point with respect to one chart and a boundary point with respect to another. In fact, this cannot happen, but the proof requires more machinery than we have available at this point. For convenience, we state the theorem here.
Theorem 1.37 (Topological Invariance of the Boundary). If M is a topological manifold with boundary, then each point of M is either a boundary point or an interior point, but not both. Thus @M and Int M are disjoint sets whose union is M .
For the proof, see Problem 17-9. Later in this chapter, we will prove a weaker version of this result for smooth manifolds with boundary (Theorem 1.46), which will be sufﬁcient for most of our purposes.
Be careful to observe the distinction between these new deﬁnitions of the terms boundary and interior and their usage to refer to the boundary and interior of a subset of a topological space. A manifold with boundary may have nonempty boundary in this new sense, irrespective of whether it has a boundary as a subset of some other topological space. If we need to emphasize the difference between the two notions of boundary, we will use the terms topological boundary and manifold boundary as appropriate. For example, the closed unit ball Bxn is a manifold with boundary (see Problem 1-11), whose manifold boundary is Sn 1. Its topological boundary as a subset of Rn happens to be the sphere as well. However, if we think of Bxn as a topological space in its own right, then as a subset of itself, it has empty topological boundary. And if we think of it as a subset of RnC1 (considering Rn as a subset of RnC1 in the obvious way), its topological boundary is all of Bxn. Note that Hn is itself a manifold with boundary, and its manifold boundary is the same as its topological boundary as a subset of Rn. Every interval in R is a 1-manifold with boundary, whose manifold boundary consists of its endpoints (if any).
The nomenclature for manifolds with boundary is traditional and well established, but it must be used with care. Despite their name, manifolds with boundary are not in general manifolds, because boundary points do not have locally Euclidean neighborhoods. (This is a consequence of the theorem on invariance of the boundary.) Moreover, a manifold with boundary might have empty boundary—there is nothing in the deﬁnition that requires the boundary to be a nonempty set. On the other hand, a manifold is also a manifold with boundary, whose boundary is empty. Thus, every manifold is a manifold with boundary, but a manifold with boundary is a manifold if and only if its boundary is empty (see Proposition 1.38 below).
Even though the term manifold with boundary encompasses manifolds as well, we will often use redundant phrases such as manifold without boundary if we wish to emphasize that we are talking about a manifold in the original sense, and manifold with or without boundary to refer to a manifold with boundary if we wish emphasize that the boundary might be empty. (The latter phrase will often appear when our primary interest is in manifolds, but the results being discussed are just as easy to state and prove in the more general case of manifolds with boundary.) Note that the word “manifold” without further qualiﬁcation always means a manifold

without boundary. In the literature, you will also encounter the terms closed manifold to mean a compact manifold without boundary, and open manifold to mean a noncompact manifold without boundary.
Proposition 1.38. Let M be a topological n-manifold with boundary.
(a) Int M is an open subset of M and a topological n-manifold without boundary. (b) @M is a closed subset of M and a topological .n 1/-manifold without
boundary. (c) M is a topological manifold if and only if @M D ¿. (d) If n D 0, then @M D ¿ and M is a 0-manifold.
I Exercise 1.39. Prove the preceding proposition. For this proof, you may use the theorem on topological invariance of the boundary when necessary. Which parts require it?
The topological properties of manifolds that we proved earlier in the chapter have natural extensions to manifolds with boundary, with essentially the same proofs as in the manifold case. For the record, we state them here.
Proposition 1.40. Let M be a topological manifold with boundary.
(a) M has a countable basis of precompact coordinate balls and half-balls. (b) M is locally compact. (c) M is paracompact. (d) M is locally path-connected. (e) M has countably many components, each of which is an open subset of M and
a connected topological manifold with boundary. (f) The fundamental group of M is countable.
I Exercise 1.41. Prove the preceding proposition.

Smooth Structures on Manifolds with Boundary
To see how to deﬁne a smooth structure on a manifold with boundary, recall that a map from an arbitrary subset A Â Rn to Rk is said to be smooth if in a neighbor-
hood of each point of A it admits an extension to a smooth map deﬁned on an open subset of Rn (see Appendix C, p. 645). Thus, if U is an open subset of Hn, a map F W U ! Rk is smooth if for each x 2 U , there exists an open subset Uz Â Rn containing x and a smooth map Fz W Uz ! Rk that agrees with F on Uz \ Hn (Fig. 1.12). If F is such a map, the restriction of F to U \ Int Hn is smooth in the usual sense. By continuity, all partial derivatives of F at points of U \ @Hn are determined by their values in Int Hn, and therefore in particular are independent of the choice of extension. It is a fact (which we will neither prove nor use) that F W U ! Rk is
smooth in this sense if and only if F is continuous, F jU \IntHn is smooth, and the partial derivatives of F jU \IntHn of all orders have continuous extensions to all of U . (One direction is obvious; the other direction depends on a lemma of Émile Borel,
which shows that there is a smooth function deﬁned in the lower half-space whose derivatives all match those of F on U \ @Hn. See, e.g., [Hör90, Thm. 1.2.6].)

Thus g is not smooth on U .

Now let M be a topological manifold with boundary. As in the manifold case,

a smooth structure for M is deﬁned to be a maximal smooth atlas—a collection

of charts whose domains cover M and whose transition maps (and their inverses)

are smooth in the sense just described. With such a structure, M is called a smooth

manifold with boundary. Every smooth manifold is automatically a smooth mani-

fold with boundary (whose boundary is empty).

Just as for smooth manifolds, if M is a smooth manifold with boundary, any

chart in the given smooth atlas is called a smooth chart for M . Smooth coordinate

balls, smooth coordinate half-balls, and regular coordinate balls in M are deﬁned

in the obvious ways. In addition, a subset B Â M is called a regular coordinate half-ball if there is a smooth coordinate half-ball B0 Ã Bx and a smooth coordinate
map ' W B0 ! Hn such that for some r0 > r > 0 we have

'.B/ D Br .0/ \ Hn; ' Bx D Bxr .0/ \ Hn; and ' B0 D Br0 .0/ \ Hn:

(a) U is a topological n-manifold with boundary, and the atlas consisting of all smooth charts .V; '/ for M such that V Â U deﬁnes a smooth structure on U . With this topology and smooth structure, U is called an open submanifold with boundary.
(b) If U Â Int M; then U is actually a smooth manifold (without boundary); in this case we call it an open submanifold of M .
(c) Int M is an open submanifold of M (without boundary).

One important result about smooth manifolds that does not extend directly to smooth manifolds with boundary is the construction of smooth structures on ﬁnite products (see Example 1.8). Because a product of half-spaces Hn Hm is not itself a half-space, a ﬁnite product of smooth manifolds with boundary cannot generally be considered as a smooth manifold with boundary. (Instead, it is an example of a smooth manifold with corners, which we will study in Chapter 16.) However, we do have the following result.

Proposition 1.45. Suppose M1; : : : ; Mk are smooth manifolds and N is a smooth

manifold with boundary. Then M1

Mk N is a smooth manifold with bound-

ary, and @.M1

Mk N / D M1

Mk @N .

Proof. Problem 1-12.

For smooth manifolds with boundary, the following result is often an adequate substitute for the theorem on invariance of the boundary.

Theorem 1.46 (Smooth Invariance of the Boundary). Suppose M is a smooth manifold with boundary and p 2 M . If there is some smooth chart .U; '/ for M such that '.U / Â Hn and '.p/ 2 @Hn, then the same is true for every smooth chart
whose domain contains p.

Proof. Suppose on the contrary that p is in the domain of a smooth interior chart
.U; / and also in the domain of a smooth boundary chart .V; '/ such that '.p/ 2 @Hn. Let D ' ı 1 denote the transition map; it is a homeomorphism from
.U \ V / to '.U \ V /. The smooth compatibility of the charts ensures that both and 1 are smooth, in the sense that locally they can be extended, if necessary, to smooth maps deﬁned on open subsets of Rn.
Write x0 D .p/ and y0 D '.p/ D .x0/. There is some neighborhood W of y0 in Rn and a smooth function ÁW W ! Rn that agrees with 1 on W \ '.U \ V /.
On the other hand, because we are assuming that is an interior chart, there is
an open Euclidean ball B that is centered at x0 and contained in '.U \ V /, so
itself is smooth on B in the ordinary sense. After shrinking B if necessary, we may assume that B Â 1.W /. Then Á ı jB D 1 ı jB D IdB , so it follows from the chain rule that DÁ. .x// ı D .x/ is the identity map for each x 2 B. Since D .x/
is a square matrix, this implies that it is nonsingular. It follows from Corollary C.36 that (considered as a map from B to Rn) is an open map, so .B/ is an open subset of Rn that contains y0 D '.p/ and is contained in '.V /. This contradicts the assumption that '.V / Â Hn and '.p/ 2 @Hn.

Chapter 2
Smooth Maps

The main reason for introducing smooth structures was to enable us to deﬁne smooth functions on manifolds and smooth maps between manifolds. In this chapter we carry out that project.
We begin by deﬁning smooth real-valued and vector-valued functions, and then generalize this to smooth maps between manifolds. We then focus our attention for a while on the special case of diffeomorphisms, which are bijective smooth maps with smooth inverses. If there is a diffeomorphism between two smooth manifolds, we say that they are diffeomorphic. The main objects of study in smooth manifold theory are properties that are invariant under diffeomorphisms.
At the end of the chapter, we introduce a powerful tool for blending together locally deﬁned smooth objects, called partitions of unity. They are used throughout smooth manifold theory for building global smooth objects out of local ones.

Smooth Functions and Smooth Maps
Although the terms function and map are technically synonymous, in studying smooth manifolds it is often convenient to make a slight distinction between them. Throughout this book we generally reserve the term function for a map whose codomain is R (a real-valued function) or Rk for some k > 1 (a vector-valued function). Either of the words map or mapping can mean any type of map, such as a map between arbitrary manifolds.

Smooth Functions on Manifolds
Suppose M is a smooth n-manifold, k is a nonnegative integer, and f W M ! Rk is any function. We say that f is a smooth function if for every p 2 M; there exists a smooth chart .U; '/ for M whose domain contains p and such that the composite function f ı ' 1 is smooth on the open subset Uy D '.U / Â Rn (Fig. 2.1). If M is a smooth manifold with boundary, the deﬁnition is exactly the same, except that

Fig. 2.1 Deﬁnition of smooth functions
'.U / is now an open subset of either Rn or Hn, and in the latter case we interpret smoothness of f ı ' 1 to mean that each point of '.U / has a neighborhood (in Rn) on which f ı ' 1 extends to a smooth function in the ordinary sense.
The most important special case is that of smooth real-valued functions f W M ! R; the set of all such functions is denoted by C 1.M /. Because sums and constant multiples of smooth functions are smooth, C 1.M / is a vector space over R.
I Exercise 2.1. Let M be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. Show that pointwise multiplication turns C 1.M / into a commutative ring and a commutative and associative algebra over R. (See Appendix B, p. 624, for the deﬁnition of an algebra.)
I Exercise 2.2. Let U be an open submanifold of Rn with its standard smooth manifold structure. Show that a function f W U ! Rk is smooth in the sense just deﬁned if and only if it is smooth in the sense of ordinary calculus. Do the same for an open submanifold with boundary in Hn (see Exercise 1.44).
I Exercise 2.3. Let M be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and suppose f W M ! Rk is a smooth function. Show that f ı ' 1 W '.U / ! Rk is smooth for every smooth chart .U; '/ for M .
Given a function f W M ! Rk and a chart .U; '/ for M; the function fyW '.U / ! Rk deﬁned by fy.x/ D f ı ' 1.x/ is called the coordinate representation of f . By deﬁnition, f is smooth if and only if its coordinate representation is smooth in some smooth chart around each point. By the preceding exercise, smooth functions have smooth coordinate representations in every smooth chart.
For example, consider the real-valued function f .x; y/ D x2 C y2 deﬁned on the plane. In polar coordinates on, say, the set U D f.x; y/ W x > 0g, it has the coordinate representation fy.r; Â / D r2. In keeping with our practice of using local coordinates

to identify an open subset of a manifold with an open subset of Euclidean space, in cases where it causes no confusion we often do not even observe the distinction between fy and f itself, and instead say something like “f is smooth on U because its coordinate representation f .r; Â / D r2 is smooth.”
Smooth Maps Between Manifolds
The deﬁnition of smooth functions generalizes easily to maps between manifolds. Let M; N be smooth manifolds, and let F W M ! N be any map. We say that F is a smooth map if for every p 2 M; there exist smooth charts .U; '/ containing p and .V; / containing F .p/ such that F .U / Â V and the composite map ı F ı ' 1 is smooth from '.U / to .V / (Fig. 2.2). If M and N are smooth manifolds with boundary, smoothness of F is deﬁned in exactly the same way, with the usual understanding that a map whose domain is a subset of Hn is smooth if it admits an extension to a smooth map in a neighborhood of each point, and a map whose codomain is a subset of Hn is smooth if it is smooth as a map into Rn. Note that our previous deﬁnition of smoothness of real-valued or vector-valued functions can be viewed as a special case of this one, by taking N D V D Rk and D IdW Rk ! Rk.
The ﬁrst important observation about our deﬁnition of smooth maps is that, as one might expect, smoothness implies continuity.
Proposition 2.4. Every smooth map is continuous.
Proof. Suppose M and N are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and F W M ! N is smooth. Given p 2 M; smoothness of F means there are smooth charts .U; '/ containing p and .V; / containing F .p/, such that F .U / Â V and
ı F ı ' 1 W '.U / ! .V / is smooth, hence continuous. Since ' W U ! '.U / and W V ! .V / are homeomorphisms, this implies in turn that
F jU D 1 ı ı F ı ' 1 ı ' W U ! V;

which is a composition of continuous maps. Since F is continuous in a neighborhood of each point, it is continuous on M .
To prove that a map F W M ! N is smooth directly from the deﬁnition requires, in part, that for each p 2 M we prove the existence of coordinate domains U containing p and V containing F .p/ such that F .U / Â V . This requirement is included in the deﬁnition precisely so that smoothness automatically implies continuity. (Problem 2-1 illustrates what can go wrong if this requirement is omitted.) There are other ways of characterizing smoothness of maps between manifolds that accomplish the same thing. Here are two of them.
Proposition 2.5 (Equivalent Characterizations of Smoothness). Suppose M and N are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and F W M ! N is a map. Then F is smooth if and only if either of the following conditions is satisﬁed:
(a) For every p 2 M; there exist smooth charts .U; '/ containing p and .V; / containing F .p/ such that U \ F 1.V / is open in M and the composite map ı F ı ' 1 is smooth from ' U \ F 1.V / to .V /.
(b) F is continuous and there exist smooth atlases f.U˛; '˛/g and f.Vˇ ; ˇ /g for M and N , respectively, such that for each ˛ and ˇ, ˇ ı F ı '˛ 1 is a smooth map from '˛ U˛ \ F 1.Vˇ / to ˇ .Vˇ /.
Proposition 2.6 (Smoothness Is Local). Let M and N be smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and let F W M ! N be a map.
(a) If every point p 2 M has a neighborhood U such that the restriction F jU is smooth, then F is smooth.
(b) Conversely, if F is smooth, then its restriction to every open subset is smooth.
I Exercise 2.7. Prove the preceding two propositions.
The next corollary is essentially just a restatement of the previous proposition, but it gives a highly useful way of constructing smooth maps.
Corollary 2.8 (Gluing Lemma for Smooth Maps). Let M and N be smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and let fU˛g˛2A be an open cover of M . Suppose that for each ˛ 2 A, we are given a smooth map F˛ W U˛ ! N such that the maps agree on overlaps: F˛jU˛\Uˇ D Fˇ jU˛\Uˇ for all ˛ and ˇ. Then there exists a unique smooth map F W M ! N such that F jU˛ D F˛ for each ˛ 2 A.
If F W M ! N is a smooth map, and .U; '/ and .V; / are any smooth charts for M and N , respectively, we call Fy D ı F ı ' 1 the coordinate representation of F with respect to the given coordinates. It maps the set ' U \ F 1.V / to
.V /.
I Exercise 2.9. Suppose F W M ! N is a smooth map between smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Show that the coordinate representation of F with respect to every pair of smooth charts for M and N is smooth.

2 Smooth Maps

Fig. 2.3 A composition of smooth maps is smooth

As with real-valued or vector-valued functions, once we have chosen speciﬁc
local coordinates in both the domain and codomain, we can often ignore the distinction between F and Fy.
Next we examine some simple classes of maps that are automatically smooth.

Proposition 2.10. Let M; N; and P be smooth manifolds with or without boundary.
(a) Every constant map c W M ! N is smooth. (b) The identity map of M is smooth. (c) If U Â M is an open submanifold with or without boundary, then the inclusion
map U ,! M is smooth. (d) If F W M ! N and G W N ! P are smooth, then so is G ı F W M ! P .
Proof. We prove (d) and leave the rest as exercises. Let F W M ! N and G W N ! P be smooth maps, and let p 2 M . By deﬁnition of smoothness of G, there exist smooth charts .V; Â / containing F .p/ and .W; / containing G.F .p// such that G.V / Â W and ı G ı Â 1 W Â.V / ! .W / is smooth. Since F is continuous, F 1.V / is a neighborhood of p in M; so there is a smooth chart .U; '/ for M such that p 2 U Â F 1.V / (Fig. 2.3). By Exercise 2.9, Â ı F ı ' 1 is smooth from '.U / to Â.V /. Then we have G ı F .U / Â G.V / Â W , and ı .G ı F / ı ' 1 D
ı G ı Â 1 ı Â ı F ı ' 1 W '.U / ! .W / is smooth because it is a composition of smooth maps between subsets of Euclidean spaces.

I Exercise 2.11. Prove parts (a)–(c) of the preceding proposition.

Proposition 2.12. Suppose M1; : : : ; Mk and N are smooth manifolds with or with-

out boundary, such that at most one of M1; : : : ; Mk has nonempty boundary. For

Smooth Functions and Smooth Maps

Proof. Problem 2-2.
Although most of our efforts in this book are devoted to the study of smooth manifolds and smooth maps, we also need to work with topological manifolds and continuous maps on occasion. For the sake of consistency, we adopt the following conventions: without further qualiﬁcation, the words “function” and “map” are to be understood purely in the set-theoretic sense, and carry no assumptions of continuity or smoothness. Most other objects we study, however, will be understood to carry some minimal topological structure by default. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, a “manifold” or “manifold with boundary” is always to be understood as a topological one, and a “coordinate chart” is to be understood in the topological sense, as a homeomorphism from an open subset of the manifold to an open subset of Rn or Hn. If we wish to restrict attention to smooth manifolds or smooth coordinate charts, we will say so. Similarly, our default assumptions for many other speciﬁc types of geometric objects and the maps between them will be continuity at most; smoothness will not be assumed unless explicitly speciﬁed. The only exceptions will be a few concepts that require smoothness for their very deﬁnitions.
This convention requires a certain discipline, in that we have to remember to state the smoothness hypothesis whenever it is needed; but its advantage is that it frees us (for the most part) from having to remember which types of maps are assumed to be smooth and which are not.
On the other hand, because the deﬁnition of a smooth map requires smooth structures in the domain and codomain, if we say “F W M ! N is a smooth map” without specifying what M and N are, it should always be understood that they are smooth manifolds with or without boundaries.
We now have enough information to produce a number of interesting examples of smooth maps. In spite of the apparent complexity of the deﬁnition, it is usually not hard to prove that a particular map is smooth. There are basically only three common ways to do so:
Write the map in smooth local coordinates and recognize its component functions as compositions of smooth elementary functions. Exhibit the map as a composition of maps that are known to be smooth. Use some special-purpose theorem that applies to the particular case under consideration.
Example 2.13 (Smooth Maps).
(a) Any map from a zero-dimensional manifold into a smooth manifold with or without boundary is automatically smooth, because each coordinate representation is constant.
(b) If the circle S1 is given its standard smooth structure, the map "W R ! S1 deﬁned by ".t / D e2 it is smooth, because with respect to any angle coordinate Â for S1 (see Problem 1-8) it has a coordinate representation of the form "y.t/ D 2 t C c for some constant c, as you can check.
(c) The map "n W Rn ! T n deﬁned by "n x1; : : : ; xn D e2 ix1 ; : : : ; e2 ixn is smooth by Proposition 2.12.

(d) Now consider the n-sphere Sn with its standard smooth structure. The inclusion map ÃW Sn ,! RnC1 is certainly continuous, because it is the inclusion map of a
topological subspace. It is a smooth map because its coordinate representation
with respect to any of the graph coordinates of Example 1.31 is

which is smooth on its domain (the set where juj2 < 1). (e) The quotient map W RnC1 X f0g ! RP n used to deﬁne RP n is smooth, be-
cause its coordinate representation in terms of any of the coordinates for RP n constructed in Example 1.33 and standard coordinates on RnC1 X f0g is

maps in the preceding two examples.

(g) If M1; : : : ; Mk are smooth manifolds, then each projection map i W M1

Mk ! Mi is smooth, because its coordinate representation with respect to any

of the product charts of Example 1.8 is just a coordinate projection.

//

Diffeomorphisms

If M and N are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, a diffeomorphism from M to N is a smooth bijective map F W M ! N that has a smooth inverse. We say that M and N are diffeomorphic if there exists a diffeomorphism between them. Sometimes this is symbolized by M N .

Example 2.14 (Diffeomorphisms).

(a) Consider the maps F W Bn ! Rn and G W Rn ! Bn given by

F .x/ D p x ; G.y/ D p y :

(2.1)

1 jxj2

1 C jyj2

These maps are smooth, and it is straightforward to compute that they are inverses of each other. Thus they are both diffeomorphisms, and therefore Bn is

diffeomorphic to Rn.

(b) If M is any smooth manifold and .U; '/ is a smooth coordinate chart on M;

then ' W U ! '.U / Â Rn is a diffeomorphism. (In fact, it has an identity map

as a coordinate representation.)

Proposition 2.15 (Properties of Diffeomorphisms).
(a) Every composition of diffeomorphisms is a diffeomorphism. (b) Every ﬁnite product of diffeomorphisms between smooth manifolds is a diffeo-
morphism. (c) Every diffeomorphism is a homeomorphism and an open map. (d) The restriction of a diffeomorphism to an open submanifold with or without
boundary is a diffeomorphism onto its image. (e) “Diffeomorphic” is an equivalence relation on the class of all smooth manifolds
with or without boundary.
I Exercise 2.16. Prove the preceding proposition.
The following theorem is a weak version of invariance of dimension, which sufﬁces for many purposes.
Theorem 2.17 (Diffeomorphism Invariance of Dimension). A nonempty smooth manifold of dimension m cannot be diffeomorphic to an n-dimensional smooth manifold unless m D n.
Proof. Suppose M is a nonempty smooth m-manifold, N is a nonempty smooth nmanifold, and F W M ! N is a diffeomorphism. Choose any point p 2 M; and let .U; '/ and .V; / be smooth coordinate charts containing p and F .p/, respectively. Then (the restriction of) Fy D ı F ı ' 1 is a diffeomorphism from an open subset of Rm to an open subset of Rn, so it follows from Proposition C.4 that m D n.
There is a similar invariance statement for boundaries.
Theorem 2.18 (Diffeomorphism Invariance of the Boundary). Suppose M and N are smooth manifolds with boundary and F W M ! N is a diffeomorphism. Then F .@M / D @N , and F restricts to a diffeomorphism from Int M to Int N .
I Exercise 2.19. Use Theorem 1.46 to prove the preceding theorem.
Just as two topological spaces are considered to be “the same” if they are homeomorphic, two smooth manifolds with or without boundary are essentially indistinguishable if they are diffeomorphic. The central concern of smooth manifold theory is the study of properties of smooth manifolds that are preserved by diffeomorphisms. Theorem 2.17 shows that dimension is one such property.
It is natural to wonder whether the smooth structure on a given topological manifold is unique. This straightforward version of the question is easy to answer: we observed in Example 1.21 that every zero-dimensional manifold has a unique smooth structure, but as Problem 1-6 showed, each positive-dimensional manifold admits many distinct smooth structures as soon as it admits one.
A more subtle and interesting question is whether a given topological manifold admits smooth structures that are not diffeomorphic to each other. For example, let Rz denote the topological manifold R, but endowed with the smooth structure described in Example 1.23 (deﬁned by the global chart .x/ D x3). It turns out that Rz is diffeomorphic to R with its standard smooth structure. Deﬁne

40

a map F W R ! Rz by F .x/ D x1=3. The coordinate representation of this map is Fy.t / D ı F ı IdR1.t / D t , which is clearly smooth. Moreover, the coordinate representation of its inverse is
bF 1.y/ D IdR ıF 1 ı 1.y/ D y;
which is also smooth, so F is a diffeomorphism. (This is a case in which it is important to maintain the distinction between a map and its coordinate representation!)
In fact, as you will see later, there is only one smooth structure on R up to diffeomorphism (see Problem 15-13). More precisely, if A1 and A2 are any two smooth structures on R, there exists a diffeomorphism F W .R; A1/ ! .R; A2/. In fact, it follows from work of James Munkres [Mun60] and Edwin Moise [Moi77] that every topological manifold of dimension less than or equal to 3 has a smooth structure that is unique up to diffeomorphism. The analogous question in higher dimensions turns out to be quite deep, and is still largely unanswered. Even for Euclidean spaces, the question of uniqueness of smooth structures was not completely settled until late in the twentieth century. The answer is surprising: as long as n ¤ 4, Rn has a unique smooth structure (up to diffeomorphism); but R4 has uncountably many distinct smooth structures, no two of which are diffeomorphic to each other! The existence of nonstandard smooth structures on R4 (called fake R4’s) was ﬁrst proved by Simon Donaldson and Michael Freedman in 1984 as a consequence of their work on the geometry and topology of compact 4-manifolds; the results are described in [DK90] and [FQ90].
For compact manifolds, the situation is even more fascinating. In 1956, John Milnor [Mil56] showed that there are smooth structures on S7 that are not diffeomorphic to the standard one. Later, he and Michel Kervaire [KM63] showed (using a deep theorem of Steve Smale [Sma62]) that there are exactly 15 diffeomorphism classes of such structures (or 28 classes if you restrict to diffeomorphisms that preserve a property called orientation, which will be discussed in Chapter 15).
On the other hand, in all dimensions greater than 3 there are compact topological manifolds that have no smooth structures at all. The problem of identifying the number of smooth structures (if any) on topological 4-manifolds is an active subject of current research.

Partitions of Unity
A frequently used tool in topology is the gluing lemma (Lemma A.20), which shows how to construct continuous maps by “gluing together” maps deﬁned on open or closed subsets. We have a version of the gluing lemma for smooth maps deﬁned on open subsets (Corollary 2.8), but we cannot expect to glue together smooth maps deﬁned on closed subsets and obtain a smooth result. For example, the two functions fC W Œ0; 1/ ! R and f W . 1; 0 ! R deﬁned by
fC.x/ D Cx; x 2 Œ0; 1/;
f .x/ D x; x 2 . 1; 0;

are both smooth and agree at the point 0 where they overlap, but the continuous function f W R ! R that they deﬁne, namely f .x/ D jxj, is not smooth at the origin.
A disadvantage of Corollary 2.8 is that in order to use it, we must construct maps that agree exactly on relatively large subsets of the manifold, which is too restrictive for some purposes. In this section we introduce partitions of unity, which are tools for “blending together” local smooth objects into global ones without necessarily assuming that they agree on overlaps. They are indispensable in smooth manifold theory and will reappear throughout the book.
All of our constructions in this section are based on the existence of smooth functions that are positive in a speciﬁed part of a manifold and identically zero in some other part. We begin by deﬁning a smooth function on the real line that is zero for t Ä 0 and positive for t > 0.

Lemma 2.20. The function f W R ! R deﬁned by

( e 1=t ; t > 0;

f .t/ D

0;

t Ä 0;

is smooth.
Proof. The function in question is pictured in Fig. 2.4. It is smooth on R X f0g by composition, so we need only show f has continuous derivatives of all orders at the origin. Because existence of the .k C 1/st derivative implies continuity of the kth, it sufﬁces to show that each such derivative exists. We begin by noting that f is continuous at 0 because limt&0 e 1=t D 0. In fact, a standard application of l’Hôpital’s rule and induction shows that for any integer k 0,

e 1=t

D lim D 0:

We show by induction that for t > 0, the kth derivative of f is of the form

(2.3)

for some polynomial pk of degree at most k. This is clearly true (with p0.t / D 1) for k D 0, so suppose it is true for some k 0. By the product rule,

e 1=t 2k tpk.t / t 2.kC1/ ;

which is of the required form. Finally, we prove by induction that f .k/.0/ D 0 for each integer k 0. For k D 0
this is true by deﬁnition, so assume that it is true for some k 0. To prove that f .kC1/.0/ exists, it sufﬁces to show that f .k/ has one-sided derivatives from both
sides at t D 0 and that they are equal. Clearly, the derivative from the left is zero.

Lemma 2.21. Given any real numbers r1 and r2 such that r1 < r2, there exists a smooth function hW R ! R such that h.t / Á 1 for t Ä r1, 0 < h.t / < 1 for r1 < t < r2, and h.t / Á 0 for t r2.
Proof. Let f be the function of the previous lemma, and set

h.t/ D

f .r2 t /

:

f .r2 t / C f .t r1/

(See Fig. 2.5.) Note that the denominator is positive for all t , because at least one of the expressions r2 t and t r1 is always positive. The desired properties of h follow easily from those of f .

A function with the properties of h in the preceding lemma is usually called a cutoff function.

Lemma 2.22. Given any positive real numbers r1 < r2, there is a smooth function H W Rn ! R such that H Á 1 on Bxr1 .0/, 0 < H.x/ < 1 for all x 2 Br2 .0/ X Bxr1 .0/, and H Á 0 on Rn X Br2 .0/.
Proof. Just set H.x/ D h.jxj/, where h is the function of the preceding lemma. Clearly, H is smooth on Rn X f0g, because it is a composition of smooth functions there. Since it is identically equal to 1 on Br1 .0/, it is smooth there too.
The function H constructed in this lemma is an example of a smooth bump function, a smooth real-valued function that is equal to 1 on a speciﬁed set and is zero outside a speciﬁed neighborhood of that set. Later in this chapter, we will generalize this notion to manifolds.

If f is any real-valued or vector-valued function on a topological space M; the

support of f , denoted by supp f , is the closure of the set of points where f is

nonzero:

˚

«

supp f D p 2 M W f .p/ ¤ 0 :

(For example, if H is the function constructed in the preceding lemma, then supp H D Bxr2 .0/.) If supp f is contained in some set U Â M; we say that f is supported in U . A function f is said to be compactly supported if supp f is a
compact set. Clearly, every function on a compact space is compactly supported.
The next construction is the most important application of paracompactness. Suppose M is a topological space, and let X D .X˛/˛2A be an arbitrary open cover of M; indexed by a set A. A partition of unity subordinate to X is an indexed family . ˛/˛2A of continuous functions ˛ W M ! R with the following properties:

(i) 0 Ä ˛.x/ Ä 1 for all ˛ 2 A and all x 2 M . (ii) supp ˛ Â X˛ for each ˛ 2 A. (iii) The family of supports .supp ˛/˛2A is locally ﬁnite, meaning that every point
hPas a neighborhood that intersects supp ˛ for only ﬁnitely many values of ˛. (iv) ˛2A ˛.x/ D 1 for all x 2 M .
Because of the local ﬁniteness condition (iii), the sum in (iv) actually has only ﬁnitely many nonzero terms in a neighborhood of each point, so there is no issue of convergence. If M is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, a smooth partition of unity is one for which each of the functions ˛ is smooth.

Theorem 2.23 (Existence of Partitions of Unity). Suppose M is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and X D .X˛/˛2A is any indexed open cover of M . Then there exists a smooth partition of unity subordinate to X.

Proof. For simplicity, suppose for this proof that M is a smooth manifold without

boundary; the general case is left as an exercise. Each set X˛ is a smooth manifold in

its own right, and thus has a basisSB˛ of regular coordinate balls by Proposition 1.19,

and it is easy to check that B D ˛ B˛ is a basis for the topology of M . It follows

from Theorem of elements of

reﬁnement fBi g consisting also locally ﬁnite.

For each i , the fact that Bi is a regular coordinate ball in some X˛ guarantees that there is a coordinate ball Bi0 Â X˛ such that Bi0 Ã Bxi , and a smooth coordinate map 'i W Bi0 ! Rn such that 'i Bxi D Bxri .0/ and 'i .Bi0/ D Bri0 .0/ for some ri < ri0. For
each i , deﬁne a function fi W M ! R by

( Hi ı 'i

on Bi0; on M X Bxi ;

where Hi W Rn ! R is a smooth function that is positive in Bri .0/ and zero elsewhere, as in Lemma 2.22. On the set Bi0 X Bxi where the two deﬁnitions overlap,
both deﬁnitions yield the zero function, so fi is well deﬁned and smooth, and supp fi D Bxi .

by gi .x/ D fi .Px/=f .x/ are also smooth. It is immediate from the deﬁnition that 0 Ä gi Ä 1 and i gi Á 1.

Finally, we need to reindex our functions so that they are indexed by the same

I Exercise 2.24. Show how the preceding proof needs to be modiﬁed for the case in which M has nonempty boundary.

There are basically two different strategies for patching together locally deﬁned smooth maps to obtain a global one. If you can deﬁne a map in a neighborhood of each point in such a way that the locally deﬁned maps all agree where they overlap, then the local deﬁnitions piece together to yield a global smooth map by Corollary 2.8. (This usually requires some sort of uniqueness result.) But if the local deﬁnitions are not guaranteed to agree, then you usually have to resort to a partition of unity. The trick then is showing that the patched-together objects still have the required properties. We use both strategies repeatedly throughout the book.

Applications of Partitions of Unity
As our ﬁrst application of partitions of unity, we extend the notion of bump functions to arbitrary closed subsets of manifolds. If M is a topological space, A Â M is a closed subset, and U Â M is an open subset containing A, a continuous function
W M ! R is called a bump function for A supported in U if 0 Ä Ä 1 on M; Á 1 on A, and supp Â U .
Proposition 2.25 (Existence of Smooth Bump Functions). Let M be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. For any closed subset A Â M and any open subset U containing A, there exists a smooth bump function for A supported in U .

Partitions of Unity

Proof. Let U0 D U and U1 D M X A, and let f 0; 1g be a smooth partition of P unity subordinate to the open cover fU0; U1g. Because 1 Á 0 on A and thus 0 D
i i D 1 there, the function 0 has the required properties.
Our second application is an important result concerning the possibility of extending smooth functions from closed subsets. Suppose M and N are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and A Â M is an arbitrary subset. We say that a map F W A ! N is smooth on A if it has a smooth extension in a neighborhood of each point: that is, if for every p 2 A there is an open subset W Â M containing p and a smooth map Fz W W ! N whose restriction to W \ A agrees with F .

Lemma 2.26 (Extension Lemma for Smooth Functions). Suppose M is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, A Â M is a closed subset, and f W A ! Rk is a
smooth function. For any open subset U containing A, there exists a smooth function fzW M ! Rk such that fzjA D f and supp fz Â U .

Proof. For each p 2 A, choose a neighborhood Wp of p and a smooth function fzp W Wp ! Rk that agrees with f on Wp \ A. Replacing Wp by Wp \ U , we may assume that Wp Â U . The family of sets fWp W p 2 Ag [ fM X Ag is an open cover of M . Let f p W p 2 Ag [ f 0g be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover, with supp p Â Wp and supp 0 Â M X A.
For each p 2 A, the product pfzp is smooth on Wp, and has a smooth extension to all of M if we interpret it to be zero on M X supp p. (The extended function is smooth because the two deﬁnitions agree on the open subset Wp X supp p where they overlap.) Thus we can deﬁne fzW M ! Rk by

Because the collection of supports fsupp pg is locally ﬁnite, this sum actually has

only a ﬁnite number of nonzero terms in a neighborhood of any point of M; and

therefore deﬁnes a smooth function. If x 2 A, then 0.x/ D 0 and fzp.x/ D f .x/

I Exercise 2.27. Give a counterexample to show that the conclusion of the extension lemma can be false if A is not closed.

The assumption in the extension lemma that the codomain of f is Rk, and not
some other smooth manifold, is needed: for other codomains, extensions can fail to exist for topological reasons. (For example, the identity map S1 ! S1 is smooth,

2 Smooth Maps

but does not have even a continuous extension to a map from R2 to S1.) Later we will show that a smooth map from a closed subset of a smooth manifold into a smooth manifold has a smooth extension if and only if it has a continuous one (see Corollary 6.27).
This extension lemma, by the way, illustrates an essential difference between smooth manifolds and real-analytic manifolds. The analogue of the extension lemma for real-analytic functions on real-analytic manifolds is decidedly false, because a real-analytic function that is deﬁned on a connected domain and vanishes on an open subset must be identically zero.
Next, we use partitions of unity to construct a special kind of smooth function. If M is a topological space, an exhaustion function for M is a continuous function f W M ! R with the property that the set f 1 . 1; c (called a sublevel set of f ) is compact for each c 2 R. The name comes from the fact that as n ranges over the positive integers, the sublevel sets f 1 . 1; n form an exhaustion of M by compact sets; thus an exhaustion function provides a sort of continuous version of an exhaustion by compact sets. For example, the functions f W Rn ! R and g W Bn ! R given by

f .x/ D jxj2;

are smooth exhaustion functions. Of course, if M is compact, any continuous realvalued function on M is an exhaustion function, so such functions are interesting only for noncompact manifolds.

Proposition 2.28 (Existence of Smooth Exhaustion Functions). Every smooth manifold with or without boundary admits a smooth positive exhaustion function.
Proof. Let M be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, let fVj gj1D1 be any countable open cover of M by precompact open subsets, and let f j g be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover. Deﬁne f 2 C 1.M / by

real-valued function. We will not use this result in this book (except in a few of the problems), but it provides an interesting contrast with the result of Example 1.32.

Theorem 2.29 (Level Sets of Smooth Functions). Let M be a smooth manifold. If K is any closed subset of M; there is a smooth nonnegative function f W M ! R such that f 1.0/ D K.

Proof. We begin with the special case in which M D Rn and K Â Rn is a closed

subset. For each x 2 M X K, there is a positive number r Ä 1 such that Br .x/ Â M X K. By Proposition A.16, M X K is the union of countably many such balls fBri .xi /g1 iD1.
Let hW Rn ! R be a smooth bump function that is equal to 1 on Bx1=2.0/ and supported in B1.0/. For each positive integer i , let Ci 1 be a constant that bounds the absolute values of h and all of its partial derivatives up through order i . Deﬁne f W Rn ! R by

the Weierstrass M -test. Because the i th term is positive exactly when x 2 Bri .xi /,

it follows that f is zero in K and positive elsewhere.

It remains only to show that f is smooth. We have already shown that it is con-

tinuous, so suppose k 1 and assume by induction that all partial derivatives of f

of order less than k exist and are continuous. By the chain rule and induction, every

kth partial derivative of the i th term in the series can be written in the form

.ri /i k 2i Ci

where Dkh is some kth partial derivative of h. By our choices of ri and Ci , as soon as i k, each of these terms is bounded in absolute value by 1=2i , so the differenti-

ated series also converges uniformly to a continuous function. It then follows from

Theorem C.31 that the kth partial derivatives of f exist and are continuous. This

completes the induction, and shows that f is smooth.

Now let M be an arbitrary smooth manifold, and K Â M be any closed subset.

Let fB˛g be an open cover of M by smooth coordinate balls, and let f ˛g be a

Chapter 3
Tangent Vectors

The central idea of calculus is linear approximation. This arises repeatedly in the study of calculus in Euclidean spaces, where, for example, a function of one variable can be approximated by its tangent line, a parametrized curve in Rn by its velocity vector, a surface in R3 by its tangent plane, or a map from Rn to Rm by its total derivative (see Appendix C).
In order to make sense of calculus on manifolds, we need to introduce the tangent space to a manifold at a point, which we can think of as a sort of “linear model” for the manifold near the point. Because of the abstractness of the deﬁnition of a smooth manifold, this takes some work, which we carry out in this chapter.
We begin by studying much more concrete objects: geometric tangent vectors in Rn, which can be visualized as “arrows” attached to points. Because the deﬁnition of smooth manifolds is built around the idea of identifying which functions are smooth, the property of a geometric tangent vector that is amenable to generalization is its action on smooth functions as a “directional derivative.” The key observation, which we prove in the ﬁrst section of this chapter, is that the process of taking directional derivatives gives a natural one-to-one correspondence between geometric tangent vectors and linear maps from C 1 .Rn/ to R satisfying the product rule. (Such maps are called derivations.) With this as motivation, we then deﬁne a tangent vector on a smooth manifold as a derivation of C 1.M / at a point.
In the second section of the chapter, we show how a smooth map between manifolds yields a linear map between tangent spaces, called the differential of the map, which generalizes the total derivative of a map between Euclidean spaces. This allows us to connect the abstract deﬁnition of tangent vectors to our concrete geometric picture by showing that any smooth coordinate chart .U; '/ gives a natural isomorphism from the space of tangent vectors to M at p to the space of tangent vectors to Rn at '.p/, which in turn is isomorphic to the space of geometric tangent vectors at '.p/. Thus, any smooth coordinate chart yields a basis for each tangent space. Using this isomorphism, we describe how to do concrete computations in such a basis. Based on these coordinate computations, we show how the union of all the tangent spaces at all points of a smooth manifold can be “glued together” to form a new manifold, called the tangent bundle of the original manifold.

Tangent Vectors

51

Next we show how a smooth curve determines a tangent vector at each point, called its velocity, which can be regarded as the derivation of C 1.M / that takes the derivative of each function along the curve.
In the ﬁnal two sections we discuss and compare several other approaches to deﬁning tangent spaces, and give a brief overview of the terminology of category theory, which puts the tangent space and differentials in a larger context.

Tangent Vectors
Imagine a manifold in Euclidean space—for example, the unit sphere Sn 1 Â Rn. What do we mean by a “tangent vector” at a point of Sn 1? Before we can answer this question, we have to come to terms with a dichotomy in the way we think about elements of Rn. On the one hand, we usually think of them as points in space, whose only property is location, expressed by the coordinates x1; : : : ; xn . On the other hand, when doing calculus we sometimes think of them instead as vectors, which are objects that have magnitude and direction, but whose location is irrelevant. A vector v D vi ei (where ei denotes the i th standard basis vector) can be visualized as an arrow with its initial point anywhere in Rn; what is relevant from the vector point of view is only which direction it points and how long it is.
What we really have in mind here is a separate copy of Rn at each point. When we talk about vectors tangent to the sphere at a point a, for example, we imagine them as living in a copy of Rn with its origin translated to a.
Geometric Tangent Vectors
Here is a preliminary deﬁnition of tangent vectors in Euclidean space. Given a point a 2 Rn, let us deﬁne the geometric tangent space to Rn at a, denoted by Rna, to be the set fag Rn D f.a; v/ W v 2 Rng. A geometric tangent vector in Rn is an element of Rna for some a 2 Rn. As a matter of notation, we abbreviate .a; v/ as va (or sometimes vja if it is clearer, for example if v itself has a subscript). We think of va as the vector v with its initial point at a (Fig. 3.1).The set Rna is a real vector space under the natural operations
va C wa D .v C w/a; c.va/ D .cv/a:
The vectors ei ja, i D 1; : : : ; n, are a basis for Rna. In fact, as a vector space, Rna is essentially the same as Rn itself; the only reason we add the index a is so that the geometric tangent spaces Rna and Rnb at distinct points a and b will be disjoint sets.
With this deﬁnition we could think of the tangent space to Sn 1 at a point a 2 Sn 1 as a certain subspace of Rna (Fig. 3.2), namely the space of vectors that are orthogonal to the radial unit vector through a, using the inner product that Rna inherits from Rn via the natural isomorphism Rn Š Rna. The problem with this deﬁnition, however, is that it gives us no clue as to how we might deﬁne tangent vectors on an arbitrary smooth manifold, where there is no ambient Euclidean space. So we

52

3 Tangent Vectors

Fig. 3.1 Geometric tangent space

Fig. 3.2 Tangent space to Sn 1

need to look for another characterization of tangent vectors that might make sense

on a manifold.

The only things we have to work with on smooth manifolds so far are smooth

functions, smooth maps, and smooth coordinate charts. One thing that a geometric

tangent vector provides is a means of taking directional derivatives of functions. For

example, any geometric tangent vector va 2 Rna yields a map Dvja W C 1 .Rn/ ! R,

which takes the directional derivative in the direction v at a:

(3.1)

This operation is linear over R and satisﬁes the product rule:

Dvja.fg/ D f .a/Dvjag C g.a/Dvjaf:

(3.2)

If va D vi ei ja in terms of the standard basis, then by the chain rule Dvjaf can be written more concretely as

Dv ja f

(Here we are using the summation convention as usual, so the expression on the right-hand side is understood to be summed over i D 1; : : : ; n. This sum is consistent with our index convention if we stipulate that an upper index “in the denominator” is to be regarded as a lower index.) For example, if va D ej ja, then

@f Dvjaf D @xj .a/:

With this construction in mind, we make the following deﬁnition. If a is a point of Rn, a map w W C 1 .Rn/ ! R is called a derivation at a if it is linear over R and
satisﬁes the following product rule:

w.fg/ D f .a/wg C g.a/wf:

(3.3)

Let TaRn denote the set of all derivations of C 1 .Rn/ at a. Clearly, TaRn is a vector space under the operations

.w1 C w2/f D w1f C w2f; .cw/f D c.wf /:

Tangent Vectors

53

The most important (and perhaps somewhat surprising) fact about TaRn is that it is ﬁnite-dimensional, and in fact is naturally isomorphic to the geometric tangent space Rna that we deﬁned above. The proof will be based on the following lemma.
Lemma 3.1 (Properties of Derivations). Suppose a 2 Rn, w 2 TaRn, and f; g 2 C 1 .Rn/.
(a) If f is a constant function, then wf D 0. (b) If f .a/ D g.a/ D 0, then w.fg/ D 0.

Proof. It sufﬁces to prove (a) for the constant function f1.x/ Á 1, for then f .x/ Á c implies wf D w.cf1/ D cwf1 D 0 by linearity. For f1, the product rule gives

wf1 D w.f1f1/ D f1.a/wf1 C f1.a/wf1 D 2wf1;

which implies that wf1 D 0. Similarly, (b) also follows from the product rule:

w.fg/ D f .a/wg C g.a/wf D 0 C 0 D 0:

The next proposition shows that derivations at a are in one-to-one correspondence with geometric tangent vectors.

Proposition 3.2. Let a 2 Rn.

(a) For each geometric tangent vector va 2 Rna, the map Dvja W C 1 .Rn/ ! R deﬁned by (3.1) is a derivation at a.
(b) The map va 7! Dvja is an isomorphism from Rna onto TaRn.

Proof. The fact that Dvja is a derivation at a is an immediate consequence of the product rule (3.2).

To prove that the map va 7! Dvja is an isomorphism, we note ﬁrst that it is linear, as is easily checked. To see that it is injective, suppose va 2 Rna has the property that Dvja is the zero derivation. Writing va D vi ei ja in terms of the standard basis, and taking f to be the j th coordinate function xj W Rn ! R, thought of as a smooth

function on Rn, we obtain 0 D Dvja

where the last equality follows because @xj =@xi D 0 except when i D j , in which
case it is equal to 1. Since this is true for each j , it follows that va is the zero vector. To prove surjectivity, let w 2 TaRn be arbitrary. Motivated by the computation
in the preceding paragraph, we deﬁne v D vi ei , where the real numbers v1; : : : ; vn are given by vi D w xi . We will show that w D Dvja.
To see this, let f be any smooth real-valued function on Rn. By Taylor’s theorem

Tangent Vectors on Manifolds

Now we are in a position to deﬁne tangent vectors on manifolds and manifolds with
boundary. The deﬁnition is the same in both cases. Let M be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let p be a point of M . A linear map v W C 1.M / ! R is
called a derivation at p if it satisﬁes

v.fg/ D f .p/vg C g.p/vf for all f; g 2 C 1.M /:

(3.4)

The set of all derivations of C 1.M / at p, denoted by TpM; is a vector space called the tangent space to M at p. An element of TpM is called a tangent vector at p.
The following lemma is the analogue of Lemma 3.1 for manifolds.

Lemma 3.4 (Properties of Tangent Vectors on Manifolds). Suppose M is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, p 2 M; v 2 TpM; and f; g 2 C 1.M /.
(a) If f is a constant function, then vf D 0. (b) If f .p/ D g.p/ D 0, then v.fg/ D 0.

I Exercise 3.5. Prove Lemma 3.4.

With the motivation of geometric tangent vectors in Rn in mind, you should visualize tangent vectors to M as “arrows” that are tangent to M and whose base points are attached to M at the given point. Proofs of theorems about tangent vectors must, of course, be based on the abstract deﬁnition in terms of derivations, but your intuition should be guided as much as possible by the geometric picture.

The Differential of a Smooth Map

55

Fig. 3.3 The differential
The Differential of a Smooth Map
To relate the abstract tangent spaces we have deﬁned on manifolds to geometric tangent spaces in Rn, we have to explore the way smooth maps affect tangent vectors. In the case of a smooth map between Euclidean spaces, the total derivative of the map at a point (represented by its Jacobian matrix) is a linear map that represents the “best linear approximation” to the map near the given point. In the manifold case there is a similar linear map, but it makes no sense to talk about a linear map between manifolds. Instead, it will be a linear map between tangent spaces.
If M and N are smooth manifolds with or without boundary and F W M ! N is a smooth map, for each p 2 M we deﬁne a map
dFp W TpM ! TF .p/N;
called the differential of F at p (Fig. 3.3), as follows. Given v 2 TpM; we let dFp.v/ be the derivation at F .p/ that acts on f 2 C 1.N / by the rule
dFp.v/.f / D v.f ı F /:
Note that if f 2 C 1.N /, then f ı F 2 C 1.M /, so v.f ı F / makes sense. The operator dFp.v/W C 1.N / ! R is linear because v is, and is a derivation at F .p/ because for any f; g 2 C 1.N / we have

I Exercise 3.7. Prove Proposition 3.6.
Our ﬁrst important application of the differential will be to use coordinate charts to relate the tangent space to a point on a manifold with the Euclidean tangent space. But there is an important technical issue that we must address ﬁrst: while the tangent space is deﬁned in terms of smooth functions on the whole manifold, coordinate charts are in general deﬁned only on open subsets. The key point, expressed in the next proposition, is that tangent vectors act locally.
Proposition 3.8. Let M be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, p 2 M; and v 2 TpM . If f; g 2 C 1.M / agree on some neighborhood of p, then vf D vg.
Proof. Let h D f g, so that h is a smooth function that vanishes in a neighborhood of p. Let 2 C 1.M / be a smooth bump function that is identically equal to 1 on the support of h and is supported in M Xfpg. Because Á 1 where h is nonzero, the product h is identically equal to h. Since h.p/ D .p/ D 0, Lemma 3.4 implies that vh D v. h/ D 0. By linearity, this implies vf D vg.
Using this proposition, we can identify the tangent space to an open submanifold with the tangent space to the whole manifold.
Proposition 3.9 (The Tangent Space to an Open Submanifold). Let M be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, let U Â M be an open subset, and let ÃW U ,! M be the inclusion map. For every p 2 U , the differential d Ãp W TpU ! TpM is an isomorphism.
Proof. To prove injectivity, suppose v 2 TpU and d Ãp.v/ D 0 2 TpM . Let B be a neighborhood of p such that Bx Â U . If f 2 C 1.U / is arbitrary, the extension lemma for smooth functions guarantees that there exists fz 2 C 1.M / such that fz Á f on Bx. Then since f and fzjU are smooth functions on U that agree in a neighborhood of p, Proposition 3.8 implies
vf D v fzjU D v fz ı Ã D d Ã.v/pfz D 0:
Since this holds for every f 2 C 1.U /, it follows that v D 0, so d Ãp is injective. On the other hand, to prove surjectivity, suppose w 2 TpM is arbitrary. Deﬁne
an operator v W C 1.U / ! R by setting vf D wfz, where fz is any smooth function on all of M that agrees with f on Bx. By Proposition 3.8, vf is independent of the choice of fz, so v is well deﬁned, and it is easy to check that it is a derivation of C 1.U / at p. For any g 2 C 1.M /,
e d Ãp.v/g D v.g ı Ã/ D w g ı Ã D wg;
e where the last two equalities follow from the facts that g ı Ã, g ı Ã, and g all agree
on B. Therefore, d Ãp is also surjective.
Given an open subset U Â M; the isomorphism d Ãp between TpU and TpM is canonically deﬁned, independently of any choices. From now on we identify TpU with TpM for any point p 2 U . This identiﬁcation just amounts to the observation

The Differential of a Smooth Map

57

Fig. 3.4 The tangent space to a manifold with boundary
that d Ãp.v/ is the same derivation as v, thought of as acting on functions on the bigger manifold M instead of functions on U . Since the action of a derivation on a function depends only on the values of the function in an arbitrarily small neighborhood, this is a harmless identiﬁcation. In particular, this means that any tangent vector v 2 TpM can be unambiguously applied to functions deﬁned only in a neighborhood of p, not necessarily on all of M .
Proposition 3.10 (Dimension of the Tangent Space). If M is an n-dimensional smooth manifold, then for each p 2 M; the tangent space TpM is an n-dimensional vector space.
Proof. Given p 2 M; let .U; '/ be a smooth coordinate chart containing p. Because ' is a diffeomorphism from U onto an open subset Uy Â Rn, it follows from Proposition 3.6(d) that d'p is an isomorphism from TpU to T'.p/Uy . Since Proposition 3.9 guarantees that TpM Š TpU and T'.p/Uy Š T'.p/Rn, it follows that dim TpM D dim T'.p/Rn D n.
Next we need to prove an analogous result for manifolds with boundary. In fact, if M is an n-manifold with boundary, it might not be immediately clear what one should expect the tangent space at a boundary point of M to look like. Should it be an n-dimensional vector space, like the tangent space at an interior point? Or should it be .n 1/-dimensional, like the boundary? Or should it be an n-dimensional halfspace, like the space Hn on which M is modeled locally?
As we will show below, our deﬁnition implies that the tangent space at a boundary point is an n-dimensional vector space (Fig. 3.4), just like the tangent spaces at interior points. This may or may not seem like the most geometrically intuitive choice, but it has the advantage of making most of the deﬁnitions of geometric objects on a manifold with boundary look exactly the same as those on a manifold.
First, we need to relate the tangent spaces TaHn and TaRn for points a 2 @Hn. Since Hn is not an open subset of Rn, Proposition 3.9 does not apply. As a substitute, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 3.11. Let ÃW Hn ,! Rn denote the inclusion map. For any a 2 @Hn, the differential d Ãa W TaHn ! TaRn is an isomorphism.
Proof. Suppose a 2 @Hn. To show that d Ãa is injective, assume d Ãa.v/ D 0. Suppose f W Hn ! R is smooth, and let fz be any extension of f to a smooth function deﬁned on all of Rn. (Such an extension exists by the extension lemma for smooth

58

functions, Lemma 2.26.) Then fz ı Ã D f , so

vf D v fz ı Ã D d Ãa.v/fz D 0;

which implies that d Ãa is injective. To show surjectivity, let w 2 TaRn be arbitrary. Deﬁne v 2 TaHn by
vf D wfz;

where fz is any smooth extension of f . Writing w D wi @=@xi ja in terms of the standard basis for TaRn, this means that

vf

@fz @xi

.a/:

This is independent of the choice of fz, because by continuity the derivatives of fz at a are determined by those of f in Hn. It is easy to check that v is a derivation at
a and that w D d Ãa.v/, so d Ãa is surjective.

Just as we use Proposition 3.9 to identify TpU with TpM when U is an open subset of M; we use this lemma to identify TaHn with TaRn when a 2 @Hn, and we do not distinguish notationally between an element of TaHn and its image in Ta Rn .

Proposition 3.12 (Dimension of Tangent Spaces on a Manifold with Boundary). Suppose M is an n-dimensional smooth manifold with boundary. For each p 2 M; TpM is an n-dimensional vector space.

Proof. Let p 2 M be arbitrary. If p is an interior point, then because Int M is
an open submanifold of M; Proposition 3.9 implies that Tp.Int M / Š TpM . Since Int M is a smooth n-manifold without boundary, its tangent spaces all have dimen-
sion n.
On the other hand, if p 2 @M; let .U; '/ be a smooth boundary chart containing p, and let Uy D '.U / Â Hn. There are isomorphisms TpM Š TpU (by Proposition 3.9); TpU Š T'.p/Uy (by Proposition 3.6(d), because ' is a diffeomorphism); T'.p/Uy Š T'.p/Hn (by Proposition 3.9 again); and T'.p/Hn Š T'.p/Rn (by Lemma 3.11). The result follows.

Recall from Example 1.24 that every ﬁnite-dimensional vector space has a nat-

ural smooth manifold structure that is independent of any choice of basis or norm.

The following proposition shows that the tangent space to a vector space can be

naturally identiﬁed with the vector space itself.

Suppose V is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space and a 2 V . Just as we did earlier

in the case of Rn, for any vector v 2 V , we deﬁne a map Dvja W C 1.V / ! R by

Proposition 3.13 (The Tangent Space to a Vector Space). Suppose V is a ﬁnite-
dimensional vector space with its standard smooth manifold structure. For each point a 2 V , the map v 7! Dvja deﬁned by (3.5) is a canonical isomorphism from V to TaV , such that for any linear map LW V ! W , the following diagram commutes:

(3.6)

Proof. Once we choose a basis for V , we can use the same argument as in the proof of Proposition 3.2 to show that Dvja is indeed a derivation at a, and that the map v 7! Dvja is an isomorphism.
Now suppose LW V ! W is a linear map. Because its components with respect
to any choices of bases for V and W are linear functions of the coordinates, L is
smooth. Unwinding the deﬁnitions and using the linearity of L, we compute

It is important to understand that each isomorphism V Š TaV is canonically deﬁned, independently of any choice of basis (notwithstanding the fact that we used a choice of basis to prove that it is an isomorphism). Because of this result, we can routinely identify tangent vectors to a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space with elements of the space itself. More generally, if M is an open submanifold of a vector space V , we can combine our identiﬁcations TpM $ TpV $ V to obtain a canonical identiﬁcation of each tangent space to M with V . For example, since GL.n; R/ is an open submanifold of the vector space M.n; R/, we can identify its tangent space at each point X 2 GL.n; R/ with the full space of matrices M.n; R/.
There is another natural identiﬁcation for tangent spaces to a product manifold.

Proposition 3.14 (The Tangent Space to a Product Manifold). Let M1; : : : ; Mk

be smooth manifolds, and for each j , let j W M1

Mk ! Mj be the projection

onto the Mj factor. For any point p D .p1; : : : ; pk/ 2 M1

is an isomorphism. The same is true if one of the spaces Mi is a smooth manifold with boundary.

Proof. See Problem 3-2.

Fig. 3.5 Tangent vectors in coordinates
Once again, because the isomorphism (3.7) is canonically deﬁned, independently of any choice of coordinates, we can consider it as a canonical identiﬁcation, and we will always do so. Thus, for example, we identify T.p;q/.M N / with TpM ˚ TqN , and treat TpM and TqN as subspaces of T.p;q/.M N /.

Computations in Coordinates

Our treatment of the tangent space to a manifold so far might seem hopelessly ab-

stract. To bring it down to earth, we will show how to do computations with tangent

vectors and differentials in local coordinates.

First, suppose M is a smooth manifold (without boundary), and let .U; '/ be

a smooth coordinate chart on M . Then ' is, in particular, a diffeomorphism from U to an open subset Uy Â Rn. Combining Propositions 3.9 and 3.6(d), we see that

d'p W TpM ! T'.p/Rn is an isomorphism. By Corollary 3.3, the derivations @=@x1j'.p/; : : : ; @=@xnj'.p/ form a basis for
T'.p/Rn. Therefore, the preimages of these vectors under the isomorphism d'p
form a basis for TpM (Fig. 3.5). In keeping with our standard practice of treating coordinate maps as identiﬁcations whenever possible, we use the notation @=@xi jp

for these vectors, characterized by either of the following expressions:

@ @xi

where fy D f ı ' 1 is the coordinate representation of f , and py D p1; : : : ; pn D '.p/ is the coordinate representation of p. In other words, @=@xi jp is just the deriva-
tion that takes the i th partial derivative of (the coordinate representation of) f at (the coordinate representation of) p. The vectors @=@xi jp are called the coordinate vec-
tors at p associated with the given coordinate system. In the special case of standard coordinates on Rn, the vectors @=@xi jp are literally the partial derivative operators.

Computations in Coordinates

61

When M is a smooth manifold with boundary and p is an interior point, the
discussion above applies verbatim. For p 2 @M; the only change that needs to be made is to substitute Hn for Rn, with the understanding that the notation @=@xi j'.p/ can be used interchangeably to denote either an element of T'.p/Rn or an element of T'.p/Hn, in keeping with our convention of considering the isomorphism d Ã'.p/ W T'.p/Hn ! T'.p/Rn as an identiﬁcation. The nth coordinate vector @=@xnjp should be interpreted as a one-sided derivative in this case.
The following proposition summarizes the discussion so far.

Proposition 3.15. Let M be a smooth n-manifold with or without boundary, and
let p 2 M . Then TpM is an n-dimensional vector space, and for any smooth chart U; xi containing p, the coordinate vectors @=@x1jp; : : : ; @=@xnjp form a basis for TpM .

Thus, a tangent vector v 2 TpM can be written uniquely as a linear combination

v

where we use the summation convention as usual, with an upper index in the denom-

inator being considered as a lower index, as explained on p. 52. The ordered basis

@=@xi jp is called a coordinate basis for T pM , and the numbers v1; : : : ; vn are

called the components of v with respect to the coordinate basis. If v is known, its

components can be computed easily from its action on the coordinate functions. For

each j , the components of v are given by vj D v xj (where we think of xj as a

smooth real-valued function on U ), because

The Differential in Coordinates

Next we explore how differentials look in coordinates. We begin by considering the special case of a smooth map F W U ! V , where U Â Rn and V Â Rm are

open subsets of Euclidean spaces. For any p 2 U , we will determine the ma-
trix of dFp W TpRn ! TF .p/Rm in terms of the standard coordinate bases. Using x1; : : : ; xn to denote the coordinates in the domain and y1; : : : ; ym to denote

those in the codomain, we use the chain rule to compute the action of dFp on a typical basis vector as follows:

(Recall that the columns of the matrix are the components of the images of the

basis vectors.) This matrix is none other than the Jacobian matrix of F at p,

which is the matrix representation of the total derivative DF .p/W Rn ! Rm. There-

fore, in this case, dFp W TpRn ! TF .p/Rm corresponds to the total derivative DF .p/W Rn ! Rm, under our usual identiﬁcation of Euclidean spaces with their

tangent spaces. The same calculation applies if U is an open subset of Hn and V is

an open subset of Hm.

Now consider the more general case of a smooth map F W M ! N between

smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Choosing smooth coordinate charts

.U; '/ for M containing p and .V; / for N containing F .p/, we obtain the coordinate representation Fy D ı F ı ' 1 W '.U \ F 1.V // ! .V / (Fig. 3.6). Let

py D '.p/ denote the coordinate representation of p. By the computation above, d Fypy is represented with respect to the standard coordinate bases by the Jacobian matrix of Fy at py. Using the fact that F ı ' 1 D 1 ı Fy, we compute

(3.10)

Thus, dFp is represented in coordinate bases by the Jacobian matrix of (the coordinate representative of) F . In fact, the deﬁnition of the differential was cooked up precisely to give a coordinate-independent meaning to the Jacobian matrix.
In the differential geometry literature, the differential is sometimes called the tangent map, the total derivative, or simply the derivative of F . Because it “pushes” tangent vectors forward from the domain manifold to the codomain, it is also called the (pointwise) pushforward. Different authors denote it by symbols such as

F 0.p/; DF; DF .p/; F ; TF; TpF:

We will stick with the notation dFp for the differential of a smooth map between manifolds, and reserve DF .p/ for the total derivative of a map between ﬁnitedimensional vector spaces, which in the case of Euclidean spaces we identify with the Jacobian matrix of F .

Change of Coordinates

Suppose .U; '/ and .V; / are two smooth charts on M; and p 2 U \ V . Let us denote the coordinate functions of ' by xi and those of by xzi . Any tangent vector at p can be represented with respect to either basis @=@xi jp or @=@xzi jp . How are the two representations related?
In this situation, it is customary to write the transition map ı' 1 W '.U \V / !
.U \ V / in the following shorthand notation:

ı ' 1.x/ D xz1.x/; : : : ; xzn.x/ :

Here we are indulging in a typical abuse of notation: in the expression xzi .x/, we think of xzi as a coordinate function (whose domain is an open subset of M; identiﬁed with an open subset of Rn or Hn); but we think of x as representing a point (in this case, in '.U \ V /). By (3.9), the differential d ı ' 1 '.p/ can be written

One important fact to bear in mind is that each coordinate vector @=@xi jp depends on the entire coordinate system, not just on the single coordinate function xi . Geometrically, this reﬂects the fact that @=@xi jp is the derivation obtained by differentiating with respect to xi while all the other coordinates are held constant. If the coordinate functions other than xi are changed, then the direction of this coordinate
derivative can change. The next exercise illustrates how this can happen.

The Tangent Bundle

Often it is useful to consider the set of all tangent vectors at all points of a mani-

fold. Given a smooth manifold M with or without boundary, we deﬁne the tangent

bundle of M , denoted by TM; to be the disjoint union of the tangent spaces at all

points of M :

a TM D TpM:

p2M

We usually write an element of this disjoint union as an ordered pair .p; v/, with p 2 M and v 2 TpM (instead of putting the point p in the second position, as elements of a disjoint union are more commonly written). The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural projection map W TM ! M; which sends each vector in TpM to the point p at which it is tangent: .p; v/ D p. We will often commit the usual mild sin of identifying TpM with its image under the canonical injection v 7! .p; v/, and will use any of the notations .p; v/, vp, and v for a tangent vector in TpM; depending on how much emphasis we wish to give to the point p.

Fig. 3.8 Coordinates for the tangent bundle

For example, in the special case M D Rn, using Proposition 3.2, we see that the

tangent bundle of Rn can be canonically identiﬁed with the union of its geometric

tangent spaces, which in turn is just the Cartesian product of Rn with itself:

a

a

T Rn D

TaRn Š

Rna D

fag Rn D Rn Rn:

a2Rn

a2Rn

a2Rn

An element .a; v/ of this Cartesian product can be thought of as representing either the geometric tangent vector va or the derivation Dvja deﬁned by (3.1). Be warned, however, that in general the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold cannot be identiﬁed in any natural way with a Cartesian product, because there is no canonical way to identify tangent spaces at different points with each other. We will have more to say about this below.
If M is a smooth manifold, the tangent bundle TM can be thought of simply as a disjoint union of vector spaces; but it is much more than that. The next proposition shows that TM can be considered as a smooth manifold in its own right.

Proposition 3.18. For any smooth n-manifold M; the tangent bundle TM has a natural topology and smooth structure that make it into a 2n-dimensional smooth manifold. With respect to this structure, the projection W TM ! M is smooth.

Proof. We begin by deﬁning the maps that will become our smooth charts. Given

any smooth chart .U; '/ for M; note that 1.U / Â TM is the set of all tangent

vectors to M at all points of U . Let x1; : : : ; xn denote the coordinate functions

of ', and deﬁne a map 'zW 1.U / ! R2n by

(i)–(iv) of the smooth manifold chart lemma (Lemma 1.35). To check the Haus-

dorff condition (v), just note that any two points in the same ﬁber of lie in one

chart, while if .p; v/ and .q; w/ lie in different ﬁbers, there exist disjoint smooth coordinate domains U , V for M such that p 2 U and q 2 V , and then 1.U /

respectively.

To see that is smooth, note that with respect to charts .U; '/ for M and 1.U /; 'z for TM; its coordinate representation is .x; v/ D x.

The coordinates xi ; vi given by (3.13) are called natural coordinates on TM .

I Exercise 3.19. Suppose M is a smooth manifold with boundary. Show that TM
has a natural topology and smooth structure making it into a smooth manifold with boundary, such that if U; xi is any smooth boundary chart for M; then rearranging the coordinates in the natural chart 1.U /; xi ; vi for TM yields a boundary chart
1.U /; vi ; xi .

Proposition 3.20. If M is a smooth n-manifold with or without boundary, and M can be covered by a single smooth chart, then TM is diffeomorphic to M Rn.
Proof. If .U; '/ is a global smooth chart for M; then ' is, in particular, a diffeomorphism from U D M to an open subset Uy Â Rn or Hn. The proof of the previous proposition showed that the natural coordinate chart 'z is a bijection from TM to Uy Rn, and the smooth structure on TM is deﬁned essentially by declaring 'z to be a diffeomorphism.
Although the picture of a product U Rn is a useful way to visualize the smooth structure on a tangent bundle locally as in Fig. 3.8, do not be misled into imagining that every tangent bundle is globally diffeomorphic (or even homeomorphic) to a product of the manifold with Rn. This is not the case for most smooth manifolds. We will revisit this question in Chapters 8, 10, and 16.

3 Tangent Vectors

By putting together the differentials of F at all points of M; we obtain a globally deﬁned map between tangent bundles, called the global differential or global tangent map and denoted by dF W TM ! T N . This is just the map whose restriction to each tangent space TpM Â TM is dFp. When we apply the differential of F to a speciﬁc vector v 2 TpM; we can write either dFp.v/ or dF .v/, depending on how much emphasis we wish to give to the point p. The former notation is more informative, while the second is more concise.
One important feature of the smooth structure we have deﬁned on TM is that it makes the differential of a smooth map into a smooth map between tangent bundles.

Proposition 3.21. If F W M ! N is a smooth map, then its global differential dF W TM ! T N is a smooth map.

Proof. From the local expression (3.9) for dFp in coordinates, it follows that dF

has the following coordinate representation in terms of natural coordinates for TM

and T N :

This is smooth because F is.

The following properties of the global differential follow immediately from Proposition 3.6.

Corollary 3.22 (Properties of the Global Differential). Suppose F W M ! N and G W N ! P are smooth maps.

(a) d.G ı F / D dG ı dF .
(b) d.IdM / D IdTM . (c) If F is a diffeomorphism, then dF W TM ! T N is also a diffeomorphism, and
.dF / 1 D d F 1 .

Because of part (c) of this corollary, when F is a diffeomorphism we can use the notation dF 1 unambiguously to mean either .dF / 1 or d F 1 .

Velocity Vectors of Curves
The velocity of a smooth parametrized curve in Rn is familiar from elementary calculus. It is just the vector whose components are the derivatives of the component functions of the curve. In this section we extend this notion to curves in manifolds.
If M is a manifold with or without boundary, we deﬁne a curve in M to be a continuous map W J ! M; where J Â R is an interval. (Most of the time, we will be interested in curves whose domains are open intervals, but for some purposes it is useful to allow J to have one or two endpoints; the deﬁnitions all make sense with minor modiﬁcations in that case, either by considering J as a manifold with boundary or by interpreting derivatives as one-sided derivatives.) Note that in this

book the term curve always refers to a map from an interval into M (a parametrized

curve), not just a set of points in M .

Now let M be a smooth manifold, still with or without boundary. Our deﬁnition

of tangent spaces leads to a natural interpretation of velocity vectors: given a smooth

curve W J ! M and t0 2 J , we deﬁne the velocity of at t0 (Fig. 3.9), denoted

by 0.t0/, to be the vector

In other words, 0.t0/ is the derivation at .t0/ obtained by taking the derivative

of a function along . (If t0 is an endpoint of J , this still holds, provided that we

interpret the derivative with respect to t as a one-sided derivative, or equivalently as

the derivative of any smooth extension of f ı to an open subset of R.)

Now let .U; '/ be a smooth chart with coordinate functions xi . If .t0/ 2 U , we can write the coordinate representation of as .t / D 1.t /; : : : ; n.t / , at least for

This means that 0.t0/ is given by essentially the same formula as it would be in Euclidean space: it is the tangent vector whose components in a coordinate basis are the derivatives of the component functions of .
The next proposition shows that every tangent vector on a manifold is the velocity vector of some curve. This gives a different and somewhat more geometric way to

70

3 Tangent Vectors

think about the tangent bundle: it is just the set of all velocity vectors of smooth curves in M .

Proposition 3.23. Suppose M is a smooth manifold with or without boundary and p 2 M . Every v 2 TpM is the velocity of some smooth curve in M .

Proof. First suppose that p 2 Int M (which includes the case @M D ¿). Let .U; '/ be a smooth coordinate chart centered at p, and write v D vi @=@xi jp in terms of the coordinate basis. For sufﬁciently small " > 0, let W . "; "/ ! U be the curve
whose coordinate representation is

.t / D t v1; : : : ; t vn :

(3.14)

(Remember, this really means .t / D ' 1 t v1; : : : ; t vn .) This is a smooth curve
with .0/ D p, and the computation above shows that 0.0/ D vi @=@xi j .0/ D v.
Now suppose p 2 @M . Let .U; '/ be a smooth boundary chart centered at p, and write v D vi @=@xi jp as before. We wish to let be the curve whose coordinate representation is (3.14), but this formula represents a point of M only when tvn 0.
We can accommodate this requirement by suitably restricting the domain of : if vn D 0, we deﬁne W . "; "/ ! U as before; if vn > 0, we let the domain be Œ0; "/; and if vn < 0, we let it be . "; 0. In each case, is a smooth curve in M with
.0/ D p and 0.0/ D v.

The next proposition shows that velocity vectors behave well under composition with smooth maps.

Proposition 3.24 (The Velocity of a Composite Curve). Let F W M ! N be a smooth map, and let W J ! M be a smooth curve. For any t0 2 J , the velocity at t D t0 of the composite curve F ı W J ! N is given by
.F ı /0.t0/ D dF 0.t0/ :

On the face of it, the preceding proposition tells us how to compute the velocity of a composite curve in terms of the differential. However, it is often much more useful to turn it around the other way, and use it as a streamlined way to compute differentials. Suppose F W M ! N is a smooth map, and we need to compute the differential dFp at some point p 2 M . We can compute dFp.v/ for any v 2 TpM by choosing a smooth curve whose initial tangent vector is v, and then applying Proposition 3.23 to the composite curve F ı . The next corollary summarizes the result.

Corollary 3.25 (Computing the Differential Using a Velocity Vector). Suppose F W M ! N is a smooth map, p 2 M; and v 2 TpM . Then
dFp.v/ D .F ı /0.0/
for any smooth curve W J ! M such that 0 2 J , .0/ D p, and 0.0/ D v.

Alternative Deﬁnitions of the Tangent Space

71

This corollary frequently yields a much more succinct computation of dF , especially if F is presented in some form other than an explicit coordinate representation. We will see many examples of this technique in later chapters.

Alternative Deﬁnitions of the Tangent Space
In the literature you will ﬁnd tangent vectors to a smooth manifold deﬁned in several different ways. Here we describe the most common ones. (Yet another deﬁnition is suggested in the remark following Problem 11-4.) It is good to be conversant with all of them. Throughout this section, M represents an arbitrary smooth manifold with or without boundary.

Tangent Vectors as Derivations of the Space of Germs

The most common alternative deﬁnition is based on the notion of “germs” of smooth functions, which we now deﬁne.
A smooth function element on M is an ordered pair .f; U /, where U is an open subset of M and f W U ! R is a smooth function. Given a point p 2 M; let us deﬁne an equivalence relation on the set of all smooth function elements whose domains contain p by setting .f; U / .g; V / if f Á g on some neighborhood of p. The equivalence class of a function element .f; U / is called the germ of f at p. The set of all germs of smooth functions at p is denoted by Cp1.M /. It is a real vector space and an associative algebra under the operations

c .f; U / D .cf; U / ; .f; U / C .g; V / D .f C g; U \ V / ;
.f; U / .g; V / D .fg; U \ V / :

(The zero element of this algebra is the equivalence class of the zero function on M .)

Let us denote the germ at p of the function element .f; U / simply by Œf p; there is

no need to include the domain U in the notation, because the same germ is repre-

sented by the restriction of f to any neighborhood of p. To say that two germs Œf p

and Œgp are equal is simply to say that f Á g on some neighborhood of p, however

small.

It is common to deﬁne the tangent space to M at p as the vector space DpM of derivations of Cp1.M /. Thanks to Proposition 3.8, it is a simple matter to prove that DpM is naturally isomorphic to the tangent space as we have deﬁned it (see
Problem 3-7).

3 Tangent Vectors

The germ deﬁnition has a number of advantages. One of the most signiﬁcant is that it makes the local nature of the tangent space clearer, without requiring the use of bump functions. Because there do not exist analytic bump functions, the germ deﬁnition of tangent vectors is the only one available on real-analytic or complexanalytic manifolds. The chief disadvantage of the germ approach is simply that it adds an additional level of complication to an already highly abstract deﬁnition.

Tangent Vectors as Equivalence Classes of Curves
Another common approach to tangent vectors is to deﬁne an intrinsic equivalence relation on the set of smooth curves with the same starting point, which captures the idea of “having the same velocity,” and to deﬁne a tangent vector as an equivalence class of curves. Here we describe one such equivalence relation.
Suppose p is a point of M . We wish to deﬁne an equivalence relation on the set of all smooth curves of the form W J ! M; where J is an interval containing 0 and .0/ D p. Given two such curves 1 W J1 ! M and 2 W J2 ! M; let us say that 1 2 if .f ı 1/0.0/ D .f ı 2/0.0/ for every smooth real-valued function f deﬁned in a neighborhood of p. Let VpM denote the set of equivalence classes. The tangent space to M at p is often deﬁned to be the set VpM .
Using this deﬁnition, it is very easy to deﬁne the differential of a smooth map F W M ! N as the map that sends Œ  2 VpM to ŒF ı  2 VF .p/N . Velocity vectors of smooth curves are almost as easy to deﬁne. Suppose W J ! M is any smooth curve. If 0 2 J , then the velocity of at 0 is just the equivalence class of in V .0/M . The velocity at any other point t0 2 J can be deﬁned as the equivalence class in V .t0/M of the curve t0 deﬁned by t0 .t / D .t0 C t /.
Problem 3-8 shows that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between VpM and TpM . This deﬁnition has the advantage of being geometrically more intuitive, but it has the serious drawback that the existence of a vector space structure on VpM is not at all obvious.

Tangent Vectors as Equivalence Classes of n-Tuples
Yet another approach to deﬁning the tangent space is based on the transformation rule (3.12) for the components of tangent vectors in coordinates. One deﬁnes a tangent vector at a point p 2 M to be a rule that assigns an ordered n-tuple v1; : : : ; vn 2 Rn to each smooth coordinate chart containing p, with the property that the n-tuples assigned to overlapping charts transform according to (3.12). (This is, in fact, the oldest deﬁnition of all, and many physicists are still apt to think of tangent vectors this way.)
In this approach, the velocity of a curve is deﬁned by the usual Euclidean formula in coordinates, and the differential of F W M ! N is deﬁned as the linear map determined by the Jacobian matrix of F in coordinates. One then has to show, by means of tedious computations involving the chain rule, that these operations are well deﬁned, independently of the choices of coordinates.

Categories and Functors

73

It is a matter of individual taste which of the various characterizations of TpM one chooses to take as the deﬁnition. The deﬁnition we have chosen, however abstract it may seem at ﬁrst, has several advantages: it is relatively concrete (tangent vectors are actual derivations of C 1.M /, with no equivalence classes involved); it makes the vector space structure on TpM obvious; and it leads to straightforward coordinate-independent deﬁnitions of differentials, velocities, and many of the other geometric objects we will be studying.

Categories and Functors
Another useful perspective on tangent spaces and differentials is provided by the theory of categories. In this section we summarize the basic deﬁnitions of category theory. We do not do much with the theory in this book, but we mention it because it provides a convenient and powerful language for talking about many of the mathematical structures we will meet.
A category C consists of the following things:
a class Ob.C/, whose elements are called objects of C, a class Hom.C/, whose elements are called morphisms of C, for each morphism f 2 Hom.C/, two objects X; Y 2 Ob.C/ called the source and target of f , respectively, for each triple X; Y; Z 2 Ob.C/, a mapping called composition:
HomC.X; Y / HomC.Y; Z/ ! HomC.X; Z/;
written .f; g/ 7! g ı f , where HomC.X; Y / denotes the class of all morphisms with source X and target Y .
The morphisms are required to satisfy the following axioms:
(i) ASSOCIATIVITY: .f ı g/ ı h D f ı .g ı h/. (ii) EXISTENCE OF IDENTITIES: For each object X 2 Ob.C/, there exists an iden-
tity morphism IdX 2 HomC.X; X /, such that IdY ıf D f D f ı IdX for all f 2 HomC.X; Y /.
A morphism f 2 HomC.X; Y / is called an isomorphism in C if there exists a morphism g 2 HomC.Y; X / such that f ı g D IdY and g ı f D IdX .
Example 3.26 (Categories). In most of the categories that one meets “in nature,” the objects are sets with some extra structure, the morphisms are maps that preserve that structure, and the composition laws and identity morphisms are the obvious ones. Some of the categories of this type that appear in this book (implicitly or explicitly) are listed below. In each case, we describe the category by giving its objects and its morphisms.

There are also important categories whose objects are sets with distinguished
base points, in addition to (possibly) other structures. A pointed set is an ordered
pair .X; p/, where X is a set and p is an element of X . Other pointed objects such
as pointed topological spaces or pointed smooth manifolds are deﬁned similarly. If .X; p/ and .X 0; p0/ are pointed sets (or topological spaces, etc.), a map F W X ! X0 is said to be a pointed map if F .p/ D p0; in this case, we write F W .X; p/ ! .X0; p0/. Here are some important examples of categories of pointed objects.

Set : pointed sets and pointed maps

Top : pointed topological spaces and pointed continuous maps

Man : pointed topological manifolds and pointed continuous maps

Diff : pointed smooth manifolds and pointed smooth maps

//

We use the word class instead of set for the collections of objects and morphisms in a category because in some categories they are “too large” to be considered sets. For example, in the category Set, Ob.Set/ is the class of all sets; any attempt to treat it as a set in its own right leads to the well-known Russell paradox of set theory. (See [LeeTM, Appendix A] or almost any book on set theory for more.) Even though the classes of objects and morphisms might not constitute sets, we still use notations such as X 2 Ob.C/ and f 2 Hom.C/ to indicate that X is an object and f is a morphism in C. A category in which both Ob.C/ and Hom.C/ are sets is called a small category, and one in which each class of morphisms HomC.X; Y / is a set is called locally small. All the categories listed above are locally small but not small.
If C and D are categories, a covariant functor from C to D is a rule F that assigns to each object X 2 Ob.C/ an object F .X/ 2 Ob.D/, and to each morphism f 2 HomC.X; Y / a morphism F .f / 2 HomD.F .X /; F .Y //, so that identities and composition are preserved:

F .IdX / D IdF .X/I F .g ı h/ D F .g/ ı F .h/:

We also need to consider functors that reverse morphisms: a contravariant functor from C to D is a rule F that assigns to each object X 2 Ob.C/ an object F .X / 2 Ob.D/, and to each morphism f 2 HomC.X; Y / a morphism F .f / 2 HomD.F .Y /; F .X //, such that

F .IdX / D IdF .X/I F .g ı h/ D F .h/ ı F .g/:

I Exercise 3.27. Show that any (covariant or contravariant) functor from C to D takes isomorphisms in C to isomorphisms in D.

Problems

75

One trivial example of a covariant functor is the identity functor from any category to itself: it takes each object and each morphism to itself. Another example is the forgetful functor: if C is a category whose objects are sets with some additional structure and whose morphisms are maps preserving that structure (as are all the categories listed in the ﬁrst part of Example 3.26 except Set itself), the forgetful functor F W C ! Set assigns to each object its underlying set, and to each morphism the same map thought of as a map between sets.
More interesting functors arise when we associate “invariants” to classes of mathematical objects. For example, the fundamental group is a covariant functor from Top to Grp. The results of Problem 2-10 show that there is a contravariant functor from Diff to VecR deﬁned by assigning to each smooth manifold M the vector space C 1.M /, and to each smooth map F W M ! N the linear map F W C 1.N / ! C 1.M / deﬁned by F .f / D f ı F .
The discussion in this chapter has given us some other important examples of functors. First, the tangent space functor is a covariant functor from the category Diff of pointed smooth manifolds to the category VecR of real vector spaces. To each pointed smooth manifold .M; p/ it assigns the tangent space TpM; and to each pointed smooth map F W .M; p/ ! .N; F .p// it assigns the differential dFp. The fact that this is a functor is the content of parts (b) and (c) of Proposition 3.6.
Similarly, we can think of the assignments M 7! TM and F 7! dF (sending each smooth manifold to its tangent bundle and each smooth map to its global differential) as a covariant functor from Diff to itself, called the tangent functor.

Chapter 4
Submersions, Immersions, and Embeddings

Because the differential of a smooth map is supposed to represent the “best linear approximation” to the map near a given point, we can learn a great deal about a map by studying linear-algebraic properties of its differential. The most essential property of the differential—in fact, just about the only property that can be deﬁned independently of choices of bases—is its rank (the dimension of its image).
In this chapter we undertake a detailed study of the ways in which geometric properties of smooth maps can be detected from their differentials. The maps for which differentials give good local models turn out to be the ones whose differentials have constant rank. Three categories of such maps play special roles: smooth submersions (whose differentials are surjective everywhere), smooth immersions (whose differentials are injective everywhere), and smooth embeddings (injective smooth immersions that are also homeomorphisms onto their images). Smooth immersions and embeddings, as we will see in the next chapter, are essential ingredients in the theory of submanifolds, while smooth submersions play a role in smooth manifold theory closely analogous to the role played by quotient maps in topology.
The engine that powers this discussion is the rank theorem, a corollary of the inverse function theorem. In the ﬁrst section of the chapter, we prove the rank theorem and some of its important consequences. Then we delve more deeply into smooth embeddings and smooth submersions, and apply the theory to a particularly useful class of smooth submersions, the smooth covering maps.

Maps of Constant Rank

The key linear-algebraic property of a linear map is its rank. In fact, as Theorem B.20 shows, the rank is the only property that distinguishes different linear maps if we are free to choose bases independently for the domain and codomain.
Suppose M and N are smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Given a smooth map F W M ! N and a point p 2 M; we deﬁne the rank of F at p to be the rank of the linear map dFp W TpM ! TF .p/N ; it is the rank of the Jacobian matrix

of F in any smooth chart, or the dimension of Im dFp Â TF .p/N . If F has the same rank r at every point, we say that it has constant rank, and write rank F D r.
Because the rank of a linear map is never higher than the dimension of either its domain or its codomain (Exercise B.22), the rank of F at each point is bounded above by the minimum of fdim M; dim N g. If the rank of dFp is equal to this upper bound, we say that F has full rank at p, and if F has full rank everywhere, we say F has full rank.
The most important constant-rank maps are those of full rank. A smooth map F W M ! N is called a smooth submersion if its differential is surjective at each point (or equivalently, if rank F D dim N ). It is called a smooth immersion if its differential is injective at each point (equivalently, rank F D dim M ).
Proposition 4.1. Suppose F W M ! N is a smooth map and p 2 M . If dFp is surjective, then p has a neighborhood U such that F jU is a submersion. If dFp is injective, then p has a neighborhood U such that F jU is an immersion.
Proof. If we choose any smooth coordinates for M near p and for N near F .p/, either hypothesis means that Jacobian matrix of F in coordinates has full rank at p. Example 1.28 shows that the set of m n matrices of full rank is an open subset of M.m n; R/ (where m D dim M and n D dim N ), so by continuity, the Jacobian of F has full rank in some neighborhood of p.

As we will see in this chapter, smooth submersions and immersions behave locally like surjective and injective linear maps, respectively. (There are also analogous notions of topological submersions and topological immersions, which apply to maps that are merely continuous. We do not have any need to use these, but for the sake of completeness, we describe them later in the chapter.)

Example 4.2 (Submersions and Immersions).

(a) Suppose M1; : : : ; Mk are smooth manifolds. Then each of the projection maps

i W M1

Mk ! Mi is a smooth submersion. In particular, the projection

W RnCk ! Rn onto the ﬁrst n coordinates is a smooth submersion.

(b) If W J ! M is a smooth curve in a smooth manifold M with or without boundary, then is a smooth immersion if and only if 0.t/ ¤ 0 for all t 2 J .

(c) If M is a smooth manifold and its tangent bundle TM is given the smooth

manifold structure described in Proposition 3.18, the projection W TM ! M

is a smooth submersion. To verify this, just note that with respect to any smooth local coordinates xi on an open subset U Â M and the corresponding natural

coordinates xi ; vi on 1.U / Â TM (see Proposition 3.18), the coordinate

representation of is y.x; v/ D x. (d) The smooth map X W R2 ! R3 given by

X.u; v/ D .2 C cos 2 u/ cos 2 v; .2 C cos 2 u/ sin 2 v; sin 2 u

is a smooth immersion of R2 into R3 whose image is the doughnut-shaped

surface obtained by revolving the circle .y 2/2 C z2 D 1 in the .y; z/-plane

about the z-axis (Fig. 4.1).

I Exercise 4.4. Show that a composition of smooth submersions is a smooth submersion, and a composition of smooth immersions is a smooth immersion. Give a counterexample to show that a composition of maps of constant rank need not have constant rank.
Local Diffeomorphisms
If M and N are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, a map F W M ! N is called a local diffeomorphism if every point p 2 M has a neighborhood U such that F .U / is open in N and F jU W U ! F .U / is a diffeomorphism. The next theorem is the key to the most important properties of local diffeomorphisms.
Theorem 4.5 (Inverse Function Theorem for Manifolds). Suppose M and N are smooth manifolds, and F W M ! N is a smooth map. If p 2 M is a point such that dFp is invertible, then there are connected neighborhoods U0 of p and V0 of F .p/ such that F jU0 W U0 ! V0 is a diffeomorphism.
Proof. The fact that dFp is bijective implies that M and N have the same dimension, say n. Choose smooth charts .U; '/ centered at p and .V; / centered at F .p/, with F .U / Â V . Then Fy D ı F ı ' 1 is a smooth map from the open subset Uy D '.U / Â Rn into Vy D .V / Â Rn, with Fy.p/ D 0. Because ' and are diffeomorphisms, the differential d Fy0 D d F .p/ ı dFp ı d ' 1 0 is nonsingular. The ordinary inverse function theorem (Theorem C.34) shows that there are connected open subsets Uy0 Â Uy and Vy0 Â Vy containing 0 such that Fy restricts to a diffeomorphism from Uy0 to Vy0. Then U0 D ' 1 Uy0 and V0 D 1 Vy0 are connected neighborhoods of p and F .p/, respectively, and it follows by composition that F jU0 is a diffeomorphism from U0 to V0.
It is important to notice that we have stated Theorem 4.5 only for manifolds without boundary. In fact, it can fail for a map whose domain has nonempty boundary (see Problem 4-1). However, when the codomain has nonempty boundary, there is something useful that can be said: provided the map takes its values in the interior of the codomain, the same conclusion holds because the interior is a smooth manifold

without boundary. Problem 4-2 shows that this is always the case at points where the differential is invertible.
Proposition 4.6 (Elementary Properties of Local Diffeomorphisms).
(a) Every composition of local diffeomorphisms is a local diffeomorphism. (b) Every ﬁnite product of local diffeomorphisms between smooth manifolds is a
local diffeomorphism. (c) Every local diffeomorphism is a local homeomorphism and an open map. (d) The restriction of a local diffeomorphism to an open submanifold with or with-
out boundary is a local diffeomorphism. (e) Every diffeomorphism is a local diffeomorphism. (f) Every bijective local diffeomorphism is a diffeomorphism. (g) A map between smooth manifolds with or without boundary is a local diffeo-
morphism if and only if in a neighborhood of each point of its domain, it has a coordinate representation that is a local diffeomorphism.
I Exercise 4.7. Prove the preceding proposition.
Proposition 4.8. Suppose M and N are smooth manifolds (without boundary), and F W M ! N is a map.
(a) F is a local diffeomorphism if and only if it is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion.
(b) If dim M D dim N and F is either a smooth immersion or a smooth submersion, then it is a local diffeomorphism.
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that F is a local diffeomorphism. Given p 2 M; there is a neighborhood U of p such that F is a diffeomorphism from U to F .U /. It then follows from Proposition 3.6(d) that dFp W TpM ! TF .p/N is an isomorphism. Thus rank F D dim M D dim N , so F is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion. Conversely, if F is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion, then dFp is an isomorphism at each p 2 M; and the inverse function theorem for manifolds (Theorem 4.5) shows that p has a neighborhood on which F restricts to a diffeomorphism onto its image. This proves (a).
To prove (b), note that if M and N have the same dimension, then either injectivity or surjectivity of dFp implies bijectivity, so F is a smooth submersion if and only if it is a smooth immersion, and thus (b) follows from (a).
I Exercise 4.9. Show that the conclusions of Proposition 4.8 still hold if N is allowed to be a smooth manifold with boundary, but not if M is. (See Problems 4-1 and 4-2.)
I Exercise 4.10. Suppose M; N , P are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and F W M ! N is a local diffeomorphism. Prove the following:
(a) If G W P ! M is continuous, then G is smooth if and only if F ı G is smooth. (b) If in addition F is surjective and G W N ! P is any map, then G is smooth if and
only if G ı F is smooth.

Maps of Constant Rank

Example 4.11 (Local Diffeomorphisms). The map "W R ! S1 deﬁned in Exam-

ple 2.13(b) is a local diffeomorphism because in a neighborhood of each point it

has a coordinate representation of the form t 7! 2 t C c, which is a local diffeo-

morphism. Similarly, the map "n W Rn ! T n deﬁned in Example 2.13(c) is a local

diffeomorphism because it is a product of local diffeomorphisms.

At the end of this chapter, we will explore an important special class of local diffeomorphisms, the smooth covering maps.

The Rank Theorem

The most important fact about constant-rank maps is the following consequence of the inverse function theorem, which says that a constant-rank smooth map can be placed locally into a particularly simple canonical form by a change of coordinates. It is a nonlinear version of the canonical form theorem for linear maps given in Theorem B.20.

Theorem 4.12 (Rank Theorem). Suppose M and N are smooth manifolds of dimensions m and n, respectively, and F W M ! N is a smooth map with constant rank r. For each p 2 M there exist smooth charts .U; '/ for M centered at p and .V; / for N centered at F .p/ such that F .U / Â V , in which F has a coordinate representation of the form

Fy x1; : : : ; xr ; xrC1; : : : ; xm D x1; : : : ; xr ; 0; : : : ; 0 :

(4.1)

In particular, if F is a smooth submersion, this becomes

Fy x1; : : : ; xn; xnC1; : : : ; xm D x1; : : : ; xn ;

(4.2)

and if F is a smooth immersion, it is

Fy x1; : : : ; xm D x1; : : : ; xm; 0; : : : ; 0 :

(4.3)

Proof. Because the theorem is local, after choosing smooth coordinates we can replace M and N by open subsets U Â Rm and V Â Rn. The fact that DF .p/ has
rank r implies that its matrix has some r r submatrix with nonzero determinant.
By reordering the coordinates, we may assume that it is the upper left submatrix, @F i =@xj for i; j D 1; : : : ; r . Let us relabel the standard coordinates as .x; y/ D x1; : : : ; xr ; y1; : : : ; ym r in Rm and .v; w/ D v1; : : : ; vr ; w1; : : : ; wn r in Rn.
By initial translations of the coordinates, we may assume without loss of generality
that p D .0; 0/ and F .p/ D .0; 0/. If we write F .x; y/ D Q.x; y/; R.x; y/ for some smooth maps Q W U ! Rr and R W U ! Rn r , then our hypothesis is that @Qi =@xj is nonsingular at .0; 0/.
Deﬁne ' W U ! Rm by '.x; y/ D Q.x; y/; y . Its total derivative at .0; 0/ is

(4.4)

The matrix D'.0; 0/ is nonsingular by virtue of the hypothesis. Therefore, by the inverse function theorem, there are connected neighborhoods U0 of .0; 0/ and Uz0 of '.0; 0/ D .0; 0/ such that ' W U0 ! Uz0 is a diffeomorphism. By shrinking U0 and Uz0 if necessary, we may assume that Uz0 is an open cube. Writing the inverse map as ' 1.x; y/ D A.x; y/; B.x; y/ for some smooth functions AW Uz0 ! Rr
and B W Uz0 ! Rm r , we compute

.x; y/ D ' A.x; y/; B.x; y/ D Q A.x; y/; B.x; y/ ; B.x; y/ :

(4.5)

Comparing y components shows that B.x; y/ D y, and therefore ' 1 has the form

' 1.x; y/ D A.x; y/; y :

On the other hand, ' ı ' 1 D Id implies Q A.x; y/; y D x, and therefore F ı ' 1 has the form
F ı ' 1.x; y/ D x; Rz.x; y/ ;

where Rz W Uz0 ! Rn r is deﬁned by Rz.x; y/ D R A.x; y/; y . The Jacobian matrix of this composite map at an arbitrary point .x; y/ 2 Uz0 is

Since composing with a diffeomorphism does not change the rank of a map, this

matrix has rank r everywhere in Uz0. The ﬁrst r columns are obviously linearly independent, so the rank can be r only if the derivatives @Rzi =@yj vanish identically

on Uz0, which implies that Rz is actually independent of y1; : : : ; ym r . (This is one

reason we arranged for Uz0 to be a cube.) Thus, if we let S.x/ D Rz.x; 0/, then we

have

F ı ' 1.x; y/ D x; S.x/ :

therefore F .U0/ Â V0. Deﬁne W V0 ! Rn by .v; w/ D v; w S.v/ . This

is a diffeomorphism onto its image, because its inverse is given explicitly by
