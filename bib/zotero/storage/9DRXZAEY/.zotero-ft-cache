Abstract It has been observed that the motion planning problem of robotics reduces mathematically to the problem of ﬁnding a section of the path-space ﬁbration, leading to the notion of topological complexity, as introduced by M. Farber. In this approach one imposes no limitations on motion of the system assuming that any continuous motion is admissible. In many applications, however, a physical apparatus may have constrained controls, leading to constraints on its potential dynamics. In the present paper we adapt the notion of topological complexity to the case of directed topological spaces, which encompass such controlled systems, and also systems which appear in concurrency theory. We study properties of this new notion and make calculations for some interesting classes of examples.

1 Introduction
A mechanical system may function autonomously provided it is supplied with a motion planning algorithm. Such an algorithm takes an ordered pair of states (A, B) of the system as input and produces a continuous motion of the system starting at state A and

ending at state B, as output. The notion of topological complexity TC(X ) (introduced in Farber 2003) reﬂects the structure of motion planning algorithms for systems having X as their conﬁguration space. To deﬁne TC(X ) one considers the path space ﬁbration

χ : XI → X × X,

(1)

where χ ( p) = ( p(0), p(1)). The symbol X I denotes the space of all continuous paths p : I → X equipped with the compact-open topology, where I = [0, 1]. A motion planning algorithm is a section of this ﬁbration and it is easy to see that a continuous section exists if and only if the conﬁguration space X is contractible. TC(X ) is deﬁned as the minimal number of continuous “local rules” that are needed to describe a section. The notion of topological complexity is well understood both algorithmically and topologically Farber (2008). One of the key facts is that for a topological space X the integer TC(X ) depends only on the homotopy type of X and in particular TC(X ) = 1 is equivalent for X to be contractible. More information on the concept TC(X ) and its relevance to the robot motion planning problem can be found in Farber (2008).
The goal of this paper is to analyse an analogue of TC(X ) in the realm of directed topological spaces. To motivate our interest in “the directed version” of topological complexity we note that the above deﬁnition of TC(X ) describes the motion planning problem of robotics when we ignore constraints on the actual controls that can be applied to the physical apparatus, i.e. when we assume that any continuous motion of the system is achievable. In many applications, however, a physical apparatus may have dynamics that can be described by an ordinary differential equation in the state variables x ∈ Rn in time t, and parameterised by the control parameters u ∈ Rp,

x˙(t) = f (t, x(t), u(t)).

(2)

The control parameters u(t) are usually restricted to lie within a set U ⊂ Rp. One may thus describe the variety of trajectories of the control system (2) by using the language of differential inclusions,

x˙(t) ∈ F(t, x(t)),

(3)

where F(t, x(t)) is the set of all vectors f (t, x(t), u) with u ∈ U . Under some well-known conditions this differential inclusion has solutions, at least locally. Under these conditions, the set of solutions of the differential inclusion (3) naturally forms a directed space (or a d-space for short) in the sense of Grandis (2009), see also Sect. 2 below. We observe in this paper that the motion planning problem of robotics in the presence of control constraints reduces to the problem of ﬁnding a section to a “directed analogue” of the path space ﬁbration (1). The latter is the map taking a directed path to the pair of its end points; note that this map is typically not a ﬁbration. This material is developed in the following sections. In particular, we introduce the notion of directed homotopy equivalence which helps to describe properties of the directed version of topological complexity.

2 Deﬁnitions

The context of a d-space was introduced in Grandis (2009); we will restrict ourselves later (Sect. 6) to a more convenient category of d-spaces, that ought to be thought of as some kind of coﬁbrant replacement of more general (but sometimes pathological) d-spaces.
Let I = [0, 1] denote the unit segment with the topology inherited from R.
Deﬁnition 1 (Grandis 2009) A directed topological space, or a d-space is a pair (X , d X ) consisting of a topological space X equipped with a subset d X ⊂ X I of continuous paths p : I → X , called directed paths or d-paths, satisfying three axioms:
– every constant map I → X is directed; – d X is closed under composition with continuous non-decreasing maps I → I ; – d X is closed under concatenation.
We shall abbreviate the notation (X , d X ) to X . Note that for a d-space X , the space of d-paths d X ⊂ X I is a topological space, it is equipped with the compact-open topology. A map f : X → Y between d-spaces (X , d X ) and (Y , dY ) is said to be a d-map if it is continuous and for any d-path p ∈ d X the composition f ◦ p : I → Y belongs to dY . In other words we require that f preserves d-paths. We write d f : d X → dY for the induced map between directed paths spaces.
Remark 1 Given a topological space X equipped with a set D of paths p : I → X , closed under concatenation and such that the union of the images p(I ), for p ∈ D is X , we call saturation D of D the smallest set of paths containing D that forms a d-space structure on X . The saturation D is made of all composites of path of D with continuous and non-decreasing maps I → I .
Directed spaces in control theory Consider a differential inclusion

x˙ ∈ F(x)

(4)

where F is a map from Rn to ℘ (Rn), the set of all subsets of Rn. A function x : [0, ∞) → Rn is a solution of inclusion (4) if x is absolutely continuous and for almost all t ∈ R one has x˙(t) ∈ F(x(t)), see Aubin and Cellina (1984). In general, there can be many solutions to a differential inclusion.
Lemma 1 Aubin and Cellina (1984) Suppose a set-valued map F : Rn Rn is an upper semicontinuous function of x and such that the set F(x) is closed and convex for all x. Then there exists a solution to Eq. (4) deﬁned on an open interval of time.
Consider a smooth manifold X and an upper semicontinuous set-valued mapping x → F(x) where for x ∈ X the image F(x) is a convex cone contained in the tangent space to X at point x, i.e. F(x) ⊂ Tx X . Let d X denote the saturation of the set of all solutions to the differential inclusion x˙ ∈ F(x). Then the pair (X , d X ) is a d-space. Directed spaces in concurrency and distributed systems theory The semantics of concurrent and distributed systems can be given in terms of d-spaces, more speciﬁcally in

terms of geometric realizations Fajstrup et al. (2016) of certain pre-cubical sets. As an example, consider the following concurrent program, made of two processes T1, T2, and two binary semaphores a, b, i.e. resources, that can only be locked by one of the two processes at a time, using notation of Fajstrup et al. (2016) : T1 = Pa.V a.Pb.V b, T2 = Pa.V a.Pb.V b. This means that process T1 is locking a (Pa), then relinquishing the lock on a (V a), then locking b (Pb), and ﬁnally relinquishing the lock of b (V b). Process T2 does the same sequence of actions. The semantics of this concurrent program is depicted in Fig. 1 : it is a partially ordered space X , i.e. a topological space with a global order ≤, closed in X × X . Its d-space structure is given by choosing d-paths to be paths p : I → X such that p is non-decreasing. A few of such d-paths are depicted in Fig. 1. The d-paths map In what follows, we will be particularly concerned with the following map :
Deﬁnition 2 Let (X , d X ) be a d-space. Deﬁne the d-paths map
χ : dX → X × X
by χ ( p) = ( p(0), p(1)) where p ∈ d X .
This map is analogous to the classical path-space ﬁbration (1); the essential difference is that in the directed setting χ , as deﬁned above, it is not necessarilly a ﬁbration.
The image of χ is a subset of X × X , denoted
ΓX = {(x, y) ∈ X × X | ∃ p ∈ d X , p(0) = x, p(1) = y }.
Notations For a, b ∈ X , the symbol d X (a, b) will denote the subspace of d X consisting of all d-paths starting at a ∈ X and ending at b ∈ X . We denote by ∗ the concatenation map
d X (a, b) × d X (b, c) → d X (a, c).
Note that d X (a, b) is nonempty if and only if (a, b) ∈ ΓX .

3 Directed topological complexity
Let (X , d X ) be a d-space such that X is a Euclidean Neighbourhood Retract (ENR). Recall that a topological space X is said to be an ENR if it can be embedded into a
Euclidean space X ⊂ RN such that for an open neighbourhood X ⊂ U ⊂ RN there exists a retraction r : U → X , r |X = 1X . It is well-known that a subset X ⊂ RN is an ENR iff it is locally compact and locally contractible. Thus, any ﬁnite dimensional simplicial complex is an ENR. Deﬁnition 3 The directed topological complexity −T→C(X , d X ) of a d-space (X , d X ) is the minimum number n (or ∞ if no such n exists) such that there exists a map s : ΓX → d X (not necessarily continuous) and ΓX can be partitioned into n ENRs
ΓX = F1 ∪ F2 ∪ · · · ∪ Fn, Fi ∩ Fj = ∅, i = j ,
such that
– χ ◦ s = I d, i.e. s is a (non-necessarily continuous) section of χ ; – s|Fi : Fi → d X is continuous. A collection of such ENRs, F1, . . . , Fn, with n equal the directed topological complexity of X is called a patchwork.
Example in control theory As in Farber (2008), a motion planner, for the dynamics described by the differential inclusion (4) is a section of the d-paths map produced by the differential inclusion. A section s : ΓX → d X associates to any pair of points (x, y) ∈ ΓX an “admissible” path s(x, y) = γ ∈ d X with γ (0) = x and γ (1) = y. Such a path γ ∈ d X will automatically be realisable as a solution of (2). Example in concurrency and distributed systems theory Examine again Fig. 1; a section of χ is just a scheduler for the actions of the processes T1 and T2.
In the theory of usual (i.e. undirected) topological complexity Farber (2003), Farber (2008), there are several other equivalent deﬁnitions of TC(X ), for example the topological complexity TC(X ) is also the minimal cardinality of the covering of X × X by open (resp. closed) sets admitting continuous sections; moreover, the book Farber (2008) contains four different deﬁnitions of TC(X ) leading to the equivalent notions of TC(X ). In the directed case, however, the deﬁnitions with open or closed covers lead to notions which can be distinct between themselves as well as distinct from the notion with the ENR partitions given above.

Example 1 Consider the interval I = [0, 1] with the d-structure given by the set of all non-decreasing paths, i.e. p : [0, 1] → [0, 1] such that p(t) ≤ p(t ) for any t ≤ t . The space ΓI is {(x, y)|x ≤ y} and the map χ : dI → ΓI admits a continuous section

s(x, y)(t) = (1 − t)x + t y
where t ∈ [0, 1]. Hence −T→C(I ) = 1. Note that in this example the space ΓI is contractible and the map χ is a ﬁbration
with a contractible ﬁbre.
−→ Example 2 Let us consider the directed circle S1 shown on the ﬁgure below:

b

e

It is a directed graph homeomorphic to the circle S1 which is the union of two directed −→
intervals I+−→∪ I−; the d-paths of S1 are the d-paths lying in one of the intervals I±. We see that P(S1 ) = P(I+) ∪ P(I−) and P(I+) ∩ P(I−) is a 2-point set containing the

two

constant

paths

pb (t )

≡

b

and

pe (t )

≡

e.

Similarly,

one

has

Γ−→
S1

=

ΓI+

∪

ΓI−

and

the intersection ΓI+ ∩ ΓI− is a 3 point set {(b, b), (b, e), (e, e)}. Since each of the sets

ΓI±

is

contractible

we

obtain

that

Γ−→ S1

is

homotopy −→

equivalent

to

the

wedge

S1

∨

S1.

Next we observe that the map χ : d S1 → Γ−→ S1 admits no continuous section

over any neighbourhood U of the point (b, e) ∈ Γ−→ S1 . To show this, one notes that

the preimage χ −1(b, e) has two connected components, one of which consists of

the d-paths lying in I+ and the other of the d-paths lying in I−. Any open set U ⊂

Γ−→
S1

containing

ΓI− , arbitrarily

(b, e) must contain a pair (x+, y+) ∈ ΓI+ and a pair close to (b, e). Moreover, we may ﬁnd two sequences

(x−, y−) (xn±, yn±)

∈ ∈

ΓI± of points converging to (b, e) and the limits of any section over U along these

sequences would land in different connected component of χ −1(b, e). Hence, we

obtain −T→C(−→ S1 ) ≥ 2. On the other hand, we may represent Γ−→ S1 as the union

Γ−→
S1

=

F1

∪

F2

where F1 = ΓI+ and F2 = ΓI− −{(b, e), (b, b), (e, e)} and using the previous example we see that over each of the sets F1, F2 there exists a continuous section of χ . Hence
we obtain

−T→C(−→ S1 ) = 2.

4 Regular d-spaces

Deﬁnition 4 A d-space (X , d X ) will be called regular if one can ﬁnd a partition ΓX = F1 ∪ F2 ∪ · · · ∪ Fn, n = −T→C(X )

into ENRs such that the map χ admits a continuous section over each Fi and, addi-

tionally, the sets

r i =1

Fi

are

closed

for

any

r

=

1, .

. . , n.

Note the following property of the sets which appear in Deﬁnition 4:

Fi ∩ Fi = ∅ for i < i .

(6)

In the “undirected” theory of TC(X ) this property is automatically satisﬁed, see Proposition 4.12 of Farber (2008).
All examples of d-spaces which appear in this paper are regular. At present we know of no examples of d-spaces which are not regular; we plan to address this question in more detail elsewhere.
−→ Example 3 The directed circle S1 is regular as follows from the construction of Example 2.
The Cartesian product of d-spaces (X , d X ) and (Y , dY ) has a natural d-space structure. Any path γ : [0, 1] → X × Y has the form γ (t) = (γX (t), γY (t)) and we declare γ to be directed if both its coordinates are directed, i.e. γX ∈ d X and γY ∈ dY . Note that ΓX×Y = ΓX × ΓY .
Proposition 1 If the d-spaces (Xi , d Xi ) are regular, where i = 1, 2, . . . , k, then

−T→C(X1 × X2 × · · · × Xk) − 1 ≤ k −T→C(Xi ) − 1 .

Corollary 1

−→ The directed torus (S1 )n

satisﬁes −T→C((−→ S1 )n) ≤

n + 1.

Proof This follows from Proposition 1 and Example 2.

Deﬁnition 5 We say that a d-space X is strongly connected if ΓX = X × X .

In other words, in a strongly connected d-space X for any pair (x, y) in X × X there exists a directed path γ ∈ d X with γ (0) = x, γ (1) = y.
Proposition 2 For any strongly connected d-space X one has TC(X ) ≤ −T→C(X ).

Proof Let X be strongly connected and partition into the ENRs as in Deﬁnition

let ΓX 3 with

can serve for the path space ﬁbration X I → X × X which implies our result.

Example 4 Consider the directed loop O1 which can be deﬁned as the unit circle

S1 = {z ∈ C; |z| = 1} ⊂ C

with the d-structure described below. Any continuous path γ : [0, 1] → S1 can be

presented in the form γ (t) = exp(iφ(t)) where the function φ : [0, 1] → R is deﬁned

uniquely up to adding an integer multiple of ± 2π . We declare a path γ to be positive

if the function φ(t) strongly connected.

is nondecreasing. It is obvious that the Hence, using Proposition 2, we obtain

−Td→-Csp(Oac1e)

thus obtained ≥ TC(S1) =

is 2,

. On the other hand, we can partition O1 × O1 = F1 ∪ F2 where F1 = {(z1, z2) ∈ O1 × O1; z1 = z2} and F2 = {(z1, z2) ∈ O1 × O1; z1 = z2}. It is clear that we obtain

a section of χ over F1 by assigning the constant path at z for any pair (z, z) ∈ F1.

A continuous section of χ over F2 can be deﬁned as follows by moving z1 along the

circle in the positive direction towards z2 with constant velocity. We conclude that

−T→C(O1) = 2.

(9)

In addition, we see that the directed loop O1 is regular.

5 Directed graphs

Let G be a directed connected graph, i.e. each edge of G has a speciﬁed orientation. One naturally deﬁnes a d-structure on G as follows. Each edge of G can be identiﬁed either with the directed interval I (see Example 1) or with the loop O1 (see Example 4); these are “small directed paths”, i.e. the paths lying on a single edge. In general, the directed paths of G are concatenations of small directed paths.
For a directed graph G the set ΓG has the following property: if a pair (x, y) belongs to ΓG where x is an internal point of an edge e and y ∈/ e then all pairs (x , y) also belong to ΓG where x ∈ Int(e).
Proposition 3 −T→C(G) ≤ 3.
Proof Consider the following partition ΓG = F1 ∪ F2 ∪ F3 where
– F1 is the set of pairs of vertices (αi , α j ) of G which are in ΓG ; – F2 is the set of pairs (x, y) ∈ ΓG where either x or y is a vertex and the other point
lies in the interior of an arc; – F3 is the set of pairs (x, y) ∈ ΓG where x and y lie in the interiors of arcs.
For each pair of vertices (αi , α j ) ∈ ΓG ﬁx a directed path γi j from αi to α j . This deﬁnes a section of χ over F1. Note that all pairs (αi , αi ) belong to ΓG and the path γii can be chosen to be constant.
Consider now an oriented edge e and a vertex α j such that (x, α j ) ∈ ΓG for an internal point x ∈ Int(e). Let αi be the end point of e and let γx,αi denote the constant velocity path along e from x to αi . A continuous section of χ over Int(e) × α j can be deﬁned as (x, α j ) → γx,αi γi j where ∗ stands for concatenation. A continuous section over α j × Int(e) can be deﬁned similarly, and hence we have a continuous section of χ over F2.
Finally we describe a continuous section of χ over F3. Consider two oriented edges e and e where we shall ﬁrst assume that e = e . Let α denote the end point of e and β denote the initial point of e . We deﬁne a section of χ by

(x, y) → γx,α ∗ γαβ ∗ γβ y

123

20

E. Goubault et al.

for x ∈ Int(e) and y ∈ Int(e ). Here γxα denotes a constant velocity directed path along e connecting x to α; the path γβ y is deﬁned similarly and γαβ is a positive path from α to β.
Finally we consider the case when e = e . For a pair (x, y) ∈ ΓG with x, y ∈ Int(e) we deﬁne the section by (x, y) → γxy where γxy is a constant velocity path along e from x to y.
All the partial sections described above over various parts of F3 obviously combine into a continuous section over F3.
The following example shows that the directed topological complexity can be smaller than the usual complexity.
Example 5 Consider the following graph :

A patchwork for ΓG : F1 = {(b, e)} and F2 = ΓG \F1. We thus have −T→C(G) = 2 (here again, it is easy to see that there is no global section). But TC(G) = 3.
However in the special case of strongly connected graphs, the directed and classical topological complexity coincide:
Proposition 4 Let G be a strongly connected directed graph. Then
−T→C(G) = TC(G) = min(b1(G), 2) + 1.

Here b1(G) denotes the ﬁrst Betti number of the graph G.

6 Higher-dimensional directed spaces
We begin by recalling the deﬁnition of “geometric” precubical sets Fajstrup (2005). The interest Fajstrup et al. (2016) of such precubical sets is that the precubical semantics of most programs is a geometric precubical set. Also they are sufﬁciently tractable
123

Directed topological complexity

21

for us to compute, in some cases, their directed topological complexity, or more precisely, the directed topological complexity of their directed geometric realization, that we call, cubical complexes (see Deﬁnition 7).
Deﬁnition 6 A precubical set C is geometric when it satisﬁes the following conditions:
1. no self-intersection: two distinct iterated faces of a cube in C are distinct 2. maximal common faces: two cubes admitting a common face admit a maximal
common face.
Deﬁnition 7 A cubical complex K is a topological space of the form

K=

I nλ /≈

λ∈

where is a set, (nλ)λ∈ is a family of integers, and ≈ is an equivalence relation, such that, writing pλ : I nλ → K for the restriction of the quotient map λ∈ I nλ → K , we have
1. for every λ ∈ , the map pλ is injective, 2. given λ, μ ∈ , if pλ(I nλ ) ∩ pμ(I nμ ) = ∅ then there is an isometry hλ,μ from
a face Jλ of I nλ to a face Jμ of I nμ such that pλ(x) = pμ(y) if and only if y = hλ,μ(x).

As shown in Goubault and Mimram (2019) : Proposition 5 The realization of a geometric precubical set is a cubical complex.

Generalising Proposition 3, and as in the case of complexes in classical topology Farber (2008), one may show that

−T→C(X ) ≤ 2 dim(X ) + 1

for nice cubical complexes X . We shall address this claim elsewhere. The directed spheres Let n be the cartesian product of n copies of the unit segment with the d-structure generated by the standard ordering on [0, 1]. Its d-space structure is generated by a partially-ordered space Fajstrup et al. (2016).
Deﬁnition 8 The directed sphere −→ Sn of dimension n is deﬁned as the boundary ∂ n+1 of the hypercube n+1. Its d-structure is inherited from the one of n+1.
Proposition 6 −T→C(−→ Sn ) = 2 for any n ≥ 1.
The case n = 1 is covered by Example 2; see Borat and Grant (2019) for the general case.
We ﬁnish this section by the following two examples.

Example 6 Consider the 2-disc X = D2 = {z ∈ C; |z| ≤ 1} with the following directed structure: any directed path γ : [0, 1] → D2 starting at an internal point of the disc, i.e. with |γ (0)| < 1, is constant. The directed paths γ : [0, 1] → D2 with |γ (0)| = 1 are of two types: either γ (t) = eiα(t) or γ (t) = e−iα(t) where
α : [0, 1] → [0, π ] is a nondecreasing continuous function. In this example the interior
of the disc is in some sense disconnected from the boundary circle, more precisely
one cannot reach the interior from the boundary moving along d−→irected paths. The boundary circle as a d-space is isomorphic to the directed circle S1 , as described in Example 2. Using the result of that Example, we obtain that −T→C(D2) = 2. Since the disc D2 is contractible we know that TC(D2) = 1.

properties: (1) if γ (0) = 1 then γ is constant; (2) If γ (0) = 1 then the quantity

|γ (t) + 1| is non-increasing. In other words, we require that the distance from γ (t) to the point −1 ∈ S1 ⊂ C is non-increasing. It is easy to see that −T→C(X ) = 1 in this

example, while obviously TC(X ) = 2.

7 Directed homotopy equivalence and topological complexity
As of now, there is no uniquely well-established notion of directed homotopy equivalence between directed spaces, although there has been numeral proposals, among which one linked to our present problem Goubault (2017).
We take the view here that directed homotopy equivalences should at least induce equivalent trace categories, viewed with enough structure. We will show in the following sections that directed topological complexity is an invariant of basic equivalences that should be implied by any “reasonable” directed equivalences.
7.1 A basic dihomotopy equivalence, and dicontractibility
In Goubault (2017), the author introduced a notion of dihomotopy equivalence. The most important ingredients are that two equivalent d-spaces should be homotopy equivalent in some naive way, and their trace spaces should be homotopy equivalent as well.1 First, we need to deﬁne what we call continuous gradings. The idea is these graded dmaps are such that they map path spaces between pair of points that vary continuously with respect to the (target) pair of points : Deﬁnition 9 Let q : U → V be a d-map between two d-spaces U and V , v, v ∈ V , and let W ⊆ U × U denote W = (q × q)−1(v, v ). Suppose we have continuous maps
hv,v : d V (v, v ) × W → dU
1 In Goubault (2017), an extra “bisimulation relation” was added to the deﬁnition. This is not necessary for the main aims of this section, Proposition 7 and Theorem 1.

such that for all (u, u ) ∈ W , hv,v ( p, u, u ) ∈ dU (u, u ). In this case, we say that h = (hv,v ) is continuously graded, and by abuse of
notation, we write this graded map as a h : d V dU given by gradings hu,u : d V (q(u), q(u )) → dU (u, u ), varying continuously for (u, u ) ∈ W in dU dV (v,v ),
with the compact-open topology.

Any reasonable dihomotopy equivalence should be in particular a d-map inducing a (classical) homotopy equivalence since we want that being dihomotopy equivalent implies being homotopy equivalent. It should also induce (classical) homotopy equivalences on the corresponding path spaces. We call this minimum requirement, a basic dihomotopy equivalence :

Deﬁnition 10 Let X and Y be two d-spaces. A basic dihomotopy equivalence between X and Y is a d-map f : X → Y such that :

– f is a d-homotopy equivalence between X and Y , i.e. a d-map which is a dihomo-

topy equivalence in the sense of Grandis (2009) with homotopy inverse a d-map

g : Y → X.

– There exists a map F : dY

d X , continuously graded by Fx,x :

dY ( f (x), f (x )) → d X (x, x ) for (x, x ) ∈ ΓX , such that (d fx,x , Fx,x ) is a

homotopy equivalence between d X (x, x ) and dY ( f (x), f (x ))

– There exists a map G : d X

dY , continuously graded by G y,y :

d X (g(y), g(y )) → dY (y, y ) for (y, y ) ∈ ΓY such that (dgy,y , G y,y ) is a

homotopy equivalence between dY (y, y ) and d X (g(y), g(y )).

We sometimes write ( f , g, F, G) for the full data associated to the basic dihomotopy equivalence f : X → Y .

Remark This deﬁnition clearly bears a lot of similarities with Dwyer-Kan weak equivalences in simplicial categories (see e.g. Bergner 2004). The main ingredient of Dwyer-Kan weak equivalences being exactly that d f induces a homotopy equivalence. But our deﬁnition adds continuity and directedness requirements which are instrumental to our theorems and to the classiﬁcation of the underlying directed geometry.

Remark As noted by one of the referees, another way to view this is akin to a ﬁber homotopy equivalence : the conditions for dY ( f (x), f (x )) → d X (x, x ) and d X (g(y), g(y )) → dY (y, y ) to be homotopy equivalences mean that d f and dg are ﬁbre homotopy equivalences, for ﬁbers given by χX and χY ; but the usual theory does not apply because χX and χY are not ﬁbrations in general. Still, a notion of basic dihomotopy equivalence closer to ﬁbre homotopy equivalence, where we ask for f to be a homotopy equivalence between ΓX and ΓY , will be investigated elsewhere.
Example 8 – Let X , Y be two directed spaces. Suppose X and Y are isomorphic as d-spaces i.e. that there exists f : X → Y a d-map, which has an inverse, also a d-map. Then X and Y are basic dihomotopy equivalent. The proof goes as follows. Take f = u, g = u−1, dg = F the pointwise application of u−1 on paths in Y and d f = G the pointwise application of u on paths in X . This data obviously forms a directed homotopy equivalence.

– Consider Dubut et al. (2015) the directed space (“Fahrenberg’s matchbox”)

depicted on the left of Fig. 1, composed of the 5 upper faces of a directed cube [0, 1]3, with the d-space structure induced by the componentwise partial order.

Figure 2 also depicts a dihomotopy equivalence (in the sense of Grandis (2009)),

between M and to its upper face (so to a point). More precisely, the d-map f ,

which maps any point of M to the point of T just above of it, is a dihomotopy

equivalence, whose inverse modulo dihomotopy is the embedding g of T into M.

Hence, f ◦ g = idT and a dihomotopy from idM to g ◦ f is depicted in Fig. 2. But this homotopy equivalence, ( f , g), does not induce a basic dihomotopy equiv-

alence in our sense. As a matter of fact, consider points 0 and α : d X (0, α) is

homotopy equivalent to two points whereas d X ( f (0), f (α)) is homotopy equiv-

alent to a point.

As expected, directed topological complexity is an invariant of basic dihomotopy equivalence :

Proof As X and Y are basic dihomotopy equivalent, we have f : X → Y and

also get G a continuously graded map from d X to dY , which can be restricted to

G y,y : d X (g(y), g(y )) → dY (y, y ), inverse modulo homotopy to dgy,y ; and F a continuously graded map from dY to d X such that its restriction to d X (x, x ), for

conclude that −T→C(X ) = −T→C(Y ) and directed topological complexity is an invariant of basic dihomotopy equivalence.

A very simple application is that some spaces must have directed topological complexity of 1 :
Deﬁnition 11 A d-space X is dicontractible if it is basic dihomotopy equivalent to a point.
By applying Proposition 7, as the directed topological complexity of a point is 1, all dicontractible spaces have complexity 1, as in the undirected case. Similarly to the undirected case again, the converse is also true.
Theorem 1 Suppose X is a contractible d-space. Then, the dipath space map has a continuous section if and only if X is dicontractible.
Proof As X is contractible, we have f : X → {a0} (the constant map) and g : {a0} → X (the inclusion) which form a (classical) homotopy equivalence. Trivially, f and g are d-maps, and form a d-homotopy equivalence.
Suppose that we have a continuous section s of χ . There is an obvious inclusion map i : {s(a, b)} → d X (a, b), which is graded in a and b. Deﬁne R to be this map. Now the constant map r : d X (a, b) → {s(a, b)} is a retraction map for i.
We deﬁne

H : d X × [0, 1] → (u, t) → v s.t.

dX

v(x) = u(x)

v(x) = s (u(t), b)

if 0 ≤ x ≤ t if t ≥ x ≤ 1

(H (u, t)(x) is extended by continuity at t = 1, when x = 1, as being equal to s(b, b)(1) = b).2
As concatenation and evaluation are continuous and as s is continuous in both arguments H is continuous in u ∈ d X and in t. H induces families Ha,b : d X (a, b) × [0, 1] → d X (a, b), and because H is continuous in u in the compact-open topology, this family Ha,b is continuous in a and b in X .
Finally, we note that H (u, 1) = u and H (u, 0) = s(u(0), b) = i ◦ r (u). Hence r is a deformation retraction and d X (a, b) is homotopy equivalent to {s(a, b)} and has the homotopy type we expect (is contractible for all a and b), meaning that R is a (graded) homotopy equivalence.
Conversely, suppose X is dicontractible. We have in particular a continuous map R : {∗} → d X , which is graded in (a, b) ∈ ΓX . Deﬁne s(a, b) = Ra,b(∗), this is a continuous section of χ .
Remark Sometimes, we do not know right away, in the theorem above, that X is contractible. But instead, there is an initial state in X , i.e. a state a0 from which every

2 Note that we do not need to ask for s(b, b) to be the constant path on b. The section on the diagonal of ΓX is in fact necessarily made of paths homotopic to b. We thank an anonymous referee and Jeremy Dubut for pointing out this fact to us.

point of X is reachable. Suppose then that, as in the Theorem above, χ has a continuous section s : ΓX → d X . Consider s (a, b) = s−1(a0, a) ∗ s(a0, b) the concatenation of the inverse dipath, going from a to a0, with the dipath going from a0 to b : this is a continuous path from a to b for all a, b in X . Now, s is obviously continuous since
concatenation, and s, are. By a classical theorem Farber (2008), this implies that X is
contractible and the rest of the theorem holds.

Example 9 Direct applications of Proposition 7 show that :
– Directed n-tori O1n and O1m cannot be basic dihomotopy equivalent when n = m. – Directed n-tori O1n cannot be basic dihomotopy equivalent to any directed graph
for n ≥ 3.

We end this section by sketching a ﬁrst connection between directed topological complexity and some invariants (see e.g. Dubut et al. 2015) that have been introducted in directed topology, like natural homology, Dubut et al. (2016). We refer the reader to Dubut et al. (2016) for the precise deﬁnitions of natural homology and of bisimulation (in that context) :

−→ Example 10 We get back to example S1 .
Its ﬁrst homology functor was calculated in Dubut et al. (−→2015), and is not a constant functor (it contains Z2 and Z in its image). Therefore S1 cannot have directed topological complexity of 1. It is also easy to see that the ﬁrst natural homology functor of O1 is ZN between two equal points and hence cannot have directed topological complexity of 1.
