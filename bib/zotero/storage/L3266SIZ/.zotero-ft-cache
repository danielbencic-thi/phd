Abstract—Navigation is one of the pivotal and defining features of an autonomous robot. Essentially, the autonomous robot navigation problem can be divided into four parts namely: perception, localisation, cognition and path planning, out of which path planning is important and has been a constant research topic. In this paper, a brief introduction and review of some of the path planning approaches (both classical and heuristic) is provided. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods are discussed.
Keywords—Autonomous robot navigation, path planning, classical and heuristic approaches,
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the key features desirable in the autonomous robots is the ability to navigate through the environment. Most of the robot applied fields these days like mining, agriculture etc. require the robots to move and perform tasks in a variety of environments which are sometimes even unpredictable. The navigation problem consists of four integral parts namely perception, localization, motion control and path planning. The path planning is the determination of a collision-free path in a given environment which is often a cluttered environment in a real world situation(1). A lot of different path planning approaches have been proposed and tested in various environments with static and dynamic obstacles. These include both classical approaches like potential fields, cell decomposition, bug algorithm, roadmap etc. and heuristic approaches like neural networks, fuzzy logic, wavelets etc. (2). Both of these approaches have various advantages anddisadvantages in various cases. The two categories namely global and local path planner make use of all of these approaches to find an optimal path for the robot in a given environment. The former generates low resolution high level plan of the environment while the latter generates a high resolution plan of a part of the global path (3, 4). Hybrid planners integrating these two into a single planner have been proposed in (5,6). In the following section some of the prominent heuristic path planning approaches have been

reviewed in II followed by some classical path planning approaches in III.
II. HEURISTIC APPROACHES
The Heuristic path planning approaches, though have come into use recently as compared to the Classical approaches, have gained a lot of importance due to their human like behaviour-based learning. Some of the popular approaches of this class such as Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Fuzzy Logic, Wavelets, Genetic Algorithm are discussed here
A. Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs)
An ANN is a bio-inspired artificial model of a human brain with the ability to mimic the behaviour based learning. The basic computational unit of an ANN is called a neuron which has the ability to store and reproduce experiential information similar to the human brain. These have been widely used in many search optimization, learning and pattern recognition problems due to their ability to produce simple and optimal solutions in complex situationsMaintaining the Integrity of the Specifications
In (7), the authors study in Self Supervised Learning (SSL), how the arrangement of robot’s learning behaviour should be in order that it performs the assigned task even in case the original sensor que becomes unavailable. A hybrid method using a combination of ANN and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed in (8). In this, the PSO is used to provide a smooth trajectory for NN to reach the goal. An ANN based path planner with the ability to plan paths for multiple robots simultaneously while avoiding obstacles in dynamic environments is proposed in (9). A complete coverage path planning which is necessary in cleaning robots is proposed in (10) using ANN. However there are certain disadvantages to using ANNs. The training data required may be quite large in some cases to ensure that the results are statistically correct (11). Also the minimisation of error between the computed and required output in case of supervised learning ANNs is difficult.

B. Fuzzy Logic
The concept of fuzzy sets was first proposed by Zadeh [12] in 1965. This approach has wide application in the robot path planning as it provides a formal technique for representing and implementing the human experts’ heuristic knowledge and perception-based actions. The methodology of a Fuzzy Logic controller(FLC) is very useful in dealing with the real world uncertainties without the requirement of an absolute model of the environment [13]. A path planner based on fuzzy logic and filter smoothing in a dynamic environment is implemented on an autonomous mobile robot in [14]. An FLC for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) in a 2-D space is developed in [15]. A hybrid algorithm using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm was for path planning of a mobile robot in [16]. The GA was used to modify the input and output membership functions for the FLC. A path planning approach for humanoid robots based on Fuzzy Markov Decision Process(FMDP) is proposed in [17]. The proposed method is focused on the issue of unavailability of thorough sensory information of the environment.
C. Wavelets
The wavelet transform is a mathematical tool that decomposes a signal into a representation that shows signal details and trends as a function of time. This approach has been implemented successfully to solve the path planning problem. A hierarchical on-line path planning approach is proposed in [18]. The method uses a multiresolution of the environment at different distances from the robot which is obtained by wavelets. However, this method has a drawback of global replanning at each step. This has been resolved in [19] in which a global plan is created and local re-planning is done at each step. A hierarchicalmotion planning is proposed in [20] keeping in view the compatibility between the high-level logic task and the low-level vehicle dynamics. The proposed planner is based on a special interaction between these two levels of planning. A motion planner based on cell decomposition is proposed in [21] which enables the use of wavelet transforms in both perception and motion planning simultaneously thus reducing computing cost. The multi resolution cell decomposition can be achieved through quad-trees as well. However, this has the disadvantage that the cells around all the obstacles in the environment map have high resolution irrespective of the distance of the obstacle from the robot. This adds to the computational cost.
D. Genetic Algorithm(GA)
GA is an optimization tool that is most commonly used to generate high quality solutions for combination optimization problems and search problems. The GA is inspired from the process of natural selection and relies on evolutionary operators like mutation, crossover and selection. The GA starts with no knowledge of correct solution and entirely depends on the responses of the environment and the above mentioned evolutionary operators and arrive at the best solution [22].
A knowledge-based genetic algorithm for path planning is proposed in [23]. In this, the operators are applied based on

heuristic knowledge to the parents from the initial generation In [24], a GA based path planning algorithm is proposed in which chromosome has a variable length. A global path planner based on GA is proposed in [25]. In the proposed method, the length of the binary strings is shortened by projecting the twodimensional coordinates of points in the workspace into one dimensional ones. In [26], implementation of GA is given. The algorithm is adjusted to the resource constraints of the microcontroller used in embedded environments. Figure 1. shows the process flowchart of a basic genetic algorithm. Theuse of genetic operations like crossover, mutation and selection depends on the particular problem.

III. CLASSICAL APPROACHES The classical methods have been in use majorly before 2000s though heuristic approaches sprung into domination later [27]. The classical path planners either find a solution or prove that such solution does not exist. Their usage in real world is limited due to their computational intensiveness and inability to cope with uncertainties [28]. Following classical methods

are discussed here: Cell Decomposition (CD), Potential Fields (PF), Roadmap.
A. Potential Fields The concept of using Artificial Potential Fields(APF) in autonomous robots for obstacle avoidance was first proposed by Khatib.O [29]. The main idea of this method is to guide the robot to the target by generation of attractive and repulsive forces within the robot’s working environment. The attractive forces are assigned to the targets and repulsive forces are assigned to the obstacles.
A path planning method for an Autonomous Surface Vessel based on APF is provided in [30]. Inthis, the APF method is used as a local path planning algorithm for maintaining the vessel in the centre of the river simultaneously avoiding the obstacles. A hybrid approach using APF in combination with PSO is proposed in [31] where PSO is used to reduce local minima of APF. An APF based regression search method is proposed in [32]. Here, virtual local targets are used to escape oscillations and then the path produced by this modified APF method is optimised by regression search.The main disadvantage of this method is the occurrence of trap local minima [33, 34] in which case the robot keeps oscillating between the obstacles. Various techniques are available to overcome this like Simulated Annealing[27], PSO [31]. Figure 2. shows the variation of the attractive potential field with the distance of the robot. The attractive potential is given as
(1)
Here, ζ is a proportionality constant and is the coefficient of attractive field potentials. The term d(q, qgoal)is the eucledian distance between the position of the robot, q and the position of the goal qgoal..
Fig.2:Variation of attractive potential field with the distance of the robot from goal.
As can be seen from the plot of Figure(2), the attractive potential is a paraboloid. But this causes the attractive force obtained by gradient of the potential to be out of bound. This can be overcome by using a conic well in combination with this parabolic well.

(2)
Here is the threshold distance. If the robot-goal distance is greater than this, the conic well potential is taken for force calculation.
B. Roadmap
In this approach, the roadmaps are built with a set of paths where each path consists of collision free area connections. These roadmaps are later used for path planning. The path planning is thus reduced to searching for a series of roads from initial position to the goal from a road network connecting the initial and goal points [35]. A safe clearance path planning method using Voronoi diagram is proposed in [36] with an attempt to solve the optimality issue. A two phase path planning method for high dimensional configuration space based on PRM is proposed in [37]. The two phases are namely learning phase and query phase. The proposed method is for robots in static workspace. The method is claimed to be highly time efficient. A method for solving single-query path planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces by incrementally building two rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) is proposed in [38]. The trees explore the space around them and also advance towards each other by a simple greedy heuristic. However, the PRM method is not complete in the sense that it may not find a path even though one exists as it is probabilistic.
C. Cell Decomposition
Cell Decomposition(CD) is highly used by literature in path planning problems. Cell Decomposition is the representation of search space in the form of individual units called cells. The goal is to provide a sequence of obstacle free steps from the starting point through the goal. Such a sequence of steps would be provided by using cells without obstacles. The cells with obstacles are first divided into two new cells and then the pure cells(cells without obstacles) are added to the sequence [28]. In [39], a novel approximate cell decomposition strategy is developed in which the obstacles, targets, sensor’s platform and field of vision(FOV) are represented as closed and bounded subsets of a Euclidean workspace. In [40], a hierarchical approximate cell decomposition strategy is proposed. The methodology was to include time as one of the dimensions of the model world which allows the dynamic obstacles to be regarded as stationary in an extended world. Hierarchical approximate cell decomposition method is also used in [41]. A path planning technique using harmonic functions and probabilistic cell decomposition is given in [42]. However, CD method is not usable in 8-directional planning [43] and also involves more tedious mathematical operations.
IV. CONCLUSION
The classical approaches, though have been widely used in the early years of research, have been largely replaced by the heuristic approaches in the recent times. This is due to the fact that the heuristic approaches are close to the human way of behavior learning. However, inspite of the drawbacks of the

classical, they can be used for effective path planning by combining them with the heuristic approaches to minimize their errors. These kind of hybrid algorithms are developed even with multiple heuristic algorithms for more efficiency and optimality.
