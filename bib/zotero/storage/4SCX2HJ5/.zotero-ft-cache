Chapter 1
Introduction
You sitting in an airplane at night, watching a movie displayed on the screen attached to the seat in front of you. The airplane gently banks to the left. You may feel the slight acceleration, but you won’t see any change in the position of the movie screen. Both you and the screen are in the same frame of reference, so unless you stand up or make another move, the position and orientation of the screen relative to your position and orientation won’t change. The same is not true with respect to your position and orientation relative to the frame of reference of the earth. The airplane is moving forward at a very high speed and the bank changes your orientation with respect to the earth. The transformation of coordinates (position and orientation) from one frame of reference is a fundamental operation in several areas: ﬂight control of aircraft and rockets, movement of manipulators in robotics, and computer graphics. This tutorial introduces the mathematics of rotations using two formalisms: (1) Euler angles are the angles of rotation of a three-dimensional coordinate frame. A rotation of Euler angles is represented as a matrix of trigonometric functions of the angles. (2) Quaternions are an algebraic structure that extends the familiar concept of complex numbers. While quaternions are much less intuitive than angles, rotations deﬁned by quaternions can be computed more efﬁciently and with more stability, and therefore are widely used. The tutorial assumes an elementary knowledge of trigonometry and matrices. The computations will be given in great detail for two reasons. First, so that you can be convinced of the correctness of the formulas, and, second, so that you can learn how to do them yourselves, in case you come across a context that uses different deﬁnitions or notation. For a comprehensive presentation of quaternions using vector algebra, see: John Vince. Quaternions for Computer Graphics, 2011, Springer.

Chapter 2

Rotations in two dimensions

We start by discussing rotations in two dimensions; the concepts and formulas should be familiar and a review will facilitate learning about rotations in three dimensions.

2.1 Cartesian and polar coordinates

A vector or a position (the tip of the vector) in a two-dimensional space can be given either in cartesian coordinates (x, y) or in polar coordinates (r, φ), relative to a frame of reference:

x

r

y

φ

The formulas for transforming one representation to another are:

x = r cos φ y = r sin φ

r = x2 + y2

φ

=

tan−1

y x

.

2.2 Rotating a vector
Suppose now that the vector is rotated by the angle θ:

x

r

y x

r

y

θ

φ

2

The new vector’s polar coordinates are (r, φ + θ) and its cartesian coordinates can be computed using the trigonometric identities for the sum of two angles:
x = r cos(φ + θ) = r(cos φ cos θ − sin φ sin θ) = (r cos φ) cos θ − (r sin φ) sin θ = x cos θ − y sin θ,

y = r sin(φ + θ) = r(sin φ cos θ + cos φ sin θ) = (r sin φ) cos θ + (r cos φ) sin θ = y cos θ + x sin θ = x sin θ + y cos θ .

The transformation of the position (x, y) to (x , y ) caused by a rotation through the angle θ can be expressed in matrix notation as:

x y

=

cos θ − sin θ sin θ cos θ

x y

.

Example
Let r = 1 and let both θ and φ be 30◦ so that: x = r cos φ = cos φ = cos θ = cos 30◦ = √3/2 y = r sin φ = sin φ = sin θ = sin 30◦ = 1/2 .

We can now compute the values of x and y :

x y

=

√3/2 1/2

−√13//22

√3/2 1/2

=

1(√/23/· √2)32/−2

(1/2)2 + 1/2 ·

√3/2

=

1√/32/2

.

The result makes sense since φ + θ = 60◦.

2.3 A geometric derivation of the rotation matrix
The rotation matrix can be derived geometrically. Rather than look at the vector, let us look at its x and y components and rotate them (counterclockwise) by θ (Figure 2.1). The x- and y- components are rotated by the angle θ so that the OAB becomes OA B . Construct two right triangles: (1) Drop the perpendicular from A to the x-axis to form the right triangle OA C; (b) Construct a line through A parallel to the x-axis and a line through B parallel to the y-axis. They intersect at C to form the right triangle B A C . Since A C is parallel to CO, C A O = A OC = θ. OA B is a right angle and A B C is a right triangle so A B C = θ. The sides of the two right triangles are labeled with

their lengths obtained by trigonometry. It is now easy to see that x is the length of OC minus the length of A C and that y is the length of CA plus the length of C B :
x = x cos θ − y sin θ y = x sin θ + y cos θ.

2.4 Rotating the frame of reference

The effect of rotating a vector by θ is the same as the effect obtained by rotation of the frame of reference. The left diagram below shows a vector in the frame of reference A. The right diagram shows the same vector after frame A is rotated θ relative to a new frame B.

what are its coordinates (xB, yB) in the frame B? The geometry of this diagram is the same as the geometry of the diagram in Section 2.2, so we can use the same equation:

xB yB

=

cos θ − sin θ sin θ cos θ

xA yA

.

2.5 Multiple rotations

If we know (xB, yB), we can multiply it by the rotation matrix for ψ to obtain (xC, yC). Let us denote the rotation matrix from frame A to frame B by RBA and the rotation matrix from frame B to frame C by RCB. Given pA, the coordinates of a point in frame A, its coordinates in frame B are pB = RBA pA, and pC, its coordinates in frame C, are pC = RCB pB. Combining the two equations we have:

pC = RCB pB = RCB RBA pA . Let RCA = RCB RBA. This is the rotation matrix from A to C, so we can obtain the coordinates pC directly from pA by:
pC = RCA pA .

Example

Let ψ = 30◦ so RCB = RBA. Then:

xC yC

=

√3/2 −1/2 1/2 √3/2

1/2 √3/2

=

0 1

.

From the drawing we see the vector lies on the yC-axis which corresponds to the coordinates (0, 1).

Let us now compute:

RCA = RCB RBA =

√3/2 1/2

−√13//22

−√13//22

=

The computation pC = RCA pA is:

xC yC

=

1/2 −√3/2 √3/2 1/2

√3/2 1/2

=

0 1

,

the same result obtained in the two-stage computation.

Example

Consider the vector (1, 0) lying on the x-axis of frame A. Rotate A by 15◦ to frame B and

the coordinates of the vector in frame C an angle of 45◦ with the x-axis of frame

C.

The values of the trigonometric functions for 15◦ are:

√6−4 √2 = √188+√2 = √22 .

If we multiply the two rotation matrices:

√3 2 1

=

√2 √22

−√2√22

,

22

the result is the rotation matrix for a rotation by 45◦.

If we multiply the two matrices in the opposite order, we get the same result:

√6+√2 √6−4 √2

22

This shows that rotating by 15◦ and then by 30◦ gives the same result as rotating by 30◦ and then by 15◦. This is not surprising because we are familiar with the commutativity of turning knobs clockwise and counterclockwise. Unfortunately, we will not be so lucky when we discuss three-dimensional rotations.

Chapter 3
Rotations in three dimensions

The concept of coordinate transformations in three-dimensions is the same as in two dimensions, however, the mathematics are more complicated. Furthermore, many of us ﬁnd it difﬁcult to visualize explanations of three-dimensional motion when all we are shown is two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional objects.
The great eighteenth-century mathematician Leonhard Euler proved that an arbitrary three-dimensional rotation can be obtained by three individual rotations around the axes. In his honor, the angles of the rotations are called Euler angles.

3.1 Rotations around the three axes
A two-dimensional x-y coordinate frame can be considered to be part of the threedimensional coordinate frame by adding a z-axis perpendicular to the x- and y-axes. Here is a two-dimensional representation of the three-dimensional coordinate frame:
up in

left

right

out down

The x-axis is drawn left and right on the paper and the y-axis is drawn up and down on the paper. The diagonal line represents the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the other two axes and therefore its positive direction is out of the paper and its negative direction is into the paper.
The standard x-y-z coordinate frame has the positive directions of its axes pointing in the directions (right, up, out) as shown in the left diagram:

y

x

x

y

z

z

7

Rotate the coordinate frame counterclockwise around the z-axis, so the z-axis which remains unchanged (right diagram). The new orientation of the frame is (up, left, out). Consider now a rotation of 90◦ around the x-axis:
y

x

x

z

y

z

This causes the y-axis to “jump out” of the page and the z-axis to “fall down” onto the page, resulting in the orientation (right, out, down).
Finally, consider a rotation of 90◦ around the y-axis (left diagram):

y

y

x

x

z

z

The x-axis “drops below” the paper and the z-axis “falls right” onto the paper. The new position of the frame is (in, up, right).

3.2 The right hand rule
The z-axis must be perpendicular to the x- and y-axes, but there are two orientations for this line: one in which the positive direction of the axis is out of the paper and another where the positive direction of the axis is into the paper. It doesn’t matter which one we choose as long as the choice is consistent. The conventional choice is the right hand rule. Curl the ﬁngers of your right hand so that they go by the shortest path from the one axis to another axis. Your thumb now points in the positive direction of the third axis. For the familiar x- and y-axes on paper, curl your ﬁngers on the short 90◦ path from the x-axis to the y-axis (not on the long 270◦ path from the x-axis to the y-axis). When you do so your thumb points out of the paper and this is taken as the positive direction of the z-axis. The following diagram shows the right-hand coordinate system displayed with each of the three axes pointing out of the paper:

z

x

The three rotations are:
Rotate from x to y around z, Rotate from y to z around x, Rotate from z to x around y.

3.3 Matrices for three-dimensional rotations

A three-dimensional rotation matrix will be a 3 × 3 matrix because each point p in a frame has three coordinates px, py, pz that must be moved. Consider ﬁrst a rotation around the z-axis. The x and y coordinates are rotated as in two dimensions and the z coordinate remains unchanged. Therefore, the matrix is:

 cos θ − sin θ 0 

 

sin θ

cos θ

0

 

.





0

01

For a rotation about the x-axis, the x coordinate is unchanged and the y and z coordinates are transformed “as if” they were the x and y coordinates of a rotation around the z-axis:

1 0

0

 

For a rotation about the y-axis, the y coordinate is unchanged and the z and x coordinates are transformed “as if” they were the x and y coordinates of a rotation around the z-axis:

 cos θ 0 sin θ 

 

 

.

− sin θ 0 cos θ

It may seem strange that the signs of sin θ have changed. To convince yourself that this matrix is correct, redraw the diagram in Section 2.2 and perform the computations, substituting z for x and x for y.

3.4 Multiple rotations

Here is an example of three successive rotations of a coordiante frame: ﬁrst, 90◦ around the z-axis, then 90◦ around the y-axis and ﬁnally 90◦ around the x-axis:

y

x

z

y

x

x

x

y

y

z

z

z

This is called a zyx Euler angle rotation. The ﬁnal orientation is (in, up, right).
There is one caveat to composing rotations: three-dimensional rotations do not commute. Let us demonstrate this by a simple sequence of two rotations. Consider a rotation of 90◦ around the z-axis, followed by a rotation of 90◦ around the x-axis:

y

x

x

x

y

z

z

z

y

The result can be expressed as (up, out, right). Now consider the commuted operation: a rotation of 90◦ around the x-axis, followed by a rotation of 90◦ around the z-axis:
y

x

x

y

z

y

x

z

z

The result can be expressed as (out, left, down) which is not the same as the previous orientation.
There are three axes so there should be 33 = 27 sequences of Euler angles. However, there is no point in rotating around the same axis twice in succession because the same result can be obtained by rotating once by the sum of the angles, so there are only 3 · 2 · 2 = 12 different Euler angle sequences:

xyx xyz xzx xzy yxy yxz yzx yzy zxy zxz zyx zyz .

10

3.5 Euler angles for transforming a vector

Let us return to the sequence of Euler angle rotations at the beginning of Section 3.4. Consider the vector (or point) (1, 1, 1) in the ﬁnal frame:
y

x

(1, 1, 1)

z
What are its coordinates in the previous frame that was rotated around the x-axis to become this frame? Rotating the previous frame (not the vector), we ﬁnd that the point’s coordinates are (1, −1, 1):
z x (1, −1, 1)
y

What are its coordinates in the previous frame that was rotated around the y-axis to become this frame? Rotating the previous frame around the y-axis gives (1, −1, −1):
x (1, −1, −1)

y z

Finally, what are its coordinates in the previous frame that was rotated around the z-axis to become this frame? Rotating the previous frame around the z-axis gives the coordinates in the original frame (1, 1−, 1):
y
(1, 1, −1)

x z

These coordinates can be computed from the rotation matrices for the rotations around the three axes. First around the x-axis:

3.6 One matrix for three rotations

Instead of performing the three multiplications of a vector by a matrix, we can multiply the matrices for the three Euler angles together. The result is the matrix for the complete rotation:

3.7 The matrix for an arbitrary rotation

The previous section showed an example of a matrix that rotates a vector around the axes zyx by 90◦ each. The matrix for arbitrary rotations around these axes is obtained by multiplying the matrices for each axis using arbitrary angles: a rotation of ψ around the z-axis, a rotation of θ around the y axis and a rotation of φ around the x-axis. The resulting matrix is computed as follows. First multiply the rotation around the x-axis by the rotation around the y-axis:

 cos θ 0 sin θ  1 0

Chapter 4
Quaternions

4.1 Complex numbers

A complex number is a pair written formally as a + bi, where a, b are real numbers and i is
a new symbol. Arithmetic is performed as if complex numbers were formal polynomials with indeterminate i and then simpliﬁed using the identify i2 = −1:

(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i (a + bi) (c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi2
= (ac − bd) + (ad + bc)i.

Complex numbers can represent vectors and points in the plane. The number x + iy is identiﬁed with the vector from (0, 0) to the point (x, y). Complex multiplication can be used to rotate a vector. By Euler’s formula:
eiθ = (cos θ + i sin θ) ,

so: eiθ(x + iy) = (cos θ + i sin θ)(x + yi) = (x cos θ − y sin θ) + i(x sin θ + y cos θ) ,

which is the two-dimensional rotation of (x, y) by θ:

x y

=

cos θ − sin θ sin θ cos θ

x y

.

In 1843, the mathematician William R. Hamilton discovered that three-dimensional rotations can be described by a generalization of complex numbers called quaternions.

4.2 The algebra of quaternions
A quaternion is a 4-tuple written formally as q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k, where qi are real numbers and the symbols i, j, k satisfy the following identities:
i2 = j2 = k2 = −1 ij = k, ji = −k jk = i, kj = −i ki = j, ik = −j .
Multiplication of these symbols i, j, k are not commutative. To remember the sign of a multiplication, consider the symbols to be arranged cyclically:
14

i

k

j

If two symbols to be multiplied are adjacent clockwise, the sign is plus, whereas if they are adjacent counterclockwise, the sign is minus. Arithmetic is performed formally and the results are simpliﬁed using the identities. Here are the formulas for adding and multiplying two quaternions:
(q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k) + (p0 + p1i + p2j + p3k) = (q0 + p0) + (q1 + p1)i + (q2 + p2)j + (q3 + p3)k

(q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k) (p0 + p1i + p2j + p3k) = (q0 p0 + q1 p1i2 + q2 p2j2 + q3 p3k2) + (q0 p1i + q1 p0i + q2 p3jk + q3 p2kj) + (q0 p2j + q2 p0j + q1 p3ik + q3 p1ki) + (q0 p3k + q3 p0k + q1 p2ij + q2 p1ji) = (q0 p0 − q1 p1 − q2 p2 − q3 p3) + (q0 p1 + q1 p0 + q2 p3 − q3 p2)i + (q0 p2 + q2 p0 − q1 p3 + q3 p1)j + (q0 p3 + q3 p0 + q1 p2 − q2 p1)k.

4.3 The conjugate and absolute value of a complex number

Complex numbers form a ﬁeld, because multiplication is commutative and every nonzero complex number has an inverse:

(a + bi)(a − bi) = a2 − b2i2 = a2 + b2

(a + bi)(a − bi) a2 + b2

=

1

(a + bi)−1

=

a − bi a2 + b2

.

F√oar2

a complex number z = a + bi, deﬁne its + b2. Then its inverse can be written as:

conjugate

z∗

as

a

−

bi

and

its

norm

as

|z|

=

z−1

=

z∗ |z|2

.

4.4 The conjugate and norm of a quaternion
The corresponding deﬁnitions for quaternions are as follows. 15

Given q = q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k, its conjugate is:

q∗ = q0 − q1i − q2j − q3k ,

and its norm is:

|q| = q20 + q21 + q22 + q23 .

Every nonzero quaternion has an inverse:

q q∗ = (q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k)(q0 − q1i − q2j − q3k)

= (q0q0 − q1q1i2 − q2q2j2 − q3q3k2) +

(−q0q1 + q1q0 − q2q3 + q3q2)i +

(−q0q2 + q2q0 + q1q3 − q3q1)j +

(−q0q3 + q3q0 − q1q2 + q2q1)k

= q20 + q21 + q22 + q23 .

q−1

=

q∗ |q|2

.

Quaternions do not form a ﬁeld because multiplication is not commutative.

4.5 Quaternions for rotations
A vector in three-dimensional space can be expressed as a pure quaternion, a quaternion with no real part: q = 0 + xi + yj + zk. A rotation is expressed by a quaternion qR with the additional requirement that its norm |qR| be equal to 1. A rotation from one coordinate frame A to another B is given by the conjugation operation:
qB = qR qA q∗R.
This operation will result in a quaternion qB which is also a vector since it has no real part:
qR qA q∗R = (q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k)(xi + yj + zk)(q0 − q1i − q2j − q3k) = (x(q20 + q21 − q22 − q23) + 2y(q1q2 − q0q3) + 2z(q0q2 + q1q3))i + (2x(q0q3 + q1q2) + y(q20 − q21 + q22 − q23) + 2z(q2q3 − q0q1))j + (2x(q1q3 − q0q2) + 2y(q0q1 + q2q3) + z(q20 − q21 − q22 + q23))k.
The detailed multiplication is given in Appendix A. This computation does not require the computation of trigonometric functions, only the addition and multiplication of real numbers.

4.6 From a quaternion to a rotation matrix
We need to compute the quaternion of a rotation from Euler angles and rotation matrices and conversely from quaternions back to angles and matrices.

Expressing the formula for qR qA q∗R as a matrix gives:

q20 − q21 − q22 + q23

The matrix can be simpliﬁed since the norm of a rotation quaternion is 1:

|q| = q20 + q21 + q22 + q23 = 1, from which we have the following equations:

−q22 − q23 = q20 + q21 − 1 −q21 − q23 = q20 + q22 − 1 −q21 − q22 = q20 + q23 − 1.
After simpliﬁcation the matrix becomes:

4.7 From a matrix of angles to a quaternion

Given a rotation matrix M, we can compute the quaternion that represents the same rotation. First compute the trace, the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix:

Trace(M) = M11 + M22 + M33 = 2(3q20 + q21 + q22 + q23 − 1.5) = 2(3q20 + (1 − q20) − 1.5) = 2(2q20 − 0.5) = 4q20 − 1.
We can solve this equation for q0:

|q0| =

Trace(M) 4

+

1

.

Once we have q0, we can obtain q1 from M11:

M11 = 2(q20 + q21 − 0.5) = 2

4.8 From Euler angles to a quaternion

Given a rotation by an angle, the corresponding quaternion can be computed. Consider the rotation ψ around the z-axis:

 cos ψ − sin ψ 0 

Consider a rotation of +90◦ around the z-axis. It takes the point (1, 0, 0) to (0, 1, 0). The

Using the formulas in Section 4.7 and computing Trace(M) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, we have:

|q0| = |q1| = |q2| = |q3| =

The point (1, 0, 0) is 0 + i + 0j + 0k as a quaternion so we compute the rotation as:

Appendix A
Multiplication of three quaternions

We compute the multiplication of quarternions to change a coordinate frame:

qR qA q∗R = (q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k)(xi + yj + zk)(q0 − q1i − q2j − q3k) . Multiply the ﬁrst two factors:

(q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k)(xi + yj + zk) = q0xi + q0yj + q0zk + q1xi2 + q1yij + q1zik + q2xji + q2yj2 + q2zjk + q3xki + q3ykj + q3zk2 = −q1x − q2y − q3z + q0xi + q2zi − q3yi + q0yj − q1zj + q3xj + q0zk + q1yk − q2xk .
Now mulitply on the right by (q0 − q1i − q2j − q3k).
The real part Multiply the ﬁrst row by q0, the second by −q1i, the third by −q2j and the fourth by −q3k:

−q0q1x − q0q2y − q0q3z +q0q1x + q1q2z − q1q3y +q0q2y − q1q2z + q2q3x +q0q3z + q1q3y − q2q3x = 0 .

The coefﬁcient of i
Multiply the second row by q0 the ﬁrst by −q1i, the fourth by −q2j (since kj = −i) and the third by −q3k (since jk = i):

Collecting terms gives:

+q0q0x + q0q2z − q0q3y +q1q1x + q1q2y + q1q3z +q0q2z + q1q2y − q2q2x −q0q3y + q1q3z − q3q3x .
(q20 + q21 − q22 − q23)x+ 2(q1q2 − q0q3)y+ 2(q0q2 + q1q3)z .

20

The coefﬁcient of j
Multiply the third row by q0, the fourth by −q1i (since ki = j), the ﬁrst by −q2j and the second by −q3k (since ik = −j):

+q0q0y − q0q1z + q0q3x −q0q1z − q1q1y + q1q2x +q1q2x + q2q2y + q2q3x +q0q3x + q2q3z − q3q3y .

Collecting terms gives:

2(q1q2 + q0q3)x+ (q20 − q21 + q22 − q23)y+ 2(q2q3 − q0q1)z .

The coefﬁcient of k
Multiply the fourth row by q0, the third by −q1i (since ji = −k), the second by −q2j (since ij = k and the ﬁrst by −q3k:

+q0q0z + q0q1y − q0q2x +q0q1y − q1q1z + q1q3x −q0q2x − q2q2z + q2q3y +q1q3x + q2q3y + q3q3z .

Collecting terms gives:

2(q1q3 − q0q2)x+ 2(q2q3 + q0q1)y+ (q20 − q21 − q22 + q23)z .

Collect the results in one quaternion

(x(q20 + q21 − q22 − q23) + 2y(q1q2 − q0q3) + 2z(q0q2 + q1q3))i+ (2x(q0q3 + q1q2) + y(q20 − q21 + q22 − q23) + 2z(q2q3 − q0q1))j+ (2x(q1q3 − q0q2) + 2y(q0q1 + q2q3) + z(q20 − q21 − q22 + q23))k .
