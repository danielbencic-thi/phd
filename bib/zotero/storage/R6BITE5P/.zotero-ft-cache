VSCode inspired theme
moritz moritz
June 2021 in

Hi there,
I just want to share my VSCode inspired dark theme:

There are still some mismatched colors (especially hover and highlight colors in the UI), but I'll probably leave it as it is right now. To minimize the color mismatch, you can use the Frankfurt dark theme as a basis.

The fonts used are Fira Sans and Fira Code. You can get them from Google Fonts.

Most of the UI modifications are taken from @janpeeters Optimized Theme: https://forum.zettlr.com/discussion/comment/1107
