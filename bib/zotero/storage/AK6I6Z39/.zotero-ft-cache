Abstract:
The aim of this work is to achieve smooth multiple parallel paths (lanes) confined within a bounded volume (corridor) through controlled airspace in urban scenarios. The problem is formulated as two subproblems: cross-section planning and corridor planning. The corridor cross-section is optimized for minimizing the corridor width for the required number of parallel paths while taking into account the downwash effects. Corridor planning utilizes a modified A* algorithm for waypoint generation in conjunction with a logistic curve based path for smoothly connecting these waypoints while accounting for curvature limits of individual paths. Waypoint heading angles are optimized to find minimum length corridor. The work provides an optimal solution of corridor planning with the capability of accommodating multiple UAVs simultaneously.

Introduction

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a huge potential to be utilized in many sectors such as commercial, healthcare, media, film making, agriculture and military. Drone delivery is one of the major applications being developed by numerous commercial industries to facilitate faster product delivery services to customers [1] . The boom of drone deployment in many commercial sectors calls for the need of developing a centralized system that ensures de-confliction among the UAV paths and efficient usage of the available airspace. There has been much recent research focusing on development of an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management System (UTM) [2] , [3] and frameworks for on-demand point-to-point safe path generation in the available airspace for UAVs, such as CORRIDRONE [4] , [5] .

For single or multi UAV aerial transit, it is necessary to pre-plan a path [6] – [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] through the available airspace that does not intersect with the no-fly zones and other UAVs sharing the same airspace. In [6] , D ∗ -lite algorithm is used to generate obstacle free channels. A B-spline based path planning ensures the confinement of the curve to the available free channels. The solution obtained is computationally efficient and applicable to real time missions. Ref. [7] solves a sequential quadratic programming optimization problem to minimize the obstacle collision cost subject to a maximum curvature constraint. The waypoints were generated with the help of Voronoi diagram and then smoothed using cubic splines. Bézier curves and B-splines lie inside the convex hull of their control points and is useful for obstacle avoidance. In [8] , a four parameter logistic curve is used to generate smooth S-shaped and half S-shaped paths between waypoints. Two design parameter choices control the nature of the path obtained. The paths generated are constrained by the required curvature limits and the work also provides a convex hull for confinement region for the paths to obtain avoidance of the no-fly zones. Path planning considering air traffic while satisfying geofence and obstacle constraints is achieved in [13] . The repetitive algorithm provides a conflict free path to the destination with intermediate goal points satisfying minimum computational time suitable for systems with limited onboard computing resources.

Numerous solutions have been proposed to address the multi-UAV path planning problems [14] – [15] [16] [17] . In [14] , an iterative method is proposed to generate safe and continuously flyable paths for simultaneous arrival of UAV swarms using the Pythagoras Hodograph. The curvature for the path obtained is varied to satisfy the curvature bounds and ensure vehicle safety. The work presented in [15] solves the cooperative task assignment problem for uninhabited aerial vehicles by applying genetic algorithm to obtain near optimal solutions with reduced computational complexity. For multiple UAVs travelling between the same start and end destinations, planning a multi-lane corridor instead of different path for each UAV is a more space efficient and computationally light solution since only a single path is to be planned.

We present a novel approach that allows planning multilane corridors between the requested start and end destinations. The problem for planning a single corridor with multiple lanes has been formulated as a two stage optimization problem. The result of the first stage is an optimal corridor cross-section that can fit a given number of lanes inside the corridor and minimizes the inter-vehicular downwash effects. The corridor width calculated from this stage is used to obtain waypoints connecting the start and end destinations. A continuous and smooth path is obtained through these waypoints using an optimization approach that minimizes the total path length considering the curvature bounds for the vehicle and assuring no conflicts with the no-fly zones. The planned corridor also considers kinematic constraints of the vehicle to safely traverse through the corridor in the available airspace while minimizing the path length. The work provides an optimal corridor cross-section that places the lanes circumscribed inside the corridor taking into account the inter-vehicular disturbances.

The paper is organized into different sections as follows. Section II formalizes the problem statement for corridor planning and corridor cross-section optimization. Section III and IV provides the mathematical formulations to solve the corridor planning and cross-section optimization problem. Section V presents the simulation results for both the problems and finally Section VI contains the final concluding remarks and future directions for the project.
SECTION II.
Problem Formulation

Consider a typical scenario with polygonal shaped no-fly zones as shown in Fig. 1 . The no-fly zones are assumed to be static and convex shaped. The problem is to plan a multi-lane corridor connecting the desired start and end destinations that allows multiple UAVs to operate safely in close vicinity. This problem has been divided into two subproblems which are corridor cross-section optimization and corridor planning through the given airspace.

For a given number of lanes, the cross-section optimization addresses the problem for finding an optimal lane arrangement that

    minimizes the corridor radius

    maximizes the inter-lane distance so as to minimize the inter-vehicular aerodynamic downwash effect.

The next subproblem is to plan a feasible path in the given airspace from the start to end destination subject to the following conditions

    the planned path is smooth and has continuous curvature.

    the maximum curvature along the planned path is less than the maximum allowable vehicle curvature travelling through it.

    the path should not violate the no-fly zone boundaries.

SECTION III.
Cross-Section Optimization

This section presents an optimization based solution to determine an optimal lane arrangement inside a corridor considering inter-lane distances. The lane radius can be calculated based on the UAV dimensions and parameters such as vehicle compliance level and downwash profiles. An example for a corridor cross-section layout with 3 lanes is shown in Fig. 2 . A corridor cross-section centred coordinate frame is considered and the coordinates of i t h lane are denoted by c i ( x i , y i ) , i = 1 , 2 , … , n , where n is the number of lanes to be fit in the corridor.

The motivation for formulating an optimization based solution rather than an analytical solution lies in the fact that UAVs navigating in the same corridor can have different dimensions, rotor configuration and parameters that define its downwash profile and thus have different lane dimensions. Due to this reason, finding an analytical solution to this general problem becomes very challenging. The optimization based methodology can easily take into account these different parameter specifications in the form of individual constraints and generative safe and feasible lane arrangements inside the corridor cross-section. Although the examples in the following sections consider identical UAVs travelling in the corridor, the same formulation can be used for non-identical UAVs.
A. Compact Lane Packing

The compact lane packing problem is constructed as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem that tries to obtain a lane arrangement that minimizes the corridor radius Fig. 3a . For a n lane packing problem, 2 n + 1 optimization variables are used consisting of c i ,   i = 1 , 2 , … , n and the corridor radius d . A simple objective function to minimize d is used as shown below,
s . t . min x i , y i d ∥ c i ∥ ≤ ( d − r ) 2 , i = 1 , … , n ∥ c k − c i ∥ ≥ 4 r 2 , i = 1 , … , n − 1 , k = i + 1 , … , n (1)

The first constraint ensures that the lanes are circumscribed within the corridor width and the second constraint prevents the lanes from overlapping with each other. Although this formulation minimizes the corridor dimensions, thus reducing the airspace usage, it jeopardizes the safety for the UAVs travelling in the corridor by increasing the chances of collision and disrupting the neighbouring vehicles due to the downwash effect [18] – [19] [20] as shown in Fig. 4 .

B. Multi-Lane Corridor Cross-Section Optimization

The proposed solution factors in maximization of inter-lane distance to reduce downwash effect in addition to minimizing corridor radius as shown in Fig. 3b . The optimization problem is presented in (2) , where f i j is the effect of j t h lane on the i t h lane. This effect is modelled based on Fig. 4 , where the lane interaction is inversely proportional to the vertical separation. The effect reduces with the inter-lane horizontal separation and is nil when separation is greater than twice the lane radius.

SECTION IV.
Corridor Planning

Once the corridor radius is obtained from the cross-section optimization, the next step is to find a smooth feasible path connecting the start to end destination accounting for the curvature constraint and maintaining a clearance from the no-fly zones. The corridor planning stage is subdivided into two steps which are the intermediate waypoint generation and joining these waypoints by a smooth and continuous path. The detailed explanation is provided in the following subsections.
A. Waypoint Generation

The A ∗ algorithm is a sampling based informed search path planning algorithm [21] . It uses a cost function f ( n ) = g ( n ) + h ( n ) to guide its search in the provided search-space. The cost is calculated as a sum of two functions, the first g ( n ) being the calculated path length from the start node to the current node and the second is a heuristic function h ( n ) that is the minimum direct distance between the current node and goal node. The algorithm is complete and can provide sub-optimal solutions to the resolution given there exists a path connecting the start and end destination.

In this work, the traditional A ∗ algorithm is augmented with a curvature improvement step to generate the intermediate waypoints connecting the start and end destinations in the given airspace with polygonal no-fly zones. The no-fly zone boundaries are inflated by the corridor radius obtained from the cross-section optimization to accommodate the corridor width. This inflation of obstacle boundaries reduces the problem of fitting a corridor to planning a path for a point object. To account for a UAV deviating from its path due to unknown external disturbances resulting in corridor boundary violation and immediately breaching the nearest no-fly zone, a small clearance is added to the no-fly zone boundary that ensures a safe separation between corridor boundary and non-fly zones.
B. Relationship Between Lane and Corridor Curvature

Curvature is a measure of rate of change in direction of the curve at any given point. Let f ( x ) be a function parameterized over x , the curvature k ( x ) at any point x is to the inverse of the radius of curvature R ( x ) at that point as shown in (4) .
k ( x ) = 1 R ( x ) (4)

For a curved corridor section with n lanes, let the lane curvature for the i t h lane be defined as k i l and the corridor curvature be k c . Let the maximum curvature bound for the vehicle be k v m a x imposed due to its kinematic constraints. From Fig. 5 , it can be noted that the lane nearest to the center of curvature will have the minimum radius of curvature, and thus the maximum curvature k l m a x , while the lane farthest from the center of curvature will have the maximum radius of curvature, and thus the minimum curvature k l m i n . The curvature bound for the lanes can be related to k c as
k l m i n ≤ k c ≤ k l m a x (5)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} k_{min}^{l} \leq k^{c}\leq k_{max}^{l} \tag{5} \end{equation*}

To ensure that curvature for the axis of corridor and every lane in the corridor satisfies the maximum vehicle curvature constraint, k l m a x ≤ k v m a x should be satisfied. Since the path optimization with curvature constraint is performed for the central axis of the corridor, the maximum bound on the corridor axis curvature k c m a x is calculated as follows,
k c m a x = k l m a x μ k l m a x + 1 (6)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} k_{max}^{c}= \frac{k_{max}^{l}}{\mu k_{max}^{l}+1} \tag{6} \end{equation*}

C. Four-Parameter Logic Curve-Based Half-S Shaped Path

Four parameter logistic curve [8] , [22] – [23] [24] is used to generate a smooth and continuous-curvature path through the given set of n waypoints, where each waypoint is referred to as W i ,   i = 0 , 2 , … , n − 1 , as presented in Fig. 6 . A general 4PL curve equation is given by
y = y i − y i + 1 1 + ( x C ) B + y i + 1 , x ≥ 0 , B > 0 , C > 0 (7)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*}\begin{split} y&= \frac{y_{i}- y_{i+1}}{1+\left(\frac{x}{C}\right)^{B}}+ y_{i+1},\\ &x\geq 0, B > 0, C > 0 \end{split}\tag{7}\end{equation*} which is governed by four parameters y i ,   y i + 1 ,   B and C . Since the waypoint coordinates are fixed in the waypoint generation step, the only design parameters that define the shape of the curve are B and C . Fig. 7 shows a typical 4PL based half-S path. In the i t h local coordinate frame with W i as the origin, (7) can be re-written as
y ( x ) = y v − y v 1 + ( x C ) B (8)

For a curve with zero initial heading at W i and θ w as the final heading at W i + 1 , a unique solution can be found for B ,   C ,   y v and thus y ( x ) . This generates a half-S shaped path between the two waypoints which, when stitched together in the global reference frame, create a globally smooth path with continuous curvature.

A convex hull for each segment of the 4PL curve generated between two consecutive waypoints is formed which is termed as the confinement region as shown in Fig. 7 . For a given consecutive waypoints with the desired heading angles, the 4PL curve is guaranteed to lie within the confinement region irrespective of the design parameter values. This property of the confinement region has been utilized for avoiding the no-fly zones and is modelled as a constraint in the corridor planning optimization.
D. Waypoint Heading Optimization

We propose a non-linear constrained optimization technique to find a globally smooth 4PL curve fitting through the given n waypoints. The optimization is performed for deriving a set of absolute heading angles in the global frame at each waypoint. The motivation for choosing the heading angles as the optimization variables is that, for the given waypoints, a unique closed form solution is available for determining the 4PL curve parameters B and C by calculating the absolute heading angles at each of these waypoints. The objective of this optimization is to minimize the path length for the 4PL curve while satisfying the constraints. The optimization formulation for the corridor planning is given below,
s . t .   min θ w i ∑ i = 0 n − 1 ∫ w i w i + 1 d s tan − 1 ( 1.5 y w i + i | w i x w i + i | w i ) ≤ θ w i + 1 − θ w i ≤ π 2 k w i , w i + 1 ( s ) ≤ k c m a x , i = 0 , 1 , … , n − 1 R C ∩ R O = Φ (9)

R C and R O are the regions of confinement and no-fly zones respectively.

SECTION V.
Simulations

This section validates the formulations and presents the simulations performed for the corridor planning and cross-section optimization. The optimizations are performed using the fmincon non-linear constrained optimization tool available in the MATLAB optimization toolbox.
A. Cross-Section Optimization

The compact packing for the lanes is compared with the proposed method which accounts for the inter-vehicular distance in addition to minimizing the corridor radius. Fig. 8a illustrates the simulation result for obtaining a compact cross-section with 10 lanes that minimizes the corridor width. The optimized cross-section with 10 lanes obtained using the proposed method is shown in Fig. 8b . The arrangement of lanes along the circumference of the corridor and the horizontal diameter provides sufficient vertical separation along which the downwash effect is most pronounced. Lanes separated along the horizontal axis experience minimal downwash effects and can be placed with minimum vertical displacement. This technique provides a satisfactory trade-off between the corridor width and vehicle safety when travelling in close proximity.

B. Corridor Planning

A sample scenario with 5 rectangular no-fly zones is considered and a path is planned from the start point on the left to the end destination on the right as shown in Fig. 9 . The simulation results for obtaining a feasible corridor with 10 lanes generated in the previous section are described in the following subsections.

The waypoints obtained from the traditional A ∗ and the proposed A ∗ are marked by green and purple ‘×’, respectively. The red dotted lines represents the obstacle boundaries inflated by the corridor radius and the black dotted lines represent the additional clearance added to the obstacle boundaries over the corridor radius. The position of each waypoint, slope of each piece-wise linear path, and the changes in slopes between two consecutive paths are shown in the Table I . It can be noted that the changes in heading angles between two consecutive waypoints with the proposed A ∗ is lower than the traditional A ∗ algorithm. Lower changes in heading angles aids the corridor paths optimization to plan low curvature path and satisfy the vehicle kinematic constraints.

Conclusions

The work obtains an optimal solution of corridor planning with multiple lanes for traversing UAVs in scenarios with no-fly zones. Two subproblems of cross-section planning and corridor planning are dealt with. The corridor cross-section optimization minimized the corridor radius for a given number of lanes while factoring in the proposed inter-lane downwash effects. For the corridor planning, a modified A ∗ algorithm for waypoint generation is used to account for slope changes between the piece-wise linear segments connecting the consecutive waypoints. This reduced the possibility of an infeasible solution for smooth path generation between waypoints. A 4PL based half-S shaped path has been utilized for smooth joining of the generated waypoints. The solution also considers curvature limits of individual paths while minimizing the corridor length with heading angles as optimization variables. Simulation studies demonstrate the optimal generation of corridor between two points in a typical urban environment scenario.

The future works include utilizing a higher fidelity aerodynamic model for the downwash effect in the cross-section optimization. Since non-identical UAVs with different dimensions would have different lane radius and downwash profiles, the cross-section optimization formulation can be modified to find optimal arrangements with regards to safety and airspace requirement for such heterogeneous vehicles navigating in the same corridor. Another direction is to extend the work to multi-corridor planning with aerodynamic downwash modelling and considering the temporal aspects of the trajectory of drones through the corridor.
