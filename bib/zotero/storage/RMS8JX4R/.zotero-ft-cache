Chapter 1
Set Theory and Logic
We adopt, as most mathematicians do, the naive point of view regarding set theory. We shall assume that what is meant by a set of objects is intuitively clear, and we shall proceed on that basis without analyzing the concept further. Such an analysis properly belongs to the foundations of mathematics and to mathematical logic, and it is not our purpose to initiate the study of those ﬁelds.
Logicians have analyzed set theory in great detail, and they have formulated axioms for the subject. Each of their axioms expresses a property of sets that mathematicians commonly accept, and collectively the axioms provide a foundation broad enough and strong enough that the rest of mathematics can be built on them.
It is unfortunately true that careless use of set theory, relying on intuition alone, can lead to contradictions. Indeed, one of the reasons for the axiomatization of set theory was to formulate rules for dealing with sets that would avoid these contradictions. Although we shall not deal with the axioms explicitly, the rules we follow in dealing with sets derive from them. In this book, you will learn how to deal with sets in an “apprentice” fashion, by observing how we handle them and by working with them yourself. At some point of your studies, you may wish to study set theory more carefully and in greater detail; then a course in logic or foundations will be in order.

Ch. 1

§1 Fundamental Concepts
Here we introduce the ideas of set theory, and establish the basic terminology and notation. We also discuss some points of elementary logic that, in our experience, are apt to cause confusion.

Basic Notation
Commonly we shall use capital letters A, B, . . . to denote sets, and lowercase letters a, b, . . . to denote the objects or elements belonging to these sets. If an object a belongs to a set A, we express this fact by the notation

a ∈ A.

If a does not belong to A, we express this fact by writing

a ∈/ A.

The equality symbol = is used throughout this book to mean logical identity. Thus,

when we write a = b, we mean that “a” and “b” are symbols for the same object. This

is

what

one

means

in

arithmetic,

for

example,

when

one

writes

2 4

=

1 2

.

Similarly,

the

equation A = B states that “A” and “B” are symbols for the same set; that is, A and B

consist of precisely the same objects.

If a and b are different objects, we write a = b; and if A and B are different sets,

we write A = B. For example, if A is the set of all nonnegative real numbers, and B

is the set of all positive real numbers, then A = B, because the number 0 belongs to A

and not to B.

We say that A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B; and

we express this fact by writing

A ⊂ B.

Nothing in this deﬁnition requires A to be different from B; in fact, if A = B, it is true that both A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A. If A ⊂ B and A is different from B, we say that A is a proper subset of B, and we write

A B.

The relations ⊂ and are called inclusion and proper inclusion, respectively. If A ⊂ B, we also write B ⊃ A, which is read “B contains A.”
How does one go about specifying a set? If the set has only a few elements, one can simply list the objects in the set, writing “A is the set consisting of the elements a, b, and c.” In symbols, this statement becomes

A = {a, b, c},

where braces are used to enclose the list of elements.

The usual way to specify a set, however, is to take some set A of objects and some property that elements of A may or may not possess, and to form the set consisting of all elements of A having that property. For instance, one might take the set of real numbers and form the subset B consisting of all even integers. In symbols, this statement becomes
B = {x | x is an even integer}.
Here the braces stand for the words “the set of,” and the vertical bar stands for the words “such that.” The equation is read “B is the set of all x such that x is an even integer.”

The Union of Sets and the Meaning of “or”
Given two sets A and B, one can form a set from them that consists of all the elements of A together with all the elements of B. This set is called the union of A and B and is denoted by A ∪ B. Formally, we deﬁne
A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.
But we must pause at this point and make sure exactly what we mean by the statement “x ∈ A or x ∈ B.”
In ordinary everyday English, the word “or” is ambiguous. Sometimes the statement “P or Q” means “P or Q, or both” and sometimes it means “P or Q, but not both.” Usually one decides from the context which meaning is intended. For example, suppose I spoke to two students as follows:
“Miss Smith, every student registered for this course has taken either a course in linear algebra or a course in analysis.”
“Mr. Jones, either you get a grade of at least 70 on the ﬁnal exam or you will ﬂunk this course.”
In the context, Miss Smith knows perfectly well that I mean “everyone has had linear algebra or analysis, or both,” and Mr. Jones knows I mean “either he gets at least 70 or he ﬂunks, but not both.” Indeed, Mr. Jones would be exceedingly unhappy if both statements turned out to be true!
In mathematics, one cannot tolerate such ambiguity. One has to pick just one meaning and stick with it, or confusion will reign. Accordingly, mathematicians have agreed that they will use the word “or” in the ﬁrst sense, so that the statement “P or Q” always means “P or Q, or both.” If one means “P or Q, but not both,” then one has to include the phrase “but not both” explicitly.
With this understanding, the equation deﬁning A ∪ B is unambiguous; it states that A ∪ B is the set consisting of all elements x that belong to A or to B or to both.

Ch. 1

The Intersection of Sets, the Empty Set, and the Meaning of “If . . . Then”
Given sets A and B, another way one can form a set is to take the common part of A and B. This set is called the intersection of A and B and is denoted by A∩B. Formally, we deﬁne
A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.
But just as with the deﬁnition of A ∪ B, there is a difﬁculty. The difﬁculty is not in the meaning of the word “and”; it is of a different sort. It arises when the sets A and B happen to have no elements in common. What meaning does the symbol A ∩ B have in such a case?
To take care of this eventuality, we make a special convention. We introduce a special set that we call the empty set, denoted by ∅, which we think of as “the set having no elements.”
Using this convention, we express the statement that A and B have no elements in common by the equation
A ∩ B = ∅.
We also express this fact by saying that A and B are disjoint. Now some students are bothered by the notion of an “empty set.” “How,” they say,
“can you have a set with nothing in it?” The problem is similar to that which arose many years ago when the number 0 was ﬁrst introduced.
The empty set is only a convention, and mathematics could very well get along without it. But it is a very convenient convention, for it saves us a good deal of awkwardness in stating theorems and in proving them. Without this convention, for instance, one would have to prove that the two sets A and B do have elements in common before one could use the notation A ∩ B. Similarly, the notation
C = {x | x ∈ A and x has a certain property}
could not be used if it happened that no element x of A had the given property. It is much more convenient to agree that A ∩ B and C equal the empty set in such cases.
Since the empty set ∅ is merely a convention, we must make conventions relating it to the concepts already introduced. Because ∅ is thought of as “the set with no elements,” it is clear we should make the convention that for each object x, the relation x ∈ ∅ does not hold. Similarly, the deﬁnitions of union and intersection show that for every set A we should have the equations
A ∪ ∅ = A and A ∩ ∅ = ∅.
The inclusion relation is a bit more tricky. Given a set A, should we agree that ∅ ⊂ A? Once more, we must be careful about the way mathematicians use the English language. The expression ∅ ⊂ A is a shorthand way of writing the sentence, “Every element that belongs to the empty set also belongs to the set A.” Or to put it more

formally, “For every object x, if x belongs to the empty set, then x also belongs to the set A.”
Is this statement true or not? Some might say “yes” and others say “no.” You will never settle the question by argument, only by agreement. This is a statement of the form “If P, then Q,” and in everyday English the meaning of the “if . . . then” construction is ambiguous. It always means that if P is true, then Q is true also. Sometimes that is all it means; other times it means something more: that if P is false, Q must be false. Usually one decides from the context which interpretation is correct.
The situation is similar to the ambiguity in the use of the word “or.” One can reformulate the examples involving Miss Smith and Mr. Jones to illustrate the ambiguity. Suppose I said the following:
“Miss Smith, if any student registered for this course has not taken a course in linear algebra, then he has taken a course in analysis.”
“Mr. Jones, if you get a grade below 70 on the ﬁnal, you are going to ﬂunk this course.”
In the context, Miss Smith understands that if a student in the course has not had linear algebra, then he has taken analysis, but if he has had linear algebra, he may or may not have taken analysis as well. And Mr. Jones knows that if he gets a grade below 70, he will ﬂunk the course, but if he gets a grade of at least 70, he will pass.
Again, mathematics cannot tolerate ambiguity, so a choice of meanings must be made. Mathematicians have agreed always to use “if . . . then” in the ﬁrst sense, so that a statement of the form “If P, then Q” means that if P is true, Q is true also, but if P is false, Q may be either true or false.
As an example, consider the following statement about real numbers:
If x > 0, then x3 = 0.
It is a statement of the form, “If P, then Q,” where P is the phrase “x > 0” (called the hypothesis of the statement) and Q is the phrase “x3 = 0” (called the conclusion of the statement). This is a true statement, for in every case for which the hypothesis x > 0 holds, the conclusion x3 = 0 holds as well.
Another true statement about real numbers is the following:
If x2 < 0, then x = 23;
in every case for which the hypothesis holds, the conclusion holds as well. Of course, it happens in this example that there are no cases for which the hypothesis holds. A statement of this sort is sometimes said to be vacuously true.
To return now to the empty set and inclusion, we see that the inclusion ∅ ⊂ A does hold for every set A. Writing ∅ ⊂ A is the same as saying, “If x ∈ ∅, then x ∈ A,” and this statement is vacuously true.

Ch. 1

Contrapositive and Converse
Our discussion of the “if . . . then” construction leads us to consider another point of elementary logic that sometimes causes difﬁculty. It concerns the relation between a statement, its contrapositive, and its converse.
Given a statement of the form “If P, then Q,” its contrapositive is deﬁned to be the statement “If Q is not true, then P is not true.” For example, the contrapositive of the statement
If x > 0, then x3 = 0,

is the statement

If x3 = 0, then it is not true that x > 0.

Note that both the statement and its contrapositive are true. Similarly, the statement If x2 < 0, then x = 23,

has as its contrapositive the statement If x = 23, then it is not true that x2 < 0.

Again, both are true statements about real numbers. These examples may make you suspect that there is some relation between a state-
ment and its contrapositive. And indeed there is; they are two ways of saying precisely the same thing. Each is true if and only if the other is true; they are logically equivalent.
This fact is not hard to demonstrate. Let us introduce some notation ﬁrst. As a shorthand for the statement “If P, then Q,” we write

P ⇒ Q,

which is read “P implies Q.” The contrapositive can then be expressed in the form

(not Q) ⇒ (not P),

where “not Q” stands for the phrase “Q is not true.” Now the only way in which the statement “P ⇒ Q” can fail to be correct is if the
hypothesis P is true and the conclusion Q is false. Otherwise it is correct. Similarly, the only way in which the statement (not Q) ⇒ (not P) can fail to be correct is if the hypothesis “not Q” is true and the conclusion “not P” is false. This is the same as saying that Q is false and P is true. And this, in turn, is precisely the situation in which P ⇒ Q fails to be correct. Thus, we see that the two statements are either both correct or both incorrect; they are logically equivalent. Therefore, we shall accept a proof of the statement “not Q ⇒ not P” as a proof of the statement “P ⇒ Q.”
There is another statement that can be formed from the statement P ⇒ Q. It is the statement

Q ⇒ P,

6

§1

Fundamental Concepts

which is called the converse of P ⇒ Q. One must be careful to distinguish between a statement’s converse and its contrapositive. Whereas a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the truth of a statement says nothing at all about the truth or falsity of its converse. For example, the true statement
If x > 0, then x3 = 0,
has as its converse the statement If x3 = 0, then x > 0,
which is false. Similarly, the true statement If x2 < 0, then x = 23,
has as its converse the statement If x = 23, then x2 < 0,
which is false. If it should happen that both the statement P ⇒ Q and its converse Q ⇒ P are
true, we express this fact by the notation
P ⇐⇒ Q,
which is read “P holds if and only if Q holds.”

Negation
If one wishes to form the contrapositive of the statement P ⇒ Q, one has to know how to form the statement “not P,” which is called the negation of P. In many cases, this causes no difﬁculty; but sometimes confusion occurs with statements involving the phrases “for every” and “for at least one.” These phrases are called logical quantiﬁers.
To illustrate, suppose that X is a set, A is a subset of X , and P is a statement about the general element of X . Consider the following statement:

(∗)

For every x ∈ A, statement P holds.

How does one form the negation of this statement? Let us translate the problem into the language of sets. Suppose that we let B denote the set of all those elements x of X for which P holds. Then statement (∗) is just the statement that A is a subset of B. What is its negation? Obviously, the statement that A is not a subset of B; that is, the statement that there exists at least one element of A that does not belong to B. Translating back into ordinary language, this becomes

For at least one x ∈ A, statement P does not hold.

Therefore, to form the negation of statement (∗), one replaces the quantiﬁer “for every” by the quantiﬁer “for at least one,” and one replaces statement P by its negation.

Ch. 1

The process works in reverse just as well; the negation of the statement For at least one x ∈ A, statement Q holds,
is the statement For every x ∈ A, statement Q does not hold.

The Difference of Two Sets
We return now to our discussion of sets. There is one other operation on sets that is occasionally useful. It is the difference of two sets, denoted by A − B, and deﬁned as the set consisting of those elements of A that are not in B. Formally,
A − B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈/ B}.
It is sometimes called the complement of B relative to A, or the complement of B in A. Our three set operations are represented schematically in Figure 1.1.

Rules of Set Theory
Given several sets, one may form new sets by applying the set-theoretic operations to them. As in algebra, one uses parentheses to indicate in what order the operations are to be performed. For example, A ∪ (B ∩ C) denotes the union of the two sets A and B ∩ C, while (A ∪ B) ∩ C denotes the intersection of the two sets A ∪ B and C. The sets thus formed are quite different, as Figure 1.2 shows.

Sometimes different combinations of operations lead to the same set; when that happens, one has a rule of set theory. For instance, it is true that for any sets A, B, and C the equation
A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
holds. The equation is illustrated in Figure 1.3; the shaded region represents the set in question, as you can check mentally. This equation can be thought of as a “distributive law” for the operations ∩ and ∪.

C
Figure 1.3
Other examples of set-theoretic rules include the second “distributive law,”
A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C),
and DeMorgan’s laws,
A − (B ∪ C) = (A − B) ∩ (A − C), A − (B ∩ C) = (A − B) ∪ (A − C).
We leave it to you to check these rules. One can state other rules of set theory, but these are the most important ones. DeMorgan’s laws are easier to remember if you verbalize them as follows:
The complement of the union equals the intersection of the complements. The complement of the intersection equals the union of the complements.
Collections of Sets The objects belonging to a set may be of any sort. One can consider the set of all even integers, and the set of all blue-eyed people in Nebraska, and the set of all decks of playing cards in the world. Some of these are of limited mathematical interest, we admit! But the third example illustrates a point we have not yet mentioned: namely, that the objects belonging to a set may themselves be sets. For a deck of cards is itself a set, one consisting of pieces of pasteboard with certain standard designs printed on them. The set of all decks of cards in the world is thus a set whose elements are themselves sets (of pieces of pasteboard).

12 Set Theory and Logic

Ch. 1

We now have another way to form new sets from old ones. Given a set A, we can consider sets whose elements are subsets of A. In particular, we can consider the set of all subsets of A. This set is sometimes denoted by the symbol P (A) and is called the power set of A (for reasons to be explained later).
When we have a set whose elements are sets, we shall often refer to it as a collection of sets and denote it by a script letter such as A or B. This device will help us in keeping things straight in arguments where we have to consider objects, and sets of objects, and collections of sets of objects, all at the same time. For example, we might use A to denote the collection of all decks of cards in the world, letting an ordinary capital letter A denote a deck of cards and a lowercase letter a denote a single playing card.
A certain amount of care with notation is needed at this point. We make a distinction between the object a, which is an element of a set A, and the one-element set {a}, which is a subset of A. To illustrate, if A is the set {a, b, c}, then the statements
a ∈ A, {a} ⊂ A, and {a} ∈ P (A)
are all correct, but the statements {a} ∈ A and a ⊂ A are not.

Arbitrary Unions and Intersections
We have already deﬁned what we mean by the union and the intersection of two sets. There is no reason to limit ourselves to just two sets, for we can just as well form the union and intersection of arbitrarily many sets.
Given a collection A of sets, the union of the elements of A is deﬁned by the equation
A = {x | x ∈ A for at least one A ∈ A}.
A∈A
The intersection of the elements of A is deﬁned by the equation
A = {x | x ∈ A for every A ∈ A}.
A∈A
There is no problem with these deﬁnitions if one of the elements of A happens to be the empty set. But it is a bit tricky to decide what (if anything) these deﬁnitions mean if we allow A to be the empty collection. Applying the deﬁnitions literally, we see that no element x satisﬁes the deﬁning property for the union of the elements of A. So it is reasonable to say that
A=∅
A∈A
if A is empty. On the other hand, every x satisﬁes (vacuously) the deﬁning property for the intersection of the elements of A. The question is, every x in what set? If one has a given large set X that is speciﬁed at the outset of the discussion to be one’s “universe of discourse,” and one considers only subsets of X throughout, it is reasonable to let
A=X
A∈A

10

§1

13

when A is empty. Not all mathematicians follow this convention, however. To avoid difﬁculty, we shall not deﬁne the intersection when A is empty.

Cartesian Products
There is yet another way of forming new sets from old ones; it involves the notion of an “ordered pair” of objects. When you studied analytic geometry, the ﬁrst thing you did was to convince yourself that after one has chosen an x-axis and a y-axis in the plane, every point in the plane can be made to correspond to a unique ordered pair (x, y) of real numbers. (In a more sophisticated treatment of geometry, the plane is more likely to be deﬁned as the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers!)
The notion of ordered pair carries over to general sets. Given sets A and B, we deﬁne their cartesian product A × B to be the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) for which a is an element of A and b is an element of B. Formally,
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B}.
This deﬁnition assumes that the concept of “ordered pair” is already given. It can be taken as a primitive concept, as was the notion of “set”; or it can be given a deﬁnition in terms of the set operations already introduced. One deﬁnition in terms of set operations is expressed by the equation
(a, b) = {{a}, {a, b}};
it deﬁnes the ordered pair (a, b) as a collection of sets. If a = b, this deﬁnition says that (a, b) is a collection containing two sets, one of which is a one-element set and the other a two-element set. The ﬁrst coordinate of the ordered pair is deﬁned to be the element belonging to both sets, and the second coordinate is the element belonging to only one of the sets. If a = b, then (a, b) is a collection containing only one set {a}, since {a, b} = {a, a} = {a} in this case. Its ﬁrst coordinate and second coordinate both equal the element in this single set.
I think it is fair to say that most mathematicians think of an ordered pair as a primitive concept rather than thinking of it as a collection of sets!
Let us make a comment on notation. It is an unfortunate fact that the notation (a, b) is ﬁrmly established in mathematics with two entirely different meanings. One meaning, as an ordered pair of objects, we have just discussed. The other meaning is the one you are familiar with from analysis; if a and b are real numbers, the symbol (a, b) is used to denote the interval consisting of all numbers x such that a < x < b. Most of the time, this conﬂict in notation will cause no difﬁculty because the meaning will be clear from the context. Whenever a situation occurs where confusion is possible, we shall adopt a different notation for the ordered pair (a, b), denoting it by the symbol
a×b
instead.

§2 Functions
The concept of function is one you have seen many times already, so it is hardly necessary to remind you how central it is to all mathematics. In this section, we give the precise mathematical deﬁnition, and we explore some of the associated concepts.
A function is usually thought of as a rule that assigns to each element of a set A, an element of a set B. In calculus, a function is often given by a simple formula such as f (x) = 3x2 + 2 or perhaps by a more complicated formula such as
∞
f (x) = xk.
k=1
One often does not even mention the sets A and B explicitly, agreeing to take A to be the set of all real numbers for which the rule makes sense and B to be the set of all real numbers.
As one goes further in mathematics, however, one needs to be more precise about what a function is. Mathematicians think of functions in the way we just described, but the deﬁnition they use is more exact. First, we deﬁne the following:
Deﬁnition. A rule of assignment is a subset r of the cartesian product C × D of two sets, having the property that each element of C appears as the ﬁrst coordinate of at most one ordered pair belonging to r .

13

16 Set Theory and Logic

Ch. 1

Thus, a subset r of C × D is a rule of assignment if
[(c, d) ∈ r and (c, d ) ∈ r ] ⇒ [d = d ].
We think of r as a way of assigning, to the element c of C, the element d of D for which (c, d) ∈ r .
Given a rule of assignment r , the domain of r is deﬁned to be the subset of C consisting of all ﬁrst coordinates of elements of r , and the image set of r is deﬁned as the subset of D consisting of all second coordinates of elements of r . Formally,
domain r = {c | there exists d ∈ D such that (c, d) ∈ r }, image r = {d | there exists c ∈ C such that (c, d) ∈ r }.
Note that given a rule of assignment r , its domain and image are entirely determined. Now we can say what a function is.
Deﬁnition. A function f is a rule of assignment r , together with a set B that contains the image set of r . The domain A of the rule r is also called the domain of the function f ; the image set of r is also called the image set of f ; and the set B is called the range of f .†
If f is a function having domain A and range B, we express this fact by writing
f : A −→ B,
which is read “ f is a function from A to B,” or “ f is a mapping from A into B,” or simply “ f maps A into B.” One sometimes visualizes f as a geometric transformation physically carrying the points of A to points of B.
If f : A → B and if a is an element of A, we denote by f (a) the unique element of B that the rule determining f assigns to a; it is called the value of f at a, or sometimes the image of a under f . Formally, if r is the rule of the function f , then f (a) denotes the unique element of B such that (a, f (a)) ∈ r .
Using this notation, one can go back to deﬁning functions almost as one did before, with no lack of rigor. For instance, one can write (letting R denote the real numbers)
“Let f be the function whose rule is {(x, x3 + 1) | x ∈ R} and whose range is R,”
or one can equally well write
“Let f : R → R be the function such that f (x) = x3 + 1.”
Both sentences specify precisely the same function. But the sentence “Let f be the function f (x) = x3 + 1” is no longer adequate for specifying a function because it speciﬁes neither the domain nor the range of f .
†Analysts are apt to use the word “range” to denote what we have called the “image set” of f . They avoid giving the set B a name.

Deﬁnition. If f : A → B and if A0 is a subset of A, we deﬁne the restriction of f to A0 to be the function mapping A0 into B whose rule is

{(a, f (a)) | a ∈ A0}.

It is denoted by f |A0, which is read “ f restricted to A0.”

EXAMPLE 1. Let R denote the real numbers and let R¯ + denote the nonnegative reals. Consider the functions

f : R −→ R
g : R¯ + −→ R h : R −→ R¯ + k : R¯ + −→ R¯ +

deﬁned by deﬁned by deﬁned by deﬁned by

f (x) = x2, g(x) = x2, h(x) = x2, k(x) = x2.

The function g is different from the function f because their rules are different subsets of R × R; it is the restriction of f to the set R¯ +. The function h is also different from f , even though their rules are the same set, because the range speciﬁed for h is different from the range speciﬁed for f . The function k is different from all of these. These functions are pictured in Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1 Restricting the domain of a function and changing its range are two ways of forming a new function from an old one. Another way is to form the composite of two functions. Deﬁnition. Given functions f : A → B and g : B → C, we deﬁne the composite g ◦ f of f and g as the function g ◦ f : A → C deﬁned by the equation (g ◦ f )(a) = g( f (a)). Formally, g ◦ f : A → C is the function whose rule is
{(a, c) | For some b ∈ B, f (a) = b and g(b) = c}. We often picture the composite g ◦ f as involving a physical movement of the point a to the point f (a), and then to the point g( f (a)), as illustrated in Figure 2.2.
Note that g ◦ f is deﬁned only when the range of f equals the domain of g.

EXAMPLE 2. The composite of the function f : R → R given by f (x) = 3x2 + 2 and the function g : R → R given by g(x) = 5x is the function g ◦ f : R → R given by
(g ◦ f )(x) = g( f (x)) = g(3x2 + 2) = 5(3x2 + 2).
The composite f ◦ g can also be formed in this case; it is the quite different function f ◦ g : R → R given by
( f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)) = f (5x) = 3(5x)2 + 2.
Deﬁnition. A function f : A → B is said to be injective (or one-to-one) if for each pair of distinct points of A, their images under f are distinct. It is said to be surjective (or f is said to map A onto B) if every element of B is the image of some element of A under the function f . If f is both injective and surjective, it is said to be bijective (or is called a one-to-one correspondence).
More formally, f is injective if
[ f (a) = f (a )] ⇒ [a = a ],
and f is surjective if
[b ∈ B] ⇒ [b = f (a) for at least one a ∈ A].
Injectivity of f depends only on the rule of f ; surjectivity depends on the range of f as well. You can check that the composite of two injective functions is injective, and the composite of two surjective functions is surjective; it follows that the composite of two bijective functions is bijective.
If f is bijective, there exists a function from B to A called the inverse of f . It is denoted by f −1 and is deﬁned by letting f −1(b) be that unique element a of A for which f (a) = b. Given b ∈ B, the fact that f is surjective implies that there exists such an element a ∈ A; the fact that f is injective implies that there is only one such element a. It is easy to see that if f is bijective, f −1 is also bijective.

EXAMPLE 3. Consider again the functions f , g, h, and k of Figure 2.1. The function f : R → R given by f (x) = x2 is neither injective nor surjective. Its restriction g to the nonnegative reals is injective but not surjective. The function h : R → R¯ + obtained from f

16

§2

by changing the range is surjective but not injective. The function k : R¯ + → R¯ + obtained from f by restricting the domain and changing the range is both injective and surjective, so it has an inverse. Its inverse is, of course, what we usually call the square-root function.
A useful criterion for showing that a given function f is bijective is the following, whose proof is left to the exercises:
Lemma 2.1. Let f : A → B. If there are functions g : B → A and h : B → A such that g( f (a)) = a for every a in A and f (h(b)) = b for every b in B, then f is bijective and g = h = f −1.

Deﬁnition. Let f : A → B. If A0 is a subset of A, we denote by f ( A0) the set of all images of points of A0 under the function f ; this set is called the image of A0 under f . Formally,
f ( A0) = {b | b = f (a) for at least one a ∈ A0}.
On the other hand, if B0 is a subset of B, we denote by f −1(B0) the set of all elements of A whose images under f lie in B0; it is called the preimage of B0 under f (or the “counterimage,” or the “inverse image,” of B0). Formally,
f −1(B0) = {a | f (a) ∈ B0}.
Of course, there may be no points a of A whose images lie in B0; in that case, f −1(B0) is empty.
Note that if f : A → B is bijective and B0 ⊂ B, we have two meanings for the notation f −1(B0). It can be taken to denote the preimage of B0 under the function f or to denote the image of B0 under the function f −1 : B → A. These two meanings give precisely the same subset of A, however, so there is, in fact, no ambiguity.
Some care is needed if one is to use the f and f −1 notation correctly. The operation f −1, for instance, when applied to subsets of B, behaves very nicely; it preserves inclusions, unions, intersections, and differences of sets. We shall use this fact frequently. But the operation f , when applied to subsets of A, preserves only inclusions and unions. See Exercises 2 and 3.
As another situation where care is needed, we note that it is not in general true that f −1( f ( A0)) = A0 and f ( f −1(B0)) = B0. (See the following example.) The relevant rules, which we leave to you to check, are the following: If f : A → B and if A0 ⊂ A and B0 ⊂ B, then
A0 ⊂ f −1( f ( A0)) and f ( f −1(B0)) ⊂ B0.
The ﬁrst inclusion is an equality if f is injective, and the second inclusion is an equality if f is surjective.

§3 Relations
A concept that is, in some ways, more general than that of function is the concept of a relation. In this section, we deﬁne what mathematicians mean by a relation, and we consider two types of relations that occur with great frequency in mathematics: equivalence relations and order relations. Order relations will be used throughout the book; equivalence relations will not be used until §22.
Deﬁnition. A relation on a set A is a subset C of the cartesian product A × A.
If C is a relation on A, we use the notation xC y to mean the same thing as (x, y) ∈ C. We read it “x is in the relation C to y.”
A rule of assignment r for a function f : A → A is also a subset of A × A. But it is a subset of a very special kind: namely, one such that each element of A appears as the ﬁrst coordinate of an element of r exactly once. Any subset of A × A is a relation on A.

Ch. 1

EXAMPLE 1. Let P denote the set of all people in the world, and deﬁne D ⊂ P × P by the equation
D = {(x, y) | x is a descendant of y}.
Then D is a relation on the set P. The statements “x is in the relation D to y” and “x is a descendant of y” mean precisely the same thing, namely, that (x, y) ∈ D. Two other relations on P are the following:
B = {(x, y) | x has an ancestor who is also an ancestor of y}, S = {(x, y) | the parents of x are the parents of y}.
We can call B the “blood relation” (pun intended), and we can call S the “sibling relation.” These three relations have quite different properties. The blood relationship is symmetric, for instance (if x is a blood relative of y, then y is a blood relative of x), whereas the descendant relation is not. We shall consider these relations again shortly.

Equivalence Relations and Partitions
An equivalence relation on a set A is a relation C on A having the following three properties:
(1) (Reﬂexivity) xC x for every x in A. (2) (Symmetry) If xC y, then yC x. (3) (Transitivity) If xC y and yC z, then xC z.
EXAMPLE 2. Among the relations deﬁned in Example 1, the descendant relation D is neither reﬂexive nor symmetric, while the blood relation B is not transitive (I am not a blood relation to my wife, although my children are!) The sibling relation S is, however, an equivalence relation, as you may check.
There is no reason one must use a capital letter—or indeed a letter of any sort— to denote a relation, even though it is a set. Another symbol will do just as well. One symbol that is frequently used to denote an equivalence relation is the “tilde” symbol ∼. Stated in this notation, the properties of an equivalence relation become
(1) x ∼ x for every x in A. (2) If x ∼ y, then y ∼ x. (3) If x ∼ y and y ∼ z, then x ∼ z. There are many other symbols that have been devised to stand for particular equivalence relations; we shall meet some of them in the pages of this book.
Given an equivalence relation ∼ on a set A and an element x of A, we deﬁne a certain subset E of A, called the equivalence class determined by x, by the equation
E = {y | y ∼ x}.
Note that the equivalence class E determined by x contains x, since x ∼ x. Equivalence classes have the following property:

20

§3

Relations

23

Lemma 3.1. Two equivalence classes E and E are either disjoint or equal.
Proof. Let E be the equivalence class determined by x, and let E be the equivalence class determined by x . Suppose that E ∩ E is not empty; let y be a point of E ∩ E . See Figure 3.1. We show that E = E .

E

Figure 3.1
By deﬁnition, we have y ∼ x and y ∼ x . Symmetry allows us to conclude that x ∼ y and y ∼ x ; from transitivity it follows that x ∼ x . If now w is any point of E, we have w ∼ x by deﬁnition; it follows from another application of transitivity that w ∼ x . We conclude that E ⊂ E .
The symmetry of the situation allows us to conclude that E ⊂ E as well, so that E=E.
Given an equivalence relation on a set A, let us denote by E the collection of all the equivalence classes determined by this relation. The preceding lemma shows that distinct elements of E are disjoint. Furthermore, the union of the elements of E equals all of A because every element of A belongs to an equivalence class. The collection E is a particular example of what is called a partition of A:
Deﬁnition. A partition of a set A is a collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of A whose union is all of A.
Studying equivalence relations on a set A and studying partitions of A are really the same thing. Given any partition D of A, there is exactly one equivalence relation on A from which it is derived.
The proof is not difﬁcult. To show that the partition D comes from some equivalence relation, let us deﬁne a relation C on A by setting xC y if x and y belong to the same element of D. Symmetry of C is obvious; reﬂexivity follows from the fact that the union of the elements of D equals all of A; transitivity follows from the fact that distinct elements of D are disjoint. It is simple to check that the collection of equivalence classes determined by C is precisely the collection D.
To show there is only one such equivalence relation, suppose that C1 and C2 are two equivalence relations on A that give rise to the same collection of equivalence classes D. Given x ∈ A, we show that yC1x if and only if yC2x, from which we conclude that C1 = C2. Let E1 be the equivalence class determined by x relative to the relation C1; let E2 be the equivalence class determined by x relative to the relation C2. Then E1 is an element of D, so that it must equal the unique element D of D that

21

24 Set Theory and Logic

Ch. 1

contains x. Similarly, E2 must equal D. Now by deﬁnition. E1 consists of all y such that yC1x; and E2 consists of all y such that yC2x. Since E1 = D = E2, our result is proved.
EXAMPLE 3. Deﬁne two points in the plane to be equivalent if they lie at the same distance from the origin. Reﬂexivity, symmetry, and transitivity hold trivially. The collection E of equivalence classes consists of all circles centered at the origin, along with the set consisting of the origin alone.
EXAMPLE 4. Deﬁne two points of the plane to be equivalent if they have the same y-coordinate. The collection of equivalence classes is the collection of all straight lines in the plane parallel to the x-axis.
EXAMPLE 5. Let L be the collection of all straight lines in the plane parallel to the line y = −x. Then L is a partition of the plane, since each point lies on exactly one such line. The partition L comes from the equivalence relation on the plane that declares the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) to be equivalent if x0 + y0 = x1 + y1.
EXAMPLE 6. Let L be the collection of all straight lines in the plane. Then L is not a partition of the plane, for distinct elements of L are not necessarily disjoint; two lines may intersect without being equal.

Order Relations
A relation C on a set A is called an order relation (or a simple order, or a linear order) if it has the following properties:
(1) (Comparability) For every x and y in A for which x = y, either xC y or yC x.
(2) (Nonreﬂexivity) For no x in A does the relation xC x hold.
(3) (Transitivity) If xC y and yC z, then xC z. Note that property (1) does not by itself exclude the possibility that for some pair of elements x and y of A, both the relations xC y and yC x hold (since “or” means “one or the other, or both”). But properties (2) and (3) combined do exclude this possibility; for if both xC y and yC x held, transitivity would imply that xC x, contradicting nonreﬂexivity.
EXAMPLE 7. Consider the relation on the real line consisting of all pairs (x, y) of real numbers such that x < y. It is an order relation, called the “usual order relation,” on the real line. A less familiar order relation on the real line is the following: Deﬁne xC y if x2 < y2, or if x2 = y2 and x < y. You can check that this is an order relation.
EXAMPLE 8. Consider again the relationships among people given in Example 1. The blood relation B satisﬁes none of the properties of an order relation, and the sibling relation S satisﬁes only (3). The descendant relation D does somewhat better, for it satisﬁes both (2) and (3); however, comparability still fails. Relations that satisfy (2) and (3) occur often enough in mathematics to be given a special name. They are called strict partial order relations; we shall consider them later (see §11).

22

§3

Relations

25

As the tilde, ∼, is the generic symbol for an equivalence relation, the “less than” symbol, <, is commonly used to denote an order relation. Stated in this notation, the properties of an order relation become
(1) If x = y, then either x < y or y < x. (2) If x < y, then x = y. (3) If x < y and y < z, then x < z. We shall use the notation x ≤ y to stand for the statement “either x < y or x = y”; and we shall use the notation y > x to stand for the statement “x < y.” We write x < y < z to mean “x < y and y < z.”
Deﬁnition. If X is a set and < is an order relation on X , and if a < b, we use the notation (a, b) to denote the set
{x | a < x < b};
it is called an open interval in X . If this set is empty, we call a the immediate predecessor of b, and we call b the immediate successor of a.

Deﬁnition. Suppose that A and B are two sets with order relations <A and <B respectively. We say that A and B have the same order type if there is a bijective correspondence between them that preserves order; that is, if there exists a bijective function f : A → B such that
a1 <A a2 ⇒ f (a1) <B f (a2).
EXAMPLE 9. The interval (−1, 1) of real numbers has the same order type as the set R of real numbers itself, for the function f : (−1, 1) → R given by
x f (x) = 1 − x2 is an order-preserving bijective correspondence, as you can check. It is pictured in Figure 3.2.
EXAMPLE 10. The subset A = {0} ∪ (1, 2) of R has the same order type as the subset
[0, 1) = {x | 0 ≤ x < 1}
of R. The function f : A → [0, 1) deﬁned by
f (0) = 0, f (x) = x − 1 for x ∈ (1, 2)
is the required order-preserving correspondence.
One interesting way of deﬁning an order relation, which will be useful to us later in dealing with some examples, is the following:

23

26 Set Theory and Logic

y = x / (1 − x2)

Ch. 1

Figure 3.2
Deﬁnition. Suppose that A and B are two sets with order relations <A and <B respectively. Deﬁne an order relation < on A × B by deﬁning
a1 × b1 < a2 × b2 if a1 <A a2, or if a1 = a2 and b1 <B b2. It is called the dictionary order relation on A × B.
Checking that this is an order relation involves looking at several separate cases; we leave it to you.
The reason for the choice of terminology is fairly evident. The rule deﬁning < is the same as the rule used to order the words in the dictionary. Given two words, one compares their ﬁrst letters and orders the words according to the order in which their ﬁrst letters appear in the alphabet. If the ﬁrst letters are the same, one compares their second letters and orders accordingly. And so on.
EXAMPLE 11. Consider the dictionary order on the plane R × R. In this order, the point p is less than every point lying above it on the vertical line through p, and p is less than every point to the right of this vertical line.
EXAMPLE 12. Consider the set [0, 1) of real numbers and the set Z+ of positive integers, both in their usual orders; give Z+ × [0, 1) the dictionary order. This set has the same order type as the set of nonnegative reals; the function
f (n × t) = n + t − 1 is the required bijective order-preserving correspondence. On the other hand, the set [0, 1) × Z+ in the dictionary order has quite a different order type; for example, every element of this ordered set has an immediate successor. These sets are pictured in Figure 3.3.

One of the properties of the real numbers that you may have seen before is the “least upper bound property.” One can deﬁne this property for an arbitrary ordered set. First, we need some preliminary deﬁnitions.
Suppose that A is a set ordered by the relation <. Let A0 be a subset of A. We say that the element b is the largest element of A0 if b ∈ A0 and if x ≤ b for every x ∈ A0. Similarly, we say that a is the smallest element of A0 if a ∈ A0 and if a ≤ x for every x ∈ A0. It is easy to see that a set has at most one largest element and at most one smallest element.
We say that the subset A0 of A is bounded above if there is an element b of A such that x ≤ b for every x ∈ A0; the element b is called an upper bound for A0. If the set of all upper bounds for A0 has a smallest element, that element is called the least upper bound, or the supremum, of A0. It is denoted by sup A0; it may or may not belong to A0. If it does, it is the largest element of A0.
Similarly, A0 is bounded below if there is an element a of A such that a ≤ x for every x ∈ A0; the element a is called a lower bound for A0. If the set of all lower bounds for A0 has a largest element, that element is called the greatest lower bound, or the inﬁmum, of A0. It is denoted by inf A0; it may or may not belong to A0. If it does, it is the smallest element of A0.
Now we can deﬁne the least upper bound property.
Deﬁnition. An ordered set A is said to have the least upper bound property if every nonempty subset A0 of A that is bounded above has a least upper bound. Analogously, the set A is said to have the greatest lower bound property if every nonempty subset A0 of A that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound.
We leave it to the exercises to show that A has the least upper bound property if and only if it has the greatest lower bound property.
EXAMPLE 13. Consider the set A = (−1, 1) of real numbers in the usual order. Assuming the fact that the real numbers have the least upper bound property, it follows that

25

28 Set Theory and Logic

Ch. 1

the set A has the least upper bound property. For, given any subset of A having an upper
bound in A, it follows that its least upper bound (in the real numbers) must be in A. For example, the subset {−1/2n | n ∈ Z+} of A, though it has no largest element, does have a least upper bound in A, the number 0.
On the other hand, the set B = (−1, 0) ∪ (0, 1) does not have the least upper bound property. The subset {−1/2n | n ∈ Z+} of B is bounded above by any element of (0, 1), but it has no least upper bound in B.

§4 The Integers and the Real Numbers
Up to now we have been discussing what might be called the logical foundations for our study of topology—the elementary concepts of set theory. Now we turn to what we might call the mathematical foundations for our study—the integers and the real number system. We have already used them in an informal way in the examples and exercises of the preceding sections. Now we wish to deal with them more formally.
One way of establishing these foundations is to construct the real number system, using only the axioms of set theory—to build them with one’s bare hands, so to speak. This way of approaching the subject takes a good deal of time and effort and is of greater logical than mathematical interest.
A second way is simply to assume a set of axioms for the real numbers and work from these axioms. In the present section, we shall sketch this approach to the real numbers. Speciﬁcally, we shall give a set of axioms for the real numbers and shall indicate how the familiar properties of real numbers and the integers are derived from them. But we shall leave most of the proofs to the exercises. If you have seen all this before, our description should refresh your memory. If not, you may want to work through the exercises in detail in order to make sure of your knowledge of the mathematical foundations.
First we need a deﬁnition from set theory.

Deﬁnition. A binary operation on a set A is a function f mapping A × A into A.
When dealing with a binary operation f on a set A, we usually use a notation different from the standard functional notation introduced in §2. Instead of denoting the value of the function f at the point (a, a ) by f (a, a ), we usually write the symbol for the function between the two coordinates of the point in question, writing the value of the function at (a, a ) as a f a . Furthermore (just as was the case with relations), it is more common to use some symbol other than a letter to denote an operation. Symbols often used are the plus symbol +, the multiplication symbols · and ◦, and the asterisk ∗; however, there are many others.

Assumption
We assume there exists a set R, called the set of real numbers, two binary operations + and · on R, called the addition and multiplication operations, respectively, and an order relation < on R, such that the following properties hold:
Algebraic Properties (1) (x + y) + z = x + (y + z), (x · y) · z = x · (y · z) for all x, y, z in R. (2) x + y = y + x, x · y = y · x for all x, y in R.

28

§4

The Integers and the Real Numbers

31

(3) There exists a unique element of R called zero, denoted by 0, such that x + 0 = x for all x ∈ R. There exists a unique element of R called one, different from 0 and denoted by 1, such that x · 1 = x for all x ∈ R.
(4) For each x in R, there exists a unique y in R such that x + y = 0. For each x in R different from 0, there exists a unique y in R such that x · y = 1.
(5) x · (y + z) = (x · y) + (x · z) for all x, y, z ∈ R.
A Mixed Algebraic and Order Property (6) If x > y, then x + z > y + z. If x > y and z > 0, then x · z > y · z.
Order Properties (7) The order relation < has the least upper bound property. (8) If x < y, there exists an element z such that x < z and z < y. From properties (1)–(5) follow the familiar “laws of algebra.” Given x, one de-
notes by −x that number y such that x + y = 0; it is called the negative of x. One deﬁnes the subtraction operation by the formula z − x = z + (−x). Similarly, given x = 0, one denotes by 1/x that number y such that x · y = 1; it is called the reciprocal of x. One deﬁnes the quotient z/x by the formula z/x = z · (1/x). The usual laws of signs, and the rules for adding and multiplying fractions, follow as theorems. These laws of algebra are listed in Exercise 1 at the end of the section. We often denote x · y simply by x y.
When one adjoins property (6) to properties (l)–(5), one can prove the usual “laws of inequalities,” such as the following:
If x > y and z < 0, then x · z < y · z.
−1 < 0 and 0 < 1.
The laws of inequalities are listed in Exercise 2. We deﬁne a number x to be positive if x > 0, and to be negative if x < 0. We
denote the positive reals by R+ and the nonnegative reals (for reasons to be explained later) by R¯ +. Properties (1)–(6) are familiar properties in modern algebra. Any set with two binary operations satisfying (1)–(5) is called by algebraists a ﬁeld; if the ﬁeld has an order relation satisfying (6), it is called an ordered ﬁeld.
Properties (7) and (8), on the other hand, are familiar properties in topology. They involve only the order relation; any set with an order relation satisfying (7) and (8) is called by topologists a linear continuum.
Now it happens that when one adjoins to the axioms for an ordered ﬁeld [properties (1)–(6)] the axioms for a linear continuum [properties (7) and (8)], the resulting list contains some redundancies. Property (8), in particular, can be proved as a consequence of the others; given x < y one can show that z = (x + y)/(1 + 1) satisﬁes the requirements of (8). Therefore, in the standard treatment of the real numbers, properties (1)–(7) are taken as axioms, and property (8) becomes a theorem. We have

included (8) in our list merely to emphasize the fact that it and the least upper bound property are the two crucial properties of the order relation for R. From these two properties many of the topological properties of R may be derived, as we shall see in Chapter 3.
Now there is nothing in this list as it stands to tell us what an integer is. We now deﬁne the integers, using only properties (1)–(6).
Deﬁnition. A subset A of the real numbers is said to be inductive if it contains the number 1, and if for every x in A, the number x +1 is also in A. Let A be the collection of all inductive subsets of R. Then the set Z+ of positive integers is deﬁned by the equation
Z+ = A.
A∈A
Note that the set R+ of positive real numbers is inductive, for it contains 1 and the statement x > 0 implies the statement x + 1 > 0. Therefore, Z+ ⊂ R+, so the elements of Z+ are indeed positive, as the choice of terminology suggests. Indeed, one sees readily that 1 is the smallest element of Z+, because the set of all real numbers x for which x ≥ 1 is inductive.
The basic properties of Z+, which follow readily from the deﬁnition, are the following:
(1) Z+ is inductive. (2) (Principle of induction). If A is an inductive set of positive integers, then A =
Z+. We deﬁne the set Z of integers to be the set consisting of the positive integers Z+, the number 0, and the negatives of the elements of Z+. One proves that the sum, difference, and product of two integers are integers, but the quotient is not necessarily an integer. The set Q of quotients of integers is called the set of rational numbers.
One proves also that, given the integer n, there is no integer a such that n < a < n + 1.
If n is a positive integer, we use the symbol Sn to denote the set of all positive integers less than n; we call it a section of the positive integers. The set S1 is empty, and Sn+1 denotes the set of positive integers between 1 and n, inclusive. We also use the notation
{1, . . . , n} = Sn+1
for the latter set. Now we prove two properties of the positive integers that may not be quite so
familiar, but are quite useful. They may be thought of as alternative versions of the induction principle.
Theorem 4.1 (Well-ordering property). Every nonempty subset of Z+ has a smallest element.

30

§4

The Integers and the Real Numbers

33

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that, for each n ∈ Z+, the following statement holds: Every nonempty subset of {1, . . . , n} has a smallest element.
Let A be the set of all positive integers n for which this statement holds. Then A contains 1, since if n = 1, the only nonempty subset of {1, . . . , n} is the set {1} itself. Then, supposing A contains n, we show that it contains n + 1. So let C be a nonempty subset of the set {1, . . . , n + 1}. If C consists of the single element n + 1, then that element is the smallest element of C. Otherwise, consider the set C ∩{1, . . . , n}, which is nonempty. Because n ∈ A, this set has a smallest element, which will automatically be the smallest element of C also. Thus A is inductive, so we conclude that A = Z+; hence the statement is true for all n ∈ Z+.
Now we prove the theorem. Suppose that D is a nonempty subset of Z+. Choose an element n of D. Then the set A = D ∩ {1, . . . , n} is nonempty, so that A has a
smallest element k. The element k is automatically the smallest element of D as well.

Theorem 4.2 (Strong induction principle). Let A be a set of positive integers. Suppose that for each positive integer n, the statement Sn ⊂ A implies the statement n ∈ A. Then A = Z+.
Proof. If A does not equal all of Z+, let n be the smallest positive integer that is not in A. Then every positive integer less than n is in A, so that Sn ⊂ A. Our hypothesis implies that n ∈ A, contrary to assumption.
Everything we have done up to now has used only the axioms for an ordered ﬁeld, properties (1)–(6) of the real numbers. At what point do you need (7), the least upper bound axiom?
For one thing, you need the least upper bound axiom to prove that the set Z+ of positive integers has no upper bound in R. This is the Archimedean ordering property of the real line. To prove it, we assume that Z+ has an upper bound and derive a contradiction. If Z+ has an upper bound, it has a least upper bound b. There exists n ∈ Z+ such that n > b − 1; for otherwise, b − 1 would be an upper bound for Z+ smaller than b. Then n + 1 > b, contrary to the fact that b is an upper bound for Z+.
The least upper bound axiom is also used to prove a number of other things about R. It is used for instance to show that R has the greatest lower bound√property. It is also used to prove the existence of a unique positive square root x for every positive real number. This fact, in turn, can be used to√demonstrate the existence of real numbers that are not rational numbers; the number 2 is an easy example.
We use the symbol 2 to denote 1 + 1, the symbol 3 to denote 2 + 1, and so on through the standard symbols for the positive integers. It is a fact that this procedure assigns to each positive integer a unique symbol, but we never need this fact and shall not prove it.
Proofs of these properties of the integers and real numbers, along with a few other properties we shall need later, are outlined in the exercises that follow.

§5 Cartesian Products
We have already deﬁned what we mean by the cartesian product A × B of two sets. Now we introduce more general cartesian products.
Deﬁnition. Let A be a nonempty collection of sets. An indexing function for A is a surjective function f from some set J , called the index set, to A. The collection A, together with the indexing function f , is called an indexed family of sets. Given α ∈ J , we shall denote the set f (α) by the symbol Aα. And we shall denote the indexed family itself by the symbol
{ Aα}α∈J ,
which is read “the family of all Aα, as α ranges over J .” Sometimes we write merely {Aα}, if it is clear what the index set is.
Note that although an indexing function is required to be surjective, it is not required to be injective. It is entirely possible for Aα and Aβ to be the same set of A, even though α = β.
One way in which indexing functions are used is to give a new notation for arbitrary unions and intersections of sets. Suppose that f : J → A is an indexing function for A; let Aα denote f (α). Then we deﬁne
Aα = {x | for at least one α ∈ J , x ∈ Aα},
α∈J
and
Aα = {x | for every α ∈ J , x ∈ Aα}.
α∈J

34

§5

Cartesian Products

37

These are simply new notations for previously deﬁned concepts; one sees at once (using the surjectivity of the index function) that the ﬁrst equals the union of all the elements of A and the second equals the intersection of all the elements of A.
Two especially useful index sets are the set {1, . . . , n} of positive integers from 1 to n, and the set Z+ of all positive integers. For these index sets, we introduce some special notation. If a collection of sets is indexed by the set {1, . . . , n}, we denote the indexed family by the symbol {A1, . . . , An}, and we denote the union and intersection, respectively, of the members of this family by the symbols
A1 ∪ · · · ∪ An and A1 ∩ · · · ∩ An.
In the case where the index set is the set Z+, we denote the indexed family by the symbol {A1, A2, . . . }, and the union and intersection by the respective symbols
A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · and A1 ∩ A2 ∩ · · · .
Deﬁnition. Let m be a positive integer. Given a set X , we deﬁne an m-tuple of elements of X to be a function
x : {1, . . . , m} → X.
If x is an m-tuple, we often denote the value of x at i by the symbol xi rather than x(i) and call it the ith coordinate of x. And we often denote the function x itself by the symbol
(x1, . . . , xm).
Now let {A1, . . . , Am} be a family of sets indexed with the set {1, . . . , m}. Let X = A1 ∪ · · · ∪ Am. We deﬁne the cartesian product of this indexed family, denoted by
m
Ai or A1 × · · · × Am,
i =1
to be the set of all m-tuples (x1, . . . , xm) of elements of X such that xi ∈ Ai for each i.
EXAMPLE 1. We now have two deﬁnitions for the symbol A × B. One deﬁnition is, of course, the one given earlier, under which A × B denotes the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ B. The second deﬁnition, just given, deﬁnes A × B as the set of all functions x : {1, 2} → A ∪ B such that x(1) ∈ A and x(2) ∈ B. There is an obvious bijective correspondence between these two sets, under which the ordered pair (a, b) corresponds to the function x deﬁned by x(1) = a and x(2) = b. Since we commonly denote this function x in “tuple notation” by the symbol (a, b), the notation itself suggests the correspondence. Thus for the cartesian product of two sets, the general deﬁnition of cartesian product reduces essentially to the earlier one.
EXAMPLE 2. How does the cartesian product A×B×C differ from the cartesian products A × (B × C) and (A × B) × C? Very little. There are obvious bijective correspondences between these sets, indicated as follows:
(a, b, c) ←→ (a, (b, c)) ←→ ((a, b), c).

Ch. 1

Deﬁnition. Given a set X , we deﬁne an ω-tuple of elements of X to be a function
x : Z+ −→ X ;
we also call such a function a sequence, or an inﬁnite sequence, of elements of X . If x is an ω-tuple, we often denote the value of x at i by xi rather than x(i), and call it the ith coordinate of x. We denote x itself by the symbol
(x1, x2, . . . ) or (xn)n∈Z+ .
Now let {A1, A2, . . . } be a family of sets, indexed with the positive integers; let X be the union of the sets in this family. The cartesian product of this indexed family of sets, denoted by
Ai or A1 × A2 × · · · ,
i ∈Z+
is deﬁned to be the set of all ω-tuples (x1, x2, . . . ) of elements of X such that xi ∈ Ai for each i.
Nothing in these deﬁnitions requires the sets Ai to be different from one another. Indeed, they may all equal the same set X . In that case, the cartesian product A1 × · · · × Am is just the set of all m-tuples of elements of X , which we denote by X m. Similarly, the product A1 × A2 × · · · is just the set of all ω-tuples of elements of X , which we denote by X ω.
Later we will deﬁne the cartesian product of an arbitrary indexed family of sets.
EXAMPLE 3. If R is the set of real numbers, then Rm denotes the set of all m-tuples of real numbers; it is often called euclidean m-space (although Euclid would never recognize it). Analogously, Rω is sometimes called “inﬁnite-dimensional euclidean space”; it is the set of all ω-tuples (x1, x2, . . . ) of real numbers, that is, the set of all functions x : Z+ → R.

We shall ignore this technicality when dealing with cartesian products).

§6 Finite Sets
Finite sets and inﬁnite sets, countable sets and uncountable sets, these are types of sets that you may have encountered before. Nevertheless, we shall discuss them in this section and the next, not only to make sure you understand them thoroughly, but also to elucidate some particular points of logic that will arise later on. First we consider ﬁnite sets.
Recall that if n is a positive integer, we use Sn to denote the set of positive integers less than n; it is called a section of the positive integers. The sets Sn are the prototypes for what we call the ﬁnite sets.
Deﬁnition. A set is said to be ﬁnite if there is a bijective correspondence of A with some section of the positive integers. That is, A is ﬁnite if it is empty or if there is a bijection
f : A −→ {1, . . . , n}
for some positive integer n. In the former case, we say that A has cardinality 0; in the latter case, we say that A has cardinality n.
For instance, the set {1, . . . , n} itself has cardinality n, for it is in bijective correspondence with itself under the identity function.

Ch. 1

Now note carefully: We have not yet shown that the cardinality of a ﬁnite set is uniquely determined by the set. It is of course clear that the empty set must have cardinality zero. But as far as we know, there might exist bijective correspondences of a given nonempty set A with two different sets {1, . . . , n} and {1, . . . , m}. The possibility may seem ridiculous, for it is like saying that it is possible for two people to count the marbles in a box and come out with two different answers, both correct. Our experience with counting in everyday life suggests that such is impossible, and in fact this is easy to prove when n is a small number such as 1, 2, or 3. But a direct proof when n is 5 million would be impossibly demanding.
Even empirical demonstration would be difﬁcult for such a large value of n. One might, for instance, construct an experiment by taking a freight car full of marbles and hiring 10 different people to count them independently. If one thinks of the physical problems involved, it seems likely that the counters would not all arrive at the same answer. Of course, the conclusion one could draw is that at least one person made a mistake. But that would mean assuming the correctness of the result one was trying to demonstrate empirically. An alternative explanation could be that there do exist bijective correspondences between the given set of marbles and two different sections of the positive integers.
In real life, we accept the ﬁrst explanation. We simply take it on faith that our experience in counting comparatively small sets of objects demonstrates a truth that holds for arbitrarily large sets as well.
However, in mathematics (as opposed to real life), one does not have to take this statement on faith. If it is formulated in terms of the existence of bijective correspondences rather than in terms of the physical act of counting, it is capable of mathematical proof. We shall prove shortly that if n = m, there do not exist bijective functions mapping a given set A onto both the sets {1, . . . , n} and {1, . . . , m}.
There are a number of other “intuitively obvious” facts about ﬁnite sets that are capable of mathematical proof; we shall prove some of them in this section and leave the rest to the exercises. Here is an easy fact to start with:
Lemma 6.1. Let n be a positive integer. Let A be a set; let a0 be an element of A. Then there exists a bijective correspondence f of the set A with the set {1, . . . , n + 1} if and only if there exists a bijective correspondence g of the set A − {a0} with the set {1, . . . , n}.
Proof. There are two implications to be proved. Let us ﬁrst assume that there is a bijective correspondence
g : A − {a0} −→ {1, . . . , n}.
We then deﬁne a function f : A −→ {1, . . . , n + 1} by setting
f (x) = g(x) for x ∈ A − {a0}, f (a0) = n + 1.
One checks at once that f is bijective.

To prove the converse, assume there is a bijective correspondence
f : A −→ {1, . . . , n + 1}.
If f maps a0 to the number n + 1, things are especially easy; in that case, the restriction f |A − {a0} is the desired bijective correspondence of A − {a0} with {1, . . . , n}. Otherwise, let f (a0) = m, and let a1 be the point of A such that f (a1) = n + 1. Then a1 = a0. Deﬁne a new function
h : A −→ {1, . . . , n + 1}
by setting
h(a0) = n + 1, h(a1) = m, h(x) = f (x) for x ∈ A − {a0} − {a1}.
See Figure 6.1. It is easy to check that h is a bijection. Now we are back in the easy case; the restriction h|A−{a0} is the desired bijection
of A − {a0} with {1, . . . , n}.

From this lemma a number of useful consequences follow:
Theorem 6.2. Let A be a set; suppose that there exists a bijection f : A → {1, . . . , n} for some n ∈ Z+. Let B be a proper subset of A. Then there exists no bijection g : B → {1, . . . , n}; but (provided B = ∅) there does exist a bijection h : B → {1, . . . , m} for some m < n.
Proof. The case in which B = ∅ is trivial, for there cannot exist a bijection of the empty set B with the nonempty set {1, . . . , n}.
We prove the theorem “by induction.” Let C be the subset of Z+ consisting of those integers n for which the theorem holds. We shall show that C is inductive. From this we conclude that C = Z+, so the theorem is true for all positive integers n.
First we show the theorem is true for n = 1. In this case A consists of a single element {a}, and its only proper subset B is the empty set.

Ch. 1

Now assume that the theorem is true for n; we prove it true for n + 1. Suppose that f : A → {1, . . . , n + 1} is a bijection, and B is a nonempty proper subset of A. Choose an element a0 of B and an element a1 of A − B. We apply the preceding lemma to conclude there is a bijection
g : A − {a0} −→ {1, . . . , n}.
Now B − {a0} is a proper subset of A − {a0}, for a1 belongs to A − {a0} and not to B −{a0}. Because the theorem has been assumed to hold for the integer n, we conclude the following: (1) There exists no bijection h : B − {a0} → {1, . . . , n}. (2) Either B − {a0} = ∅, or there exists a bijection
k : B − {a0} −→ {1, . . . , p} for some p < n.
The preceding lemma, combined with (1), implies that there is no bijection of B with {1, . . . , n + 1}. This is the ﬁrst half of what we wanted to proved. To prove the second half, note that if B − {a0} = ∅, there is a bijection of B with the set {1}; while if B − {a0} = ∅, we can apply the preceding lemma, along with (2), to conclude that there is a bijection of B with {1, . . . , p + 1}. In either case, there is a bijection of B with {1, . . . , m} for some m < n + 1, as desired. The induction principle now shows that the theorem is true for all n ∈ Z+.

Corollary 6.3. If A is ﬁnite, there is no bijection of A with a proper subset of itself.
Proof. Assume that B is a proper subset of A and that f : A → B is a bijection. By assumption, there is a bijection g : A → {1, . . . , n} for some n. The composite g◦ f −1 is then a bijection of B with {1, . . . , n}. This contradicts the preceding theorem.

Corollary 6.4. Z+ is not ﬁnite.
Proof. The function f : Z+ → Z+ − {1} deﬁned by f (n) = n + 1 is a bijection of Z+ with a proper subset of itself.

Corollary 6.5. The cardinality of a ﬁnite set A is uniquely determined by A. Proof. Let m < n. Suppose there are bijections

f : A −→ {1, . . . , n}, g : A −→ {1, . . . , m}.

Then the composite

g ◦ f −1 : {1, . . . , n} −→ {1, . . . , m}

is a bijection of the ﬁnite set {1, . . . , n} with a proper subset of itself, contradicting the corollary just proved.

Corollary 6.6. If B is a subset of the ﬁnite set A, then B is ﬁnite. If B is a proper subset of A, then the cardinality of B is less than the cardinality of A.

Corollary 6.7. Let B be a nonempty set. Then the following are equivalent: (1) B is ﬁnite. (2) There is a surjective function from a section of the positive integers onto B. (3) There is an injective function from B into a section of the positive integers.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Since B is nonempty, there is, for some n, a bijective function f : {1, . . . , n} → B.
(2) ⇒ (3). If f : {1, . . . , n} → B is surjective, deﬁne g : B → {1, . . . , n} by the equation
g(b) = smallest element of f −1({b}).
Because f is surjective, the set f −1{(b)} is nonempty; then the well-ordering property of Z+ tells us that g(b) is uniquely deﬁned. The map g is injective, for if b = b , then the sets f −1({b}) and f −1({b }) are disjoint, so their smallest elements must be different.
(3) ⇒ (1). If g : B → {1, . . . , n} is injective, then changing the range of g gives a bijection of B with a subset of {1, . . . , n}. It follows from the preceding corollary that B is ﬁnite.
Corollary 6.8. Finite unions and ﬁnite cartesian products of ﬁnite sets are ﬁnite.
Proof. We ﬁrst show that if A and B are ﬁnite, so is A ∪ B. The result is trivial if A or B is empty. Otherwise, there are bijections f : {1, . . . , m} → A and g : {1, . . . , n} → B for some choice of m and n. Deﬁne a function h : {1, . . . , m + n} → A ∪ B by setting h(i) = f (i) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m and h(i) = g(i − m) for i = m + 1, . . . , m + n. It is easy to check that h is surjective, from which it follows that A ∪ B is ﬁnite.
Now we show by induction that ﬁniteness of the sets A1, . . . , An implies ﬁniteness of their union. This result is trivial for n = 1. Assuming it true for n − 1, we note that A1 ∪ · · · ∪ An is the union of the two ﬁnite sets A1 ∪ · · · ∪ An−1 and An, so the result of the preceding paragraph applies.
Now we show that the cartesian product of two ﬁnite sets A and B is ﬁnite. Given a ∈ A, the set {a} × B is ﬁnite, being in bijective correspondence with B. The set A × B is the union of these sets; since there are only ﬁnitely many of them, A × B is a ﬁnite union of ﬁnite sets and thus ﬁnite.
To prove that the product A1 × · · · × An is ﬁnite if each Ai is ﬁnite, one proceeds by induction.

§7 Countable and Uncountable Sets
Just as sections of the positive integers are the prototypes for the ﬁnite sets, the set of all the positive integers is the prototype for what we call the countably inﬁnite sets. In this section, we shall study such sets; we shall also construct some sets that are neither ﬁnite nor countably inﬁnite. This study will lead us into a discussion of what we mean by the process of “inductive deﬁnition.”

Deﬁnition. A set A is said to be inﬁnite if it is not ﬁnite. It is said to be countably inﬁnite if there is a bijective correspondence

f : A −→ Z+.
EXAMPLE 1. The set Z of all integers is countably inﬁnite. One checks easily that the function f : Z → Z+ deﬁned by

f (n) = 2n

if n > 0,

−2n + 1 if n ≤ 0

is a bijection.

EXAMPLE 2. The product Z+ × Z+ is countably inﬁnite. If we represent the elements of the product Z+ × Z+ by the integer points in the ﬁrst quadrant, then the left-hand portion of Figure 7.1 suggests how to “count” the points, that is, how to put them in bijective correspondence with the positive integers. A picture is not a proof, of course, but this picture suggests a proof. First, we deﬁne a bijection f : Z+ × Z+ → A, where A is the subset of Z+ × Z+ consisting of pairs (x, y) for which y ≤ x, by the equation
f (x, y) = (x + y − 1, y).
Then we construct a bijection of A with the positive integers, deﬁning g : A → Z+ by the formula
g(x, y) = 1 (x − 1)x + y. 2
We leave it to you to show that f and g are bijections. Another proof that Z+ × Z+ is countably inﬁnite will be given later.

Deﬁnition. A set is said to be countable if it is either ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite. A set that is not countable is said to be uncountable.
There is a very useful criterion for showing that a set is countable. It is the following:
Theorem 7.1. Let B be a nonempty set. Then the following are equivalent: (1) B is countable. (2) There is a surjective function f : Z+ → B. (3) There is an injective function g : B → Z+.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Suppose that B is countable. If B is countably inﬁnite, there is a bijection f : Z+ → B by deﬁnition, and we are through. If B is ﬁnite, there is a

Ch. 1

bijection h : {1, . . . , n} → B for some n ≥ 1. (Recall that B = ∅.) We can extend h to a surjection f : Z+ → B by deﬁning
f (i) = h(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, h(1) for i > n.
(2) ⇒ (3). Let f : Z+ → B be a surjection. Deﬁne g : B → Z+ by the equation
g(b) = smallest element of f −1({b}).
Because f is surjective, f −1({b}) is nonempty; thus g is well deﬁned. The map g is injective, for if b = b , the sets f −1({b}) and f −1({b }) are disjoint, so their smallest elements are different.
(3) ⇒ (1). Let g : B → Z+ be an injection; we wish to prove B is countable. By changing the range of g, we can obtain a bijection of B with a subset of Z+. Thus to prove our result, it sufﬁces to show that every subset of Z+ is countable. So let C be a subset of Z+.
If C is ﬁnite, it is countable by deﬁnition. So what we need to prove is that every inﬁnite subset C of Z+ is countably inﬁnite. This statement is certainly plausible. For the elements of C can easily be arranged in an inﬁnite sequence; one simply takes the set Z+ in its usual order and “erases” all the elements of Z+ that are not in C!
The plausibility of this argument may make one overlook its informality. Providing a formal proof requires a certain amount of care. We state this result as a separate lemma, which follows.
Lemma 7.2. If C is an inﬁnite subset of Z+, then C is countably inﬁnite.
Proof. We deﬁne a bijection h : Z+ → C. We proceed by induction. Deﬁne h(1) to be the smallest element of C; it exists because every nonempty subset C of Z+ has a smallest element. Then assuming that h(1), . . . , h(n − 1) are deﬁned, deﬁne
h(n) = smallest element of [C − h({1, . . . , n − 1})].
The set C − h({1, . . . , n − 1}) is not empty; for if it were empty, then h : {1, . . . , n − 1} → C would be surjective, so that C would be ﬁnite (by Corollary 6.7). Thus h(n) is well deﬁned. By induction, we have deﬁned h(n) for all n ∈ Z+.
To show that h is injective is easy. Given m < n, note that h(m) belongs to the set h({1, . . . , n − 1}), whereas h(n), by deﬁnition, does not. Hence h(n) = h(m).
To show that h is surjective, let c be any element of C; we show that c lies in the image set of h. First note that h(Z+) cannot be contained in the ﬁnite set {1, . . . , c}, because h(Z+) is inﬁnite (since h is injective). Therefore, there is an n in Z+, such that h(n) > c. Let m be the smallest element of Z+, such that h(m) ≥ c. Then for all i < m, we must have h(i) < c. Thus, c does not belong to the set h({1, . . . , m − 1}). Since h(m) is deﬁned as the smallest element of the set C − h({1, . . . , m − 1}), we must have h(m) ≤ c. Putting the two inequalities together, we have h(m) = c, as desired.

There is a point in the preceding proof where we stretched the principles of logic a bit. It occurred at the point where we said that “using the induction principle” we had deﬁned the function h for all positive integers n. You may have seen arguments like this used before, with no questions raised concerning their legitimacy. We have already used such an argument ourselves, in the exercises of §4, when we deﬁned an.
But there is a problem here. After all, the induction principle states only that if A is an inductive set of positive integers, then A = Z+. To use the principle to prove a theorem “by induction,” one begins the proof with the statement “Let A be the set of all positive integers n for which the theorem is true,” and then one goes ahead to prove that A is inductive, so that A must be all of Z+.
In the preceding theorem, however, we were not really proving a theorem by induction, but deﬁning something by induction. How then should we start the proof? Can we start by saying, “Let A be the set of all integers n for which the function h is deﬁned”? But that’s silly; the symbol h has no meaning at the outset of the proof. It only takes on meaning in the course of the proof. So something more is needed.
What is needed is another principle, which we call the principle of recursive deﬁnition. In the proof of the preceding theorem, we wished to assert the following:
Given the inﬁnite subset C of Z+, there is a unique function h : Z+ → C satisfying the formula:

h(1) = smallest element of C,

(∗)

h(i) = smallest element of [C − h({1, . . . , i − 1})] for all i > 1.

The formula (∗) is called a recursion formula for h; it deﬁnes the function h in terms of itself. A deﬁnition given by such a formula is called a recursive deﬁnition.
Now one can get into logical difﬁculties when one tries to deﬁne something recursively. Not all recursive formulas make sense. The recursive formula
h(i) = smallest element of [C − h({1, . . . , i + 1})],
for example, is self-contradictory; although h(i) necessarily is an element of the set h({1, . . . , i + 1}), this formula says that it does not belong to the set. Another example is the classic paradox:
Let the barber of Seville shave every man of Seville who does not shave himself. Who shall shave the barber?
In this statement, the barber appears twice, once in the phrase “the barber of Seville” and once as an element of the set “men of Seville”; this deﬁnition of whom the barber shall shave is a recursive one. It also happens to be self-contradictory.
Some recursive formulas do make sense, however. Speciﬁcally, one has the following principle:

Principle of recursive deﬁnition. Let A be a set. Given a formula that deﬁnes h(1) as a unique element of A, and for i > 1 deﬁnes h(i) uniquely as an element of A in terms of the values of h for positive integers less than i, this formula determines a unique function h : Z+ → A.

This principle is the one we actually used in the proof of Lemma 7.2. You can simply accept it on faith if you like. It may however be proved rigorously, using the principle of induction. We shall formulate it more precisely in the next section and indicate how it is proved. Mathematicians seldom refer to this principle speciﬁcally. They are much more likely to write a proof like our proof of Lemma 7.2 above, a proof in which they invoke the “induction principle” to deﬁne a function when what they are really using is the principle of recursive deﬁnition. We shall avoid undue pedantry in this book by following their example.
Corollary 7.3. A subset of a countable set is countable.
Proof. Suppose A ⊂ B, where B is countable. There is an injection f of B into Z+; the restriction of f to A is an injection of A into Z+.
Corollary 7.4. The set Z+ × Z+ is countably inﬁnite.
Proof. In view of Theorem 7.1, it sufﬁces to construct an injective map f : Z+ × Z+ → Z+. We deﬁne f by the equation
f (n, m) = 2n3m.
It is easy to check that f is injective. For suppose that 2n3m = 2p3q . If n < p, then 3m = 2p−n3q , contradicting the fact that 3m is odd for all m. Therefore, n = p. As a result, 3m = 3q , Then if m < q, it follows that 1 = 3q−m, another contradiction. Hence m = q.
EXAMPLE 3. The set Q+ of positive rational numbers is countably inﬁnite. For we can deﬁne a surjection g : Z+ × Z+ → Q+ by the equation
g(n, m) = m/n.
Because Z+ × Z+ is countable, there is a surjection f : Z+ → Z+ × Z+. Then the composite g ◦ f : Z+ → Q+ is a surjection, so that Q+ is countable. And, of course, Q+ is inﬁnite because it contains Z+.
We leave it as an exercise to show the set Q of all rational numbers is countably inﬁnite.

Theorem 7.5. A countable union of countable sets is countable.
Proof. Let { An}n∈J be an indexed family of countable sets, where the index set J is either {1, . . . , N } or Z+. Assume that each set An is nonempty, for convenience; this assumption does not change anything.
Because each An is countable, we can choose, for each n, a surjective function fn : Z+ → An. Similarly, we can choose a surjective function g : Z+ → J . Now deﬁne
h : Z+ × Z+ → An

by the equation
h(k, m) = fg(k)(m).
It is easy to check that h is surjective. Since Z+ × Z+ is in bijective correspondence with Z+, the countability of the union follows from Theorem 7.1.

Theorem 7.6. A ﬁnite product of countable sets is countable.
Proof. First let us show that the product of two countable sets A and B is countable. The result is trivial if A or B is empty. Otherwise, choose surjective functions f : Z+ → A and g : Z+ → B. Then the function h : Z+ × Z+ → A × B deﬁned by the equation h(n, m) = ( f (n), g(m)) is surjective, so that A × B is countable.
In general, we proceed by induction. Assuming that A1 × · · · × An−1 is countable if each Ai is countable, we prove the same thing for the product A1 × · · · × An. First, note that there is a bijective correspondence
g : A1 × · · · × An −→ ( A1 × · · · × An−1) × An
deﬁned by the equation
g(x1, . . . , xn) = ((x1, . . . , xn−1), xn).
Because the set A1 × · · · × An−1 is countable by the induction assumption and An is countable by hypothesis, the product of these two sets is countable, as proved in the preceding paragraph. We conclude that A1 × · · · × An is countable as well.

It is very tempting to assert that countable products of countable sets should be countable; but this assertion is in fact not true:

Theorem 7.7. Let X denote the two element set {0, 1}. Then the set X ω is uncountable. Proof. We show that, given any function
g : Z+ −→ X ω,
g is not surjective. For this purpose, let us denote g(n) as follows :

g(n) = (xn1, xn2, xn3, . . . xnm, . . . ), where each xi j is either 0 or 1. Then we deﬁne an element y = (y1, y2, . . . , yn, . . . ) of X ω by letting

yn =

0 1

if xnn = 1, if xnn = 0.

Ch. 1

(If we write the numbers xni in a rectangular array, the particular elements xnn appear as the diagonal entries in this array; we choose y so that its nth coordinate differs from the diagonal entry xnn.)
Now y is an element of X ω, and y does not lie in the image of g; given n, the point g(n) and the point y differ in at least one coordinate, namely, the nth. Thus, g is not surjective.
The cartesian product {0, 1}ω is one example of an uncountable set. Another is the set P (Z+), as the following theorem implies:
Theorem 7.8. Let A be a set. There is no injective map f : P (A) → A, and there is no surjective map g : A → P (A).
Proof. In general, if B is a nonempty set, the existence of an injective map f : B → C implies the existence of a surjective map g : C → B; one deﬁnes g(c) = f −1(c) for each c in the image set of f , and deﬁnes g arbitrarily on the rest of C.
Therefore, it sufﬁces to prove that given a map g : A → P (A), the map g is not surjective. For each a ∈ A, the image g(a) of a is a subset of A, which may or may not contain the point a itself. Let B be the subset of A consisting of all those points a such that g(a) does not contain a;
B = {a | a ∈ A − g(a)}.
Now, B may be empty, or it may be all of A, but that does not matter. We assert that B is a subset of A that does not lie in the image of g. For suppose that B = g(a0) for some a0 ∈ A. We ask the question: Does a0 belong to B or not? By deﬁnition of B,
a0 ∈ B ⇐⇒ a0 ∈ A − g(a0) ⇐⇒ a0 ∈ A − B.
In either case, we have a contradiction.
Now we have proved the existence of uncountable sets. But we have not yet mentioned the most familiar uncountable set of all—the set of real numbers. You have probably seen the uncountability of R demonstrated already. If one assumes that every real number can be represented uniquely by an inﬁnite decimal (with the proviso that a representation ending in an inﬁnite string of 9’s is forbidden), then the uncountability of the reals can be proved by a variant of the diagonal procedure used in the proof of Theorem 7.7. But this proof is in some ways not very satisfying. One reason is that the inﬁnite decimal representation of a real number is not at all an elementary consequence of the axioms but requires a good deal of labor to prove. Another reason is that the uncountability of R does not, in fact, depend on the inﬁnite decimal expansion of R or indeed on any of the algebraic properties of R; it depends on only the order properties of R. We shall demonstrate the uncountability of R, using only its order properties, in a later chapter.

∗§8 The Principle of Recursive Deﬁnition

Before considering the general form of the principle of recursive deﬁnition, let us ﬁrst
prove it in a speciﬁc case, that of Lemma 7.2. That should make the underlying idea
of the proof much clearer when we consider the general case. So, given the inﬁnite subset C of Z+, let us consider the following recursion for-
mula for a function h : Z+ → C:

h(1) = smallest element of C,

(∗)

h(i) = smallest element of [C − h({1, . . . , i − 1})] for i > 1.

We shall prove that there exists a unique function h : Z+ → C satisfying this recursion formula.
The ﬁrst step is to prove that there exist functions deﬁned on sections {1, . . . , n} of Z+ that satisfy (∗):

Lemma 8.1. Given n ∈ Z+, there exists a function f : {1, . . . , n} → C
that satisﬁes (∗) for all i in its domain.

50

§8

The Principle of Recursive Deﬁnition

53

Proof. The point of this lemma is that it is a statement that depends on n; therefore, it is capable of being proved by induction. Let A be the set of all n for which the lemma holds. We show that A is inductive. It then follows that A = Z+.
The lemma is true for n = 1, since the function f : {1} → C deﬁned by the equation
f (1) = smallest element of C
satisﬁes (∗). Supposing the lemma to be true for n − 1, we prove it true for n. By hypothesis,
there is a function f : {1, . . . , n − 1} → C satisfying (∗) for all i in its domain. Deﬁne f : {1, . . . , n} → C by the equations
f (i) = f (i) for i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, f (n) = smallest element of [C − f ({1, . . . , n − 1})].
Since C is inﬁnite, f is not surjective; hence the set C − f ({1, . . . , n − 1}) is not empty, and f (n) is well deﬁned. Note that this deﬁnition is an acceptable one; it does not deﬁne f in terms of itself but in terms of the given function f .
It is easy to check that f satisﬁes (∗) for all i in its domain. The function f satisﬁes (∗) for i ≤ n − 1 because it equals f there. And f satisﬁes (∗) for i = n because, by deﬁnition,
f (n) = smallest element of [C − f ({1, . . . , n − 1})]
and f ({1, . . . , n − 1}) = f ({1, . . . , n − 1}).

Lemma 8.2. Suppose that f : {1, . . . , n} → C and g : {1, . . . , m} → C both satisfy (∗) for all i in their respective domains. Then f (i) = g(i) for all i in both domains.
Proof. Suppose not. Let i be the smallest integer for which f (i) = g(i). The integer i is not 1, because
f (1) = smallest element of C = g(1),
by (∗). Now for all j < i, we have f ( j) = g( j). Because f and g satisfy (∗),
f (i) = smallest element of [C − f ({1, . . . , i − 1})], g(i) = smallest element of [C − g({1, . . . , i − 1})].
Since f ({1, . . . , i − 1}) = g({1, . . . , i − 1}), we have f (i) = g(i), contrary to the choice of i.

Ch. 1

Theorem 8.3. There exists a unique function h : Z+ → C satisfying (∗) for all i ∈ Z+.
Proof. By Lemma 8.1, there exists for each n a function that maps {1, . . . , n} into C and satisﬁes (∗) for all i in its domain. Given n, Lemma 8.2 shows that this function is unique; two such functions having the same domain must be equal. Let fn : {1, . . . , n} → C denote this unique function.
Now comes the crucial step. We deﬁne a function h : Z+ → C by deﬁning its rule to be the union U of the rules of the functions fn. The rule for fn is a subset of {1, . . . , n} × C; therefore, U is a subset of Z+ × C. We must show that U is the rule for a function h : Z+ → C.
That is, we must show that each element i of Z+ appears as the ﬁrst coordinate of exactly one element of U . This is easy. The integer i lies in the domain of fn if and only if n > i. Therefore, the set of elements of U of which i is the ﬁrst coordinate is precisely the set of all pairs of the form (i, fn(i)), for n ≥ i. Now Lemma 8.2 tells us that fn(i) = fm(i) if n, m ≥ i. Therefore, all these elements of U are equal; that is, there is only one element of U that has i as its ﬁrst coordinate.
To show that h satisﬁes (∗) is also easy; it is a consequence of the following facts:
h(i) = fn(i) for i ≤ n,
fn satisﬁes (∗) for all i in its domain.
The proof of uniqueness is a copy of the proof of Lemma 8.2.

Now we formulate the general principle of recursive deﬁnition. There are no new ideas involved in its proof, so we leave it as an exercise.

Theorem 8.4 (Principle of recursive deﬁnition). Let A be a set; let a0 be an element of A. Suppose ρ is a function that assigns, to each function f mapping a nonempty section of the positive integers into A, an element of A. Then there exists a
unique function

h : Z+ → A

such that (∗)

h(1) = a0, h(i) = ρ(h|{1, . . . , i − 1}) for i > 1.

The formula (∗) is called a recursion formula for h. It speciﬁes h(1), and it expresses the value of h at i > 1 in terms of the values of h for positive integers less than i.
EXAMPLE 1. Let us show that Theorem 8.3 is a special case of this theorem. Given the inﬁnite subset C of Z+, let a0 be the smallest element of C, and deﬁne ρ by the equation
ρ( f ) = smallest element of [C − (image set of f )].

52

§8

The Principle of Recursive Deﬁnition

55

Because C is inﬁnite and f is a function mapping a ﬁnite set into C, the image set of f is not all of C; therefore, ρ is well deﬁned. By Theorem 8.4 there exists a function h : Z+ → C such that h(1) = a0, and for i > 1,
h(i) = ρ(h|{1, . . . , i − 1}) = smallest element of [C − (image set of h|{1, . . . , i − 1})] = smallest element of [C − h({1 . . . , i − 1})],

as desired.

EXAMPLE 2. formula

Given a ∈ R, we “deﬁned” an, in the exercises of §4, by the recursion
a1 = a, an = an−1 · a.

We wish to apply Theorem 8.4 to deﬁne a function h : Z+ → R rigorously such that h(n) = an. To apply this theorem, let a0 denote the element a of R, and deﬁne ρ by the equation ρ( f ) = f (m)·a, where f : {1, . . . , m} → R. Then there exists a unique function h : Z+ → R such that
h(1) = a0, h(i) = ρ(h|{1, . . . , i − 1}) for i > 1.

This means that h(1) = a, and h(i) = h(i − 1) · a for i > 1. If we denote h(i) by ai , we have
a1 = a, ai = ai−1 · a,

as desired.

§9 Inﬁnite Sets and the Axiom of Choice
We have already obtained several criteria for a set to be inﬁnite. We know, for instance, that a set A is inﬁnite if it has a countably inﬁnite subset, or if there is a bijection of A with a proper subset of itself. It turns out that either of these properties is sufﬁcient to characterize inﬁnite sets. This we shall now prove. The proof will lead us into a discussion of a point of logic we have not yet mentioned—the axiom of choice.

Theorem 9.1. Let A be a set. The following statements about A are equivalent: (1) There exists an injective function f : Z+ → A. (2) There exists a bijection of A with a proper subset of itself.
(3) A is inﬁnite.
Proof. We prove the implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (1). To prove that (1) ⇒ (2), we assume there is an injective function f : Z+ → A. Let the image set f (Z+) be denoted by B; and let f (n) be denoted by an. Because f is injective, an = am if n = m. Deﬁne

g : A −→ A − {a1}

by the equations

g(an) = an+1 for an ∈ B,

g(x) = x

for x ∈ A − B.

The map g is indicated schematically in Figure 9.1; one checks easily that it is a bijection.

The implication (2) ⇒ (3) is just the contrapositive of Corollary 6.3, so it has already been proved. To prove that (3) ⇒ (1), we assume that A is inﬁnite and construct “by induction” an injective function f : Z+ → A.
First, since the set A is not empty, we can choose a point a1 of A; deﬁne f (1) to be the point so chosen.
Then, assuming that we have deﬁned f (1), . . . , f (n − 1), we wish to deﬁne f (n). The set A− f ({1, . . . , n−1}) is not empty; for if it were empty, the map f : {1, . . . , n− 1} → A would be a surjection and A would be ﬁnite. Hence, we can choose an

55

58 Set Theory and Logic

Ch. 1

element of the set A − f ({1, . . . , n − 1}) and deﬁne f (n) to be this element. “Using the induction principle”, we have deﬁned f for all n ∈ Z+.
It is easy to see that f is injective. For suppose that m < n. Then f (m) belongs to the set f ({1, . . . , n − 1}), whereas f (n), by deﬁnition, does not. Therefore, f (n) = f (m).

Let us try to reformulate this “induction” proof more carefully, so as to make
explicit our use of the principle of recursive deﬁnition. Given the inﬁnite set A, we attempt to deﬁne f : Z+ → A recursively by the
formula

(∗)

f (1) = a1,

f (i) = an arbitrary element of [A − f ({1, . . . , i − 1})] for i > 1.

But this is not an acceptable recursion formula at all! For it does not deﬁne f (i) uniquely in terms of f |{1, . . . , i − 1}.
In this respect this formula differs notably from the recursion formula we considered in proving Lemma 7.2. There we had an inﬁnite subset C of Z+, and we deﬁned h by the formula

h(1) = smallest element of C, h(i) = smallest element of [C − h({1, . . . , i − 1})] for i > 1.

This formula does deﬁne h(i) uniquely in terms of h|{1, . . . , i − 1}. Another way of seeing that (∗) is not an acceptable recursion formula is to note
that if it were, the principle of recursive deﬁnition would imply that there is a unique function f : Z+ → A satisfying (∗). But by no stretch of the imagination does (∗) specify f uniquely. In fact, this “deﬁnition” of f involves inﬁnitely many arbitrary choices.
What we are saying is that the proof we have given for Theorem 9.1 is not actually a proof. Indeed, on the basis of the properties of set theory we have discussed up to now, it is not possible to prove this theorem. Something more is needed.
Previously, we described certain deﬁnite allowable methods for specifying sets:
(1) Deﬁning a set by listing its elements, or by taking a given set A and specifying a subset B of it by giving a property that the elements of B are to satisfy.
(2) Taking unions or intersections of the elements of a given collection of sets, or taking the difference of two sets.
(3) Taking the set of all subsets of a given set.
(4) Taking cartesian products of sets. Now the rule for the function f is really a set: a subset of Z+ × A. Therefore, to prove the existence of the function f , we must construct the appropriate subset of Z+ × A, using the allowed methods for forming sets. The methods already given simply are not adequate for this purpose. We need a new way of asserting the existence of a set. So, we add to the list of allowed methods of forming sets the following:

56

§9

Inﬁnite Sets and the Axiom of Choice

59

Axiom of choice. Given a collection A of disjoint nonempty sets, there exists a set C consisting of exactly one element from each element of A; that is, a set C such that C is contained in the union of the elements of A, and for each A ∈ A, the set C ∩ A contains a single element.
The set C can be thought of as having been obtained by choosing one element from each of the sets in A.
The axiom of choice certainly seems an innocent-enough assertion. And, in fact, most mathematicians today accept it as part of the set theory on which they base their mathematics. But in years past a good deal of controversy raged around this particular assertion concerning set theory, for there are theorems one can prove with its aid that some mathematicians were reluctant to accept. One such is the well-ordering theorem, which we shall discuss shortly. For the present we shall simply use the choice axiom to clear up the difﬁculty we mentioned in the preceding proof. First, we prove an easy consequence of the axiom of choice:
Lemma 9.2 (Existence of a choice function). Given a collection B of nonempty sets (not necessarily disjoint), there exists a function
c : B −→ B
B∈B
such that c(B) is an element of B, for each B ∈ B.
The function c is called a choice function for the collection B. The difference between this lemma and the axiom of choice is that in this lemma the sets of the collection B are not required to be disjoint. For example, one can allow B to be the collection of all nonempty subsets of a given set. Proof of the lemma. Given an element B of B, we deﬁne a set B as follows:
B = {(B, x) | x ∈ B}.
That is, B is the collection of all ordered pairs, where the ﬁrst coordinate of the ordered pair is the set B, and the second coordinate is an element of B. The set B is a subset of the cartesian product
B × B.
B∈B
Because B contains at least one element x, the set B contains at least the element (B, x), so it is nonempty.
Now we claim that if B1 and B2 are two different sets in B, then the corresponding sets B1 and B2 are disjoint. For the typical element of B1 is a pair of the form (B1, x1) and the typical element of B2 is a pair of the form (B2, x2). No two such elements can be equal, for their ﬁrst coordinates are different. Now let us form the collection
C = {B | B ∈ B};

57

60 Set Theory and Logic

Ch. 1

it is a collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of
B × B.
B∈B
By the choice axiom, there exists a set c consisting of exactly one element from each element of C. Our claim is that c is the rule for the desired choice function.
In the ﬁrst place, c is a subset of
B × B.
B∈B
In the second place, c contains exactly one element from each set B ; therefore, for each B ∈ B, the set c contains exactly one ordered pair (B, x) whose ﬁrst coordinate is B. Thus c is indeed the rule for a function from the collection B to the set B∈B B. Finally, if (B, x) ∈ c, then x belongs to B, so that c(B) ∈ B, as desired.
A second proof of Theorem 9.1. Using this lemma, one can make the proof of Theorem 9.1 more precise. Given the inﬁnite set A, we wish to construct an injective function f : Z+ → A. Let us form the collection B of all nonempty subsets of A. The lemma just proved asserts the existence of a choice function for B; that is, a function
c : B −→ B = A
B∈B
such that c(B) ∈ B for each B ∈ B. Let us now deﬁne a function f : Z+ → A by the recursion formula
f (1) = c(A), (∗)
f (i) = c(A − f ({1, . . . , i − 1})) for i > 1.
Because A is inﬁnite, the set A − f ({1, . . . , i − 1}) is nonempty; therefore, the right side of this equation makes sense. Since this formula deﬁnes f (i) uniquely in terms of f |{1, . . . , i − 1}, the principle of recursive deﬁnition applies. We conclude that there exists a unique function f : Z+ → A satisfying (∗) for all i ∈ Z+. Injectivity of f follows as before.
Having emphasized that in order to construct a proof of Theorem 9.1 that is logically correct, one must make speciﬁc use of a choice function, we now backtrack and admit that in practice most mathematicians do no such thing. They go on with no qualms giving proofs like our ﬁrst version, proofs that involve an inﬁnite number of arbitrary choices. They know that they are really using the choice axiom; and they know that if it were necessary, they could put their proofs into a logically more satisfactory form by introducing a choice function speciﬁcally. But usually they do not bother.
And neither will we. You will ﬁnd few further speciﬁc uses of a choice function in this book; we shall introduce a choice function only when the proof would become

58

§9

Inﬁnite Sets and the Axiom of Choice

61

confusing without it. But there will be many proofs in which we make an inﬁnite number of arbitrary choices, and in each such case we will actually be using the choice axiom implicitly.
Now we must confess that in an earlier section of this book there is a proof in which we constructed a certain function by making an inﬁnite number of arbitrary choices. And we slipped that proof in without even mentioning the choice axiom. Our apologies for the deception. We leave it to you to ferret out which proof it was!
Let us make one ﬁnal comment on the choice axiom. There are two forms of this axiom. One can be called the ﬁnite axiom of choice; it asserts that given a ﬁnite collection A of disjoint nonempty sets, there exists a set C consisting of exactly one element from each element of A. One needs this weak form of the choice axiom all the time; we have used it freely in the preceding sections with no comment. No mathematician has any qualms about the ﬁnite choice axiom; it is part of everyone’s set theory. Said differently, no one has qualms about a proof that involves only ﬁnitely many arbitrary choices.
The stronger form of the axiom of choice, the one that applies to an arbitrary collection A of nonempty sets, is the one that is properly called “the axiom of choice.” When a mathematician writes, “This proof depends on the choice axiom,” it is invariably this stronger form of the axiom that is meant.

Exercises
1. Deﬁne an injective map f : Z+ → X ω, where X is the two-element set {0, 1}, without using the choice axiom.
2. Find if possible a choice function for each of the following collections, without using the choice axiom: (a) The collection A of nonempty subsets of Z+. (b) The collection B of nonempty subsets of Z. (c) The collection C of nonempty subsets of the rational numbers Q. (d) The collection D of nonempty subsets of X ω, where X = {0, 1}.

fn : {1, . . . , n} −→ A.

5. (a) Use the choice axiom to show that if f : A → B is surjective, then f has a right inverse h : B → A.
(b) Show that if f : A → B is injective and A is not empty, then f has a left inverse. Is the axiom of choice needed?
6. Most of the famous paradoxes of naive set theory are associated in some way or other with the concept of the “set of all sets.” None of the rules we have given for forming sets allows us to consider such a set. And for good reason—the concept itself is self-contradictory. For suppose that A denotes the “set of all sets.” (a) Show that P (A) ⊂ A; derive a contradiction. (b) (Russell’s paradox.) Let B be the subset of A consisting of all sets that are not elements of themselves;
B = {A | A ∈ A and A ∈/ A}.
(Of course, there may be no set A such that A ∈ A; if such is the case, then B = A.) Is B an element of itself or not?
7. Let A and B be two nonempty sets. If there is an injection of B into A, but no injection of A into B, we say that A has greater cardinality than B. (a) Conclude from Theorem 9.1 that every uncountable set has greater cardinality than Z+. (b) Show that if A has greater cardinality than B, and B has greater cardinality than C, then A has greater cardinality than C. (c) Find a sequence A1, A2, . . . of inﬁnite sets, such that for each n ∈ Z+, the set An+1 has greater cardinality than An. (d) Find a set that for every n has cardinality greater than An.
*8. Show that P (Z+) and R have the same cardinality. [Hint: You may use the fact that every real number has a decimal expansion, which is unique if expansions that end in an inﬁnite string of 9’s are forbidden.] A famous conjecture of set theory, called the continuum hypothesis, asserts that there exists no set having greater cardinality than Z+ and lesser cardinality than R. The generalized continuum hypothesis asserts that, given the inﬁnite set A, there is no set having greater cardinality than A and lesser cardinality than P (A). Surprisingly enough, both of these assertions have been shown to be independent of the usual axioms for set theory. For a readable expository account, see [Sm].

§10 Well-Ordered Sets
One of the useful properties of the set Z+ of positive integers is the fact that each of its nonempty subsets has a smallest element. Generalizing this property leads to the concept of a well-ordered set.

60

§10

Well-Ordered Sets

63

Deﬁnition. A set A with an order relation < is said to be well-ordered if every nonempty subset of A has a smallest element.
EXAMPLE 1. Consider the set {1, 2} × Z+ in the dictionary ordering. Schematically, it can be represented as one inﬁnite sequence followed by another inﬁnite sequence:
a1, a2, a3, . . . ; b1, b2, b3, . . .
with the understanding that each element is less than every element to the right of it. It is not difﬁcult to see that every nonempty subset C of this ordered set has a smallest element: If C contains any one of the elements an, we simply take the smallest element of the intersection of C with the sequence a1, a2, . . . ; while if C contains no an, then it is a subset of the sequence b1, b2, . . . and as such has a smallest element.
EXAMPLE 2. Consider the set Z+ × Z+ in the dictionary order. Schematically, it can be represented as an inﬁnite sequence of inﬁnite sequences. We show that it is well-ordered. Let X be a nonempty subset of Z+ × Z+. Let A be the subset of Z+ consisting of all ﬁrst coordinates of elements of X . Now A has a smallest element; call it a0. Then the collection
{b | a0 × b ∈ X }
is a nonempty subset of Z+; let b0 be its smallest element. By deﬁnition of the dictionary order, a0 × b0 is the smallest element of X . See Figure 10.1.

Figure 10.1
EXAMPLE 3. The set of integers is not well-ordered in the usual order; the subset consisting of the negative integers has no smallest element. Nor is the set of real numbers in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 well-ordered; the subset consisting of those x for which 0 < x < 1 has no smallest element (although it has a greatest lower bound, of course). There are several ways of constructing well-ordered sets. Two of them are the following: (1) If A is a well-ordered set, then any subset of A is well-ordered in the restricted
order relation.

61

64 Set Theory and Logic

Ch. 1

(2) If A and B are well-ordered sets, then A × B is well-ordered in the dictionary order.
The proof of (1) is trivial; the proof of (2) follows the pattern given in Example 2. It follows that the set Z+ × (Z+ × Z+) is well-ordered in the dictionary order; it
can be represented as an inﬁnite sequence of inﬁnite sequences of inﬁnite sequences. Similarly, (Z+)4 is well-ordered in the dictionary order. And so on. But if you try to generalize to an inﬁnite product of Z+ with itself, you will run into trouble. We shall examine this situation shortly.
Now, given a set A without an order relation, it is natural to ask whether there exists an order relation for A that makes it into a well-ordered set. If A is ﬁnite, any bijection
f : A −→ {1, . . . , n}
can be used to deﬁne an order relation on A; under this relation, A has the same order type as the ordered set {1, . . . , n}. In fact, every order relation on a ﬁnite set can be obtained in this way:
Theorem 10.1. Every nonempty ﬁnite ordered set has the order type of a section {1, . . . , n} of Z+, so it is well-ordered.
Proof. This was given as an exercise in §6; we prove it here. First, we show that every ﬁnite ordered set A has a largest element. If A has one element, this is trivial. Supposing it true for sets having n − 1 elements, let A have n elements and let a0 ∈ A. Then A − {a0} has a largest element a1, and the larger of {a0, a1} is the largest element of A.
Second, we show there is an order-preserving bijection of A with {1, . . . , n} for some n. If A has one element, this fact is trivial. Suppose that it is true for sets having n − 1 elements. Let b be the largest element of A. By hypothesis, there is an order-preserving bijection
f : A − {b} −→ {1, . . . , n − 1}.
Deﬁne an order-preserving bijection f : A → {1, . . . , n} by setting
f (x) = f (x) for x = b, f (b) = n.

Thus, a ﬁnite ordered set has only one possible order type. For an inﬁnite set, things are quite different. The well-ordered sets
Z+, {1, . . . , n} × Z+, Z+ × Z+, Z+ × (Z+ × Z+)

§10

Well-Ordered Sets

are all countably inﬁnite, but they all have different order types, as you can check. All the examples we have given of well-ordered sets are orderings of countable
sets. It is natural to ask whether one can ﬁnd a well-ordered uncountable set. The obvious uncountable set to try is the countably inﬁnite product
X = Z+ × Z+ × · · · = (Z+)ω
of Z+ with itself. One can generalize the dictionary order to this set in a natural way, by deﬁning

if for some n ≥ 1,

(a1, a2, . . . ) < (b1, b2, . . . )

ai = bi , for i < n and an < bn.

This is, in fact, an order relation on the set X ; but unfortunately it is not a well-ordering. Consider the set A of all elements x of X of the form

x = (1, . . . , 1, 2, 1, 1, . . . ),

where exactly one coordinate of x equals 2, and the others are all equal to 1. The set A
clearly has no smallest element. Thus, the dictionary order at least does not give a well-ordering of the set (Z+)ω.
Is there some other order relation on this set that is a well-ordering? No one has ever constructed a speciﬁc well-ordering of (Z+)ω. Nevertheless, there is a famous theorem that says such a well-ordering exists:

Theorem (Well-ordering theorem). If A is a set, there exists an order relation on A that is a well-ordering.
This theorem was proved by Zermelo in 1904, and it startled the mathematical world. There was considerable debate as to the correctness of the proof; the lack of any constructive procedure for well-ordering an arbitrary uncountable set led many to be skeptical. When the proof was analyzed closely, the only point at which it was found that there might be some question was a construction involving an inﬁnite number of arbitrary choices, that is, a construction involving—the choice axiom.
Some mathematicians rejected the choice axiom as a result, and for many years a legitimate question about a new theorem was: Does its proof involve the choice axiom or not? A theorem was considered to be on somewhat shaky ground if one had to use the choice axiom in its proof. Present-day mathematicians, by and large, do not have such qualms. They accept the axiom of choice as a reasonable assumption about set theory, and they accept the well-ordering theorem along with it.
The proof that the choice axiom implies the well-ordering theorem is rather long (although not exceedingly difﬁcult) and primarily of interest to logicians; we shall omit it. If you are interested, a proof is outlined in the supplementary exercises at the end

of the chapter. Instead, we shall simply assume the well-ordering theorem whenever we need it. Consider it to be an additional axiom of set theory if you like!
We shall in fact need the full strength of this assumption only occasionally. Most of the time, all we need is the following weaker result:
Corollary. There exists an uncountable well-ordered set. We now use this result to construct a particular well-ordered set that will prove to
be very useful.
Deﬁnition. Let X be a well-ordered set. Given α ∈ X , let Sα denote the set Sα = {x | x ∈ X and x < α}.
It is called the section of X by α.

Lemma 10.2. There exists a well-ordered set A having a largest element , such that the section S of A by is uncountable but every other section of A is countable.
Proof. We begin with an uncountable well-ordered set B. Let C be the well-ordered set {1, 2} × B in the dictionary order; then some section of C is uncountable. (Indeed, the section of C by any element of the form 2 × b is uncountable.) Let be the smallest element of C for which the section of C by is uncountable. Then let A consist of this section along with the element .
Note that S is an uncountable well-ordered set every section of which is countable. Its order type is in fact uniquely determined by this condition. We shall call it a minimal uncountable well-ordered set. Furthermore, we shall denote the well-ordered set A = S ∪ { } by the symbol S¯ (for reasons to be seen later).
The most useful property of the set S for our purposes is expressed in the following theorem:
Theorem 10.3. If A is a countable subset of S , then A has an upper bound in S .
Proof. Let A be a countable subset of S . For each a ∈ A, the section Sa is countable. Therefore, the union B = a∈A Sa is also countable. Since S is uncountable, the set B is not all of S ; let x be a point of S that is not in B. Then x is an upper bound for A. For if x < a for some a in A, then x belongs to Sa and hence to B, contrary to choice.

∗§11 The Maximum Principle†
We have already indicated that the axiom of choice leads to the deep theorem that every set can be well-ordered. The axiom of choice has other consequences that are even more important in mathematics. Collectively referred to as “maximum principles,” they come in many versions. Formulated independently by a number of mathematicians, including F. Hausdorff, K. Kuratowski, S. Bochner, and M. Zorn, during the years 1914–1935, they were typically proved as consequences of the well-ordering theorem. Later, it was realized that they were in fact equivalent to the well-ordering theorem. We consider several of them here.
First, we make a deﬁnition. Given a set A, a relation ≺ on A is called a strict partial order on A if it has the following two properties:
(1) (Nonreﬂexivity) The relation a ≺ a never holds. (2) (Transitivity) If a ≺ b and b ≺ c, then a ≺ c. These are just the second and third of the properties of a simple order (see §3); the comparability property is the one that is omitted. In other words, a strict partial order behaves just like a simple order except that it need not be true that for every pair of distinct points x and y in the set, either x ≺ y or y ≺ x.
If ≺ is a strict partial order on a set A, it can easily happen that some subset B of A is simply ordered by the relation; all that is needed is for every pair of elements of B to be comparable under ≺.
†This section will be assumed in Chapters 5 and 14.

§11

The Maximum Principle

69

Now we can state the following principle, which was ﬁrst formulated by Hausdorff in 1914.
Theorem (The maximum principle). Let A be a set; let ≺ be a strict partial order on A. Then there exists a maximal simply ordered subset B of A.
Said differently, there exists a subset B of A such that B is simply ordered by ≺ and such that no subset of A that properly contains B is simply ordered by ≺.
EXAMPLE 1. If A is any collection of sets, the relation “is a proper subset of” is a strict partial order on A. Suppose that A is the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane. One maximal simply ordered subcollection of A consists of all circular regions with centers at the origin. Another maximal simply ordered subcollection consists of all circular regions bounded by circles tangent from the right to the y-axis at the origin. See Figure 11.1.

Figure 11.1
EXAMPLE 2. If (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) are two points of the plane R2, deﬁne (x0, y0) ≺ (x1, y1)
if y0 = y1 and x0 < x1. This is a partial ordering of R2 under which two points are comparable only if they lie on the same horizontal line. The maximal simply ordered sets are the horizontal lines in R2. One can give an intuitive “proof” of the maximum principle that is rather appealing. It involves a step-by-step procedure, which one can describe in physical terms as follows. Suppose we take a box, and put into it some of the elements of A according to the following plan: First we pick an arbitrary element of A and put it in the box. Then we pick another element of A. If it is comparable with the element in the box, we put it in the box too; otherwise, we throw it away. At the general step, we will have a collection of elements in the box and a collection of elements that have been tossed away. Take one of the remaining elements of A. If it is comparable with everything in the box, toss it in the box, too; otherwise, throw it away. Similarly continue. After
67

70 Set Theory and Logic

Ch. 1

you have checked all the elements of A, the elements you have in the box will be comparable with one another, and thus they will form a simply ordered set. Every element not in the box will be noncomparable with at least one element in the box, for that was why it was tossed away. Hence, the simply ordered set in the box is maximal, for no larger subset of A can satisfy the comparability condition.
Now of course the weak point in the preceding “proof” comes when we said, “After you have checked all the elements of A.” How do you know you ever “get through” checking all the elements of A? If A should happen to be countable, it is not hard to make this intuitive proof into a real proof. Let us take the countably inﬁnite case; the ﬁnite case is even easier. Index the elements of A bijectively with the positive integers, so that A = {a1, a2 . . . }. This indexing gives a way of deciding what order to test the elements of A in, and how to know when one has tested them all.
Now we deﬁne a function h : Z+ → {0, 1}, by letting it assign the value 0 to i if we “put ai in the box,” and the value 1 if we “throw ai away.” This means that h(1) = 0, and for i > 1, we have h(i) = 0 if and only if ai is comparable with every element of the set
{a j | j < i and h( j) = 0}.
By the principle of recursive deﬁnition, this formula determines a unique function h : Z+ → {0, 1}. It is easy to check that the set of those a j for which h( j) = 0 is a maximal simply ordered subset of A.
If A is not countable, a variant of this procedure will work, if we allow ourselves to use the well-ordering theorem. Instead of indexing the elements of A with the set Z+, we index them (in a bijective fashion) with the elements of some well-ordered set J , so that A = {aα | α ∈ J }. For this we need the well-ordering theorem, so that we know there is a bijection between A and some well-ordered set J . Then we can proceed as in the previous paragraph, letting α replace i in the argument. Strictly speaking, you need to generalize the principle of recursive deﬁnition to well-ordered sets as well, but that is not particularly difﬁcult. (See the Supplementary Exercises.)
Thus, the well-ordering theorem implies the maximum principle. Although the maximum principle of Hausdorff was the ﬁrst to be formulated and is probably the simplest to understand, there is another such principle that is nowadays the one most frequently quoted. It is popularly called “Zorn’s Lemma,” although Kuratowski (1922) and Bochner (1922) preceded Zorn (1935) in enunciating and proving versions of it. For a history and discussion of the tangled history of these ideas, see [C] or [Mo]. To state this principle, we need some terminology.
Deﬁnition. Let A be a set and let ≺ be a strict partial order on A. If B is a subset of A, an upper bound on B is an element c of A such that for every b in B, either b = c or b ≺ c. A maximal element of A is an element m of A such that for no element a of A does the relation m ≺ a hold.
Zorn’s Lemma. Let A be a set that is strictly partially ordered. If every simply ordered subset of A has an upper bound in A, then A has a maximal element.

68

§11

The Maximum Principle

71

Zorn’s lemma is an easy consequence of the maximum principle: Given A, the maximum principle implies that A has a maximal simply ordered subset B. The hypothesis of Zorn’s lemma tells us that B has an upper bound c in A. The element c is then automatically a maximal element of A. For if c ≺ d for some element d of A, then the set B ∪ {d}, which properly contains B, is simply ordered because b ≺ d for every b ∈ B. This fact contradicts maximality of B.
It is also true that the maximum principle is an easy consequence of Zorn’s lemma. See Exercises 5–7.
One ﬁnal remark. We have deﬁned what we mean by a strict partial order on a set, but we have not said what a partial order itself is. Let ≺ be a strict partial order on a set A. Suppose that we deﬁne a b if either a ≺ b or a = b. Then the relation is called a partial order on A. For example, the inclusion relation ⊂ on a collection of sets is a partial order, whereas proper inclusion is a strict partial order.
Many authors prefer to deal with partial orderings rather than strict partial orderings; the maximum principle and Zorn’s lemma are often expressed in these terms. Which formulation is used is simply a matter of taste and convenience.

Exercises
1. If a and b are real numbers, deﬁne a ≺ b if b − a is positive and rational. Show this is a strict partial order on R. What are the maximal simply ordered subsets?
2. (a) Let ≺ be a strict partial order on the set A. Deﬁne a relation on A by letting a b if either a ≺ b or a = b. Show that this relation has the following properties, which are called the partial order axioms: (i) a a for all a ∈ A. (ii) a b and b a ⇒ a = b. (iii) a b and b c ⇒ a c.
(b) Let P be a relation on A that satisﬁes properties (i)–(iii). Deﬁne a relation S on A by letting aSb if a Pb and a = b. Show that S is a strict partial order on A.
3. Let A be a set with a strict partial order ≺; let x ∈ A. Suppose that we wish to ﬁnd a maximal simply ordered subset B of A that contains x. One plausible way of attempting to deﬁne B is to let B equal the set of all those elements of A that are comparable with x;
B = {y | y ∈ A and either x ≺ y or y ≺ x}.
But this will not always work. In which of Examples 1 and 2 will this procedure succeed and in which will it not? 4. Given two points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) of R2, deﬁne
(x0, y0) ≺ (x1, y1)

if x0 < x1 and y0 ≤ y1. Show that the curves y = x3 and y = 2 are maximal simply ordered subsets of R2, and the curve y = x2 is not. Find all maximal simply ordered subsets.
5. Show that Zorn’s lemma implies the following: Lemma (Kuratowski). Let A be a collection of sets. Suppose that for every subcollection B of A that is simply ordered by proper inclusion, the union of the elements of B belongs to A. Then A has an element that is properly contained in no other element of A.
6. A collection A of subsets of a set X is said to be of ﬁnite type provided that a subset B of X belongs to A if and only if every ﬁnite subset of B belongs to A. Show that the Kuratowski lemma implies the following: Lemma (Tukey, 1940). Let A be a collection of sets. If A is of ﬁnite type, then A has an element that is properly contained in no other element of A.
7. Show that the Tukey lemma implies the Hausdorff maximum principle. [Hint: If ≺ is a strict partial order on A, let A be the collection of all subsets of A that are simply ordered by ≺. Show that A is of ﬁnite type.]
8. A typical use of Zorn’s lemma in algebra is the proof that every vector space has a basis. Recall that if A is a subset of the vector space V , we say a vector belongs to the span of A if it equals a ﬁnite linear combination of elements of A. The set A is independent if the only ﬁnite linear combination of elements of A that equals the zero vector is the trivial one having all coefﬁcients zero. If A is independent and if every vector in V belongs to the span of A, then A is a basis for V . (a) If A is independent and v ∈ V does not belong to the span of A, show A∪{v} is independent. (b) Show the collection of all independent sets in V has a maximal element. (c) Show that V has a basis.

∗Supplementary Exercises: Well-Ordering
In the following exercises, we ask you to prove the equivalence of the choice axiom, the well-ordering theorem, and the maximum principle. We comment that of these exercises, only Exercise 7 uses the choice axiom.
1. Theorem (General principle of recursive deﬁnition). Let J be a well-ordered set; let C be a set. Let F be the set of all functions mapping sections of J into C.

(ii) h(α) = smallest [E − h(Sα)] for all α. [Hint: Show that each of these conditions implies that h(Sα) is a section of E; conclude that it must be the section by h(α).] (b) If E is a well-ordered set, show that no section of E has the order type of E, nor do two different sections of E have the same order type. [Hint: Given J , there is at most one order-preserving map of J into E whose image is E or a section of E.]
3. Let J and E be well-ordered sets; suppose there is an order-preserving map k : J → E. Using Exercises 1 and 2, show that J has the order type of E or a section of E. [Hint: Choose e0 ∈ E. Deﬁne h : J → E by the recursion formula
h(α) = smallest [E − h(Sα)] if h(Sα) = E,
and h(α) = e0 otherwise. Show that h(α) ≤ k(α) for all α; conclude that h(Sα) = E for all α.] 4. Use Exercises 1–3 to prove the following: (a) If A and B are well-ordered sets, then exactly one of the following three
conditions holds: A and B have the same order type, or A has the order type of a section of B, or B has the order type of a section of A. [Hint: Form a well-ordered set containing both A and B, as in Exercise 8 of §10; then apply the preceding exercise.] (b) Suppose that A and B are well-ordered sets that are uncountable, such that every section of A and of B is countable. Show A and B have the same order type.
5. Let X be a set; let A be the collection of all pairs (A, <), where A is a subset of X and < is a well-ordering of A. Deﬁne
(A, <) ≺ (A , < )
if (A, <) equals a section of (A , < ). (a) Show that ≺ is a strict partial order on A. (b) Let B be a subcollection of A that is simply ordered by ≺. Deﬁne B to be
the union of the sets B, for all (B, <) ∈ B; and deﬁne < to be the union of the relations <, for all (B, <) ∈ B. Show that (B , < ) is a well-ordered set.
6. Use Exercises 1 and 5 to prove the following: Theorem. The maximum principle is equivalent to the well-ordering theorem.
7. Use Exercises 1–5 to prove the following: Theorem. The choice axiom is equivalent to the well-ordering theorem. Proof. Let X be a set; let c be a ﬁxed choice function for the nonempty subsets of X . If T is a subset of X and < is a relation on T , we say that (T, <) is a tower in X if < is a well-ordering of T and if for each x ∈ T ,

ing indices if necessary, we can assume that h : T1 → T2 is order preserving and h(T1) equals either T2 or a section of T2. Use Exercise 2 to show that h(x) = x for all x.] (b) If (T, <) is a tower in X and T = X , show there is a tower in X of which (T, <) is a section.

8. Using Exercises 1–4, construct an uncountable well-ordered set, as follows. Let A be the collection of all pairs (A, <), where A is a subset of Z+ and < is a wellordering of A. (We allow A to be empty.) Deﬁne (A, <) ∼ (A , < ) if (A, <) and (A , < ) have the same order type. It is trivial to show this is an equivalence relation. Let [(A, <)] denote the equivalence class of (A, <); let E denote the
collection of these equivalence classes. Deﬁne

[(A, <)] [(A , < )]

if (A, <) has the order type of a section of (A , < ). (a) Show that the relation is well deﬁned and is a simple order on E. Note
that the equivalence class [(∅, ∅)] is the smallest element of E. (b) Show that if α = [(A, <)] is an element of E, then (A, <) has the same
order type as the section Sα(E) of E by α. [Hint: Deﬁne a map f : A → E by setting f (x) = [(Sx (A), restriction of <)] for each x ∈ A.] (c) Conclude that E is well-ordered by . (d) Show that E is uncountable. [Hint: If h : E → Z+ is a bijection, then h gives rise to a well-ordering of Z+.] This same argument, with Z+ replaced by an arbitrary well-ordered set X , proves (without use of the choice axiom) the existence of a well-ordered set E whose cardinality is greater than that of X . This exercise shows that one can construct an uncountable well-ordered set, and hence the minimal uncountable well-ordered set, by an explicit construction that does not use the choice axiom. However, this result is less interesting than it might appear. The crucial property of S , the one we use repeatedly, is the fact that every countable subset of S has an upper bound in S . That fact depends, in turn, on the fact that a countable union of countable sets is countable. And the proof of that result (if you examine it carefully) involves an inﬁnite number of arbitrary choices—that is, it depends on the choice axiom. Said differently, without the choice axiom we may be able to construct the minimal uncountable well-ordered set, but we can’t use it for anything!

Chapter 2
Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions
The concept of topological space grew out of the study of the real line and euclidean space and the study of continuous functions on these spaces. In this chapter, we deﬁne what a topological space is, and we study a number of ways of constructing a topology on a set so as to make it into a topological space. We also consider some of the elementary concepts associated with topological spaces. Open and closed sets, limit points, and continuous functions are introduced as natural generalizations of the corresponding ideas for the real line and euclidean space.
§12 Topological Spaces
The deﬁnition of a topological space that is now standard was a long time in being formulated. Various mathematicians—Fre´chet, Hausdorff, and others—proposed different deﬁnitions over a period of years during the ﬁrst decades of the twentieth century, but it took quite a while before mathematicians settled on the one that seemed most suitable. They wanted, of course, a deﬁnition that was as broad as possible, so that it would include as special cases all the various examples that were useful in mathematics—euclidean space, inﬁnite-dimensional euclidean space, and function spaces among them—but they also wanted the deﬁnition to be narrow enough that the standard theorems about these familiar spaces would hold for topological spaces in

general. This is always the problem when one is trying to formulate a new mathematical concept, to decide how general its deﬁnition should be. The deﬁnition ﬁnally settled on may seem a bit abstract, but as you work through the various ways of constructing topological spaces, you will get a better feeling for what the concept means.
Deﬁnition. A topology on a set X is a collection T of subsets of X having the following properties:
(1) ∅ and X are in T .
(2) The union of the elements of any subcollection of T is in T .
(3) The intersection of the elements of any ﬁnite subcollection of T is in T . A set X for which a topology T has been speciﬁed is called a topological space.
Properly speaking, a topological space is an ordered pair (X, T ) consisting of a set X and a topology T on X , but we often omit speciﬁc mention of T if no confusion will arise.
If X is a topological space with topology T , we say that a subset U of X is an open set of X if U belongs to the collection T . Using this terminology, one can say that a topological space is a set X together with a collection of subsets of X , called open sets, such that ∅ and X are both open, and such that arbitrary unions and ﬁnite intersections of open sets are open.
EXAMPLE 1. Let X be a three-element set, X = {a, b, c}. There are many possible topologies on X , some of which are indicated schematically in Figure 12.1. The diagram in the upper right-hand corner indicates the topology in which the open sets are X , ∅, {a, b}, {b}, and {b, c}. The topology in the upper left-hand corner contains only X and ∅, while the topology in the lower right-hand corner contains every subset of X . You can get other topologies on X by permuting a, b, and c.

Figure 12.1 From this example, you can see that even a three-element set has many different topologies. But not every collection of subsets of X is a topology on X . Neither of the collections indicated in Figure 12.2 is a topology, for instance.

EXAMPLE 2. If X is any set, the collection of all subsets of X is a topology on X ; it is called the discrete topology. The collection consisting of X and ∅ only is also a topology on X ; we shall call it the indiscrete topology, or the trivial topology.

EXAMPLE 3. Let X be a set; let T f be the collection of all subsets U of X such that X −U either is ﬁnite or is all of X . Then T f is a topology on X , called the ﬁnite complement topology. Both X and ∅ are in T f , since X − X is ﬁnite and X − ∅ is all of X . If {Uα} is an indexed family of nonempty elements of T f , to show that Uα is in T f , we compute

X − Uα = (X − Uα).

The latter set is ﬁnite because each set X − Uα is ﬁnite. If U1, . . . , Un are nonempty elements of T f , to show that Ui is in T f , we compute

X − Ui = (X − Ui ).

The latter set is a ﬁnite union of ﬁnite sets and, therefore, ﬁnite.

EXAMPLE 4. Let X be a set; let Tc be the collection of all subsets U of X such that X − U either is countable or is all of X . Then Tc is a topology on X , as you can check.

Deﬁnition. Suppose that T and T are two topologies on a given set X . If T ⊃ T , we say that T is ﬁner than T ; if T properly contains T , we say that T is strictly ﬁner than T . We also say that T is coarser than T , or strictly coarser, in these two respective situations. We say T is comparable with T if either T ⊃ T or T ⊃ T .
This terminology is suggested by thinking of a topological space as being something like a truckload full of gravel—the pebbles and all unions of collections of pebbles being the open sets. If now we smash the pebbles into smaller ones, the collection of open sets has been enlarged, and the topology, like the gravel, is said to have been made ﬁner by the operation.
Two topologies on X need not be comparable, of course. In Figure 12.1 preceding, the topology in the upper right-hand corner is strictly ﬁner than each of the three topologies in the ﬁrst column and strictly coarser than each of the other topologies in the third column. But it is not comparable with any of the topologies in the second column.
Other terminology is sometimes used for this concept. If T ⊃ T , some mathematicians would say that T is larger than T , and T is smaller than T . This is certainly acceptable terminology, if not as vivid as the words “ﬁner” and “coarser.”

Many mathematicians use the words “weaker” and “stronger” in this context. Unfortunately, some of them (particularly analysts) are apt to say that T is stronger than T if T ⊃ T , while others (particularly topologists) are apt to say that T is weaker than T in the same situation! If you run across the terms “strong topology” or “weak topology” in some book, you will have to decide from the context which inclusion is meant. We shall not use these terms in this book.

§13 Basis for a Topology
For each of the examples in the preceding section, we were able to specify the topology by describing the entire collection T of open sets. Usually this is too difﬁcult. In most cases, one speciﬁes instead a smaller collection of subsets of X and deﬁnes the topology in terms of that.
Deﬁnition. If X is a set, a basis for a topology on X is a collection B of subsets of X (called basis elements) such that
(1) For each x ∈ X , there is at least one basis element B containing x. (2) If x belongs to the intersection of two basis elements B1 and B2, then there is a
basis element B3 containing x such that B3 ⊂ B1 ∩ B2. If B satisﬁes these two conditions, then we deﬁne the topology T generated by B as follows: A subset U of X is said to be open in X (that is, to be an element of T ) if for each x ∈ U , there is a basis element B ∈ B such that x ∈ B and B ⊂ U . Note that each basis element is itself an element of T .
We will check shortly that the collection T is indeed a topology on X . But ﬁrst let us consider some examples.
EXAMPLE 1. Let B be the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane. Then B satisﬁes both conditions for a basis. The second condition is illustrated in Figure 13.1. In the topology generated by B, a subset U of the plane is open if every x in U lies in some circular region contained in U .

EXAMPLE 2. Let B be the collection of all rectangular regions (interiors of rectangles) in the plane, where the rectangles have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Then B satisﬁes both conditions for a basis. The second condition is illustrated in Figure 13.2; in this case, the condition is trivial, because the intersection of any two basis elements is itself a basis element (or empty). As we shall see later, the basis B generates the same topology on the plane as the basis B given in the preceding example.
EXAMPLE 3. If X is any set, the collection of all one-point subsets of X is a basis for the discrete topology on X .
Let us check now that the collection T generated by the basis B is, in fact, a topology on X . If U is the empty set, it satisﬁes the deﬁning condition of openness vacuously. Likewise, X is in T , since for each x ∈ X there is some basis element B containing x and contained in X . Now let us take an indexed family {Uα}α∈J , of elements of T and show that
U = Uα
α∈J
belongs to T . Given x ∈ U , there is an index α such that x ∈ Uα. Since Uα is open, there is a basis element B such that x ∈ B ⊂ Uα. Then x ∈ B and B ⊂ U , so that U is open, by deﬁnition.
Now let us take two elements U1 and U2 of T and show that U1 ∩U2 belongs to T . Given x ∈ U1 ∩U2, choose a basis element B1 containing x such that B1 ⊂ U1; choose also a basis element B2 containing x such that B2 ⊂ U2. The second condition for a basis enables us to choose a basis element B3 containing x such that B3 ⊂ B1 ∩ B2. See Figure 13.3. Then x ∈ B3 and B3 ⊂ U1 ∩ U2, so U1 ∩ U2 belongs to T , by deﬁnition.

Finally, we show by induction that any ﬁnite intersection U1 ∩· · ·∩Un of elements of T is in T . This fact is trivial for n = 1; we suppose it true for n − 1 and prove it for n. Now
(U1 ∩ · · · ∩ Un) = (U1 ∩ · · · ∩ Un−1) ∩ Un.

77

80 Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions

Ch. 2

By hypothesis, U1 ∩ · · · ∩ Un−1 belongs to T ; by the result just proved, the intersection of U1 ∩ · · · ∩ Un−1 and Un also belongs to T .
Thus we have checked that collection of open sets generated by a basis B is, in fact, a topology.
Another way of describing the topology generated by a basis is given in the fol-
lowing lemma:

Lemma 13.1. Let X be a set; let B be a basis for a topology T on X . Then T equals the collection of all unions of elements of B.
Proof. Given a collection of elements of B, they are also elements of T . Because T is a topology, their union is in T . Conversely, given U ∈ T , choose for each x ∈ U an element Bx of B such that x ∈ Bx ⊂ U . Then U = x∈U Bx , so U equals a union of elements of B.

This lemma states that every open set U in X can be expressed as a union of basis elements. This expression for U is not, however, unique. Thus the use of the term “basis” in topology differs drastically from its use in linear algebra, where the equation expressing a given vector as a linear combination of basis vectors is unique.
We have described in two different ways how to go from a basis to the topology it generates. Sometimes we need to go in the reverse direction, from a topology to a basis generating it. Here is one way of obtaining a basis for a given topology; we shall use it frequently.

Lemma 13.2. Let X be a topological space. Suppose that C is a collection of open sets of X such that for each open set U of X and each x in U , there is an element C of C such that x ∈ C ⊂ U . Then C is a basis for the topology of X .
Proof. We must show that C is a basis. The ﬁrst condition for a basis is easy: Given x ∈ X , since X is itself an open set, there is by hypothesis an element C of C such that x ∈ C ⊂ X . To check the second condition, let x belong to C1 ∩ C2, where C1 and C2 are elements of C. Since C1 and C2 are open, so is C1 ∩ C2. Therefore, there exists by hypothesis an element C3 in C such that x ∈ C3 ⊂ C1 ∩ C2.
Let T be the collection of open sets of X ; we must show that the topology T generated by C equals the topology T . First, note that if U belongs to T and if x ∈ U , then there is by hypothesis an element C of C such that x ∈ C ⊂ U . It follows that U belongs to the topology T , by deﬁnition. Conversely, if W belongs to the topology T , then W equals a union of elements of C, by the preceding lemma. Since each element of C belongs to T and T is a topology, W also belongs to T .

When topologies are given by bases, it is useful to have a criterion in terms of the bases for determining whether one topology is ﬁner than another. One such criterion is the following:

78

§13

Basis for a Topology

81

Lemma 13.3. Let B and B be bases for the topologies T and T , respectively, on X . Then the following are equivalent: (1) T is ﬁner than T . (2) For each x ∈ X and each basis element B ∈ B containing x, there is a basis
element B ∈ B such that x ∈ B ⊂ B.
Proof. (2) ⇒ (1). Given an element U of T , we wish to show that U ∈ T . Let x ∈ U . Since B generates T , there is an element B ∈ B such that x ∈ B ⊂ U . Condition (2) tells us there exists an element B ∈ B such that x ∈ B ⊂ B. Then x ∈ B ⊂ U , so U ∈ T , by deﬁnition.
(1) ⇒ (2). We are given x ∈ X and B ∈ B, with x ∈ B. Now B belongs to T by deﬁnition and T ⊂ T by condition (1); therefore, B ∈ T . Since T is generated by B , there is an element B ∈ B such that x ∈ B ⊂ B.
Some students ﬁnd this condition hard to remember. “Which way does the inclusion go?” they ask. It may be easier to remember if you recall the analogy between a topological space and a truckload full of gravel. Think of the pebbles as the basis elements of the topology; after the pebbles are smashed to dust, the dust particles are the basis elements of the new topology. The new topology is ﬁner than the old one, and each dust particle was contained inside a pebble, as the criterion states.
EXAMPLE 4. One can now see that the collection B of all circular regions in the plane generates the same topology as the collection B of all rectangular regions; Figure 13.4 illustrates the proof. We shall treat this example more formally when we study metric spaces.

Figure 13.4
We now deﬁne three topologies on the real line R, all of which are of interest.
Deﬁnition. If B is the collection of all open intervals in the real line, (a, b) = {x | a < x < b},
the topology generated by B is called the standard topology on the real line. Whenever we consider R, we shall suppose it is given this topology unless we speciﬁcally state otherwise. If B is the collection of all half-open intervals of the form
[a, b) = {x | a ≤ x < b},

79

82 Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions

Ch. 2

where a < b, the topology generated by B is called the lower limit topology on R. When R is given the lower limit topology, we denote it by R . Finally let K denote the set of all numbers of the form 1/n, for n ∈ Z+, and let B be the collection of all open intervals (a, b), along with all sets of the form (a, b) − K . The topology generated by B will be called the K-topology on R. When R is given this topology, we denote it by RK .
It is easy to see that all three of these collections are bases; in each case, the intersection of two basis elements is either another basis element or is empty. The relation between these topologies is the following:
Lemma 13.4. The topologies of R and RK are strictly ﬁner than the standard topology on R, but are not comparable with one another.
Proof. Let T , T , and T be the topologies of R, R , and RK , respectively. Given a basis element (a, b) for T and a point x of (a, b), the basis element [x, b) for T contains x and lies in (a, b). On the other hand, given the basis element [x, d) for T , there is no open interval (a, b) that contains x and lies in [x, d). Thus T is strictly ﬁner than T .
A similar argument applies to RK . Given a basis element (a, b) for T and a point x of (a, b), this same interval is a basis element for T that contains x. On the other hand, given the basis element B = (−1, 1) − K for T and the point 0 of B, there is no open interval that contains 0 and lies in B.
We leave it to you to show that the topologies of R and RK are not comparable.

A question may occur to you at this point. Since the topology generated by a basis B may be described as the collection of arbitrary unions of elements of B, what happens if you start with a given collection of sets and take ﬁnite intersections of them as well as arbitrary unions? This question leads to the notion of a subbasis for a topology.

Deﬁnition. A subbasis for a topology on X is a collection of subsets of X whose union equals X . The topology generated by the subbasis is deﬁned to be the collection T of all unions of ﬁnite intersections of elements of .

We must of course check that T is a topology. For this purpose it will sufﬁce to show that the collection B of all ﬁnite intersections of elements of is a basis, for then the collection T of all unions of elements of B is a topology, by Lemma 13.1. Given x ∈ X , it belongs to an element of and hence to an element of B; this is the ﬁrst condition for a basis. To check the second condition, let

B1 = S1 ∩ · · · ∩ Sm and be two elements of B. Their intersection

B2 = S1 ∩ · · · ∩ Sn

B1 ∩ B2 = (S1 ∩ · · · ∩ Sm) ∩ (S1 ∩ · · · ∩ Sn)

is also a ﬁnite intersection of elements of , so it belongs to B.

is a basis that generates the standard topology on R. (b) Show that the collection
C = {[a, b) | a < b, a and b rational}
is a basis that generates a topology different from the lower limit topology on R.

§14 The Order Topology
If X is a simply ordered set, there is a standard topology for X , deﬁned using the order relation. It is called the order topology; in this section, we consider it and study some of its properties.
Suppose that X is a set having a simple order relation <. Given elements a and b of X such that a < b, there are four subsets of X that are called the intervals determined by a and b. They are the following :
(a, b) = {x | a < x < b}, (a, b] = {x | a < x ≤ b}, [a, b) = {x | a ≤ x < b}, [a, b] = {x | a ≤ x ≤ b}.
The notation used here is familiar to you already in the case where X is the real line, but these are intervals in an arbitrary ordered set. A set of the ﬁrst type is called an open interval in X , a set of the last type is called a closed interval in X , and sets of the second and third types are called half-open intervals. The use of the term “open” in this connection suggests that open intervals in X should turn out to be open sets when we put a topology on X . And so they will.
Deﬁnition. Let X be a set with a simple order relation; assume X has more than one element. Let B be the collection of all sets of the following types:
(1) All open intervals (a, b) in X . (2) All intervals of the form [a0, b), where a0 is the smallest element (if any) of X . (3) All intervals of the form (a, b0], where b0 is the largest element (if any) of X . The collection B is a basis for a topology on X , which is called the order topology.
If X has no smallest element, there are no sets of type (2), and if X has no largest element, there are no sets of type (3).
One has to check that B satisﬁes the requirements for a basis. First, note that every element x of X lies in at least one element of B: The smallest element (if any) lies in all sets of type (2), the largest element (if any) lies in all sets of type (3), and every other element lies in a set of type (1). Second, note that the intersection of any two sets of the preceding types is again a set of one of these types, or is empty. Several cases need to be checked; we leave it to you.

The Order Topology

EXAMPLE 1. The standard topology on R, as deﬁned in the preceding section, is just the order topology derived from the usual order on R.
EXAMPLE 2. Consider the set R × R in the dictionary order; we shall denote the general element of R × R by x × y, to avoid difﬁculty with notation. The set R × R has neither a largest nor a smallest element, so the order topology on R × R has as basis the collection of all open intervals of the form (a × b, c × d) for a < c, and for a = c and b < d. These two types of intervals are indicated in Figure 14.1. The subcollection consisting of only intervals of the second type is also a basis for the order topology on R × R, as you can check.

a× b c×d

a ×d a ×b

Figure 14.1
EXAMPLE 3. The positive integers Z+ form an ordered set with a smallest element. The order topology on Z+ is the discrete topology, for every one-point set is open: If n > 1, then the one-point set {n} = (n − 1, n + 1) is a basis element; and if n = 1, the one-point set {1} = [1, 2) is a basis element.
EXAMPLE 4. The set X = {1, 2} × Z+ in the dictionary order is another example of an ordered set with a smallest element. Denoting 1 × n by an and 2 × n by bn, we can represent X by
a1, a2, . . . ; b1, b2, . . . .
The order topology on X is not the discrete topology. Most one-point sets are open, but there is an exception—the one-point set {b1}. Any open set containing b1 must contain a basis element about b1 (by deﬁnition), and any basis element containing b1 contains points of the ai sequence.
Deﬁnition. If X is an ordered set, and a is an element of X , there are four subsets of X that are called the rays determined by a. They are the following:
(a, +∞) = {x | x > a}, (−∞, a) = {x | x < a}, [a, +∞) = {x | x ≥ a}, (−∞, a] = {x | x ≤ a}.

83

86 Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions

Ch. 2

Sets of the ﬁrst two types are called open rays, and sets of the last two types are called closed rays.
The use of the term “open” suggests that open rays in X are open sets in the order topology. And so they are. Consider, for example, the ray (a, +∞). If X has a largest element b0, then (a, +∞) equals the basis element (a, b0]. If X has no largest element, then (a, +∞) equals the union of all basis elements of the form (a, x), for x > a. In either case, (a, +∞) is open. A similar argument applies to the ray (−∞, a).
The open rays, in fact, form a subbasis for the order topology on X , as we now show. Because the open rays are open in the order topology, the topology they generate is contained in the order topology. On the other hand, every basis element for the order topology equals a ﬁnite intersection of open rays; the interval (a, b) equals the intersection of (−∞, b) and (a, +∞), while [a0, b) and (a, b0], if they exist, are themselves open rays. Hence the topology generated by the open rays contains the order topology.

§15 The Product Topology on X × Y
If X and Y are topological spaces, there is a standard way of deﬁning a topology on the cartesian product X × Y . We consider this topology now and study some of its properties.
Deﬁnition. Let X and Y be topological spaces. The product topology on X × Y is the topology having as basis the collection B of all sets of the form U × V , where U is an open subset of X and V is an open subset of Y .
Let us check that B is a basis. The ﬁrst condition is trivial, since X × Y is itself a basis element. The second condition is almost as easy, since the intersection of any two basis elements U1 × V1 and U2 × V2 is another basis element. For
(U1 × V1) ∩ (U2 × V2) = (U1 ∩ U2) × (V1 ∩ V2),
and the latter set is a basis element because U1 ∩ U2 and V1 ∩ V2 are open in X and Y , respectively. See Figure 15.1.
Note that the collection B is not a topology on X × Y . The union of the two rectangles pictured in Figure 15.1, for instance, is not a product of two sets, so it cannot belong to B; however, it is open in X × Y .
Each time we introduce a new concept, we shall try to relate it to the concepts that have been previously introduced. In the present case, we ask: What can one say if the topologies on X and Y are given by bases? The answer is as follows:
Theorem 15.1. If B is a basis for the topology of X and C is a basis for the topology of Y , then the collection
D = {B × C | B ∈ B and C ∈ C}
is a basis for the topology of X × Y .

84

Proof. We apply Lemma 13.2. Given an open set W of X × Y and a point x × y of W , by deﬁnition of the product topology there is a basis element U × V such that x × y ∈ U × V ⊂ W . Because B and C are bases for X and Y , respectively, we can choose an element B of B such that x ∈ B ⊂ U , and an element C of C such that y ∈ C ⊂ V . Then x × y ∈ B × C ⊂ W . Thus the collection D meets the criterion of Lemma 13.2, so D is a basis for X × Y .
EXAMPLE 1. We have a standard topology on R: the order topology. The product of this topology with itself is called the standard topology on R × R = R2. It has as basis the collection of all products of open sets of R, but the theorem just proved tells us that the much smaller collection of all products (a, b) × (c, d) of open intervals in R will also serve as a basis for the topology of R2. Each such set can be pictured as the interior of a rectangle in R2. Thus the standard topology on R2 is just the one we considered in Example 2 of §13.
It is sometimes useful to express the product topology in terms of a subbasis. To do this, we ﬁrst deﬁne certain functions called projections.
Deﬁnition. Let π1 : X × Y → X be deﬁned by the equation
π1(x, y) = x;
let π2 : X × Y → Y be deﬁned by the equation
π2(x, y) = y.
The maps π1 and π2 are called the projections of X × Y onto its ﬁrst and second factors, respectively.
We use the word “onto” because π1 and π2 are surjective (unless one of the spaces X or Y happens to be empty, in which case X × Y is empty and our whole discussion is empty as well!).
If U is an open subset of X , then the set π1−1(U ) is precisely the set U × Y , which is open in X × Y . Similarly, if V is open in Y , then
π2−1(V ) = X × V ,

85

which is also open in X × Y . The intersection of these two sets is the set U × V , as indicated in Figure 15.2. This fact leads to the following theorem:
Theorem 15.2. The collection = {π1−1(U ) | U open in X } ∪ {π2−1(V ) | V open in Y }
is a subbasis for the product topology on X × Y .

Proof. Let T denote the product topology on X × Y ; let T be the topology generated by . Because every element of belongs to T , so do arbitrary unions of ﬁnite intersections of elements of . Thus T ⊂ T . On the other hand, every basis element U × V for the topology T is a ﬁnite intersection of elements of , since
U × V = π1−1(U ) ∩ π2−1(V ). Therefore, U × V belongs to T , so that T ⊂ T as well.
§16 The Subspace Topology
Deﬁnition. Let X be a topological space with topology T . If Y is a subset of X , the collection
TY = {Y ∩ U | U ∈ T } is a topology on Y , called the subspace topology. With this topology, Y is called a subspace of X ; its open sets consist of all intersections of open sets of X with Y .

86

§16

The Subspace Topology

89

It is easy to see that TY is a topology. It contains ∅ and Y because

∅ = Y ∩ ∅ and Y = Y ∩ X,

where ∅ and X are elements of T . The fact that it is closed under ﬁnite intersections and arbitrary unions follows from the equations

(U1 ∩ Y ) ∩ · · · ∩ (Un ∩ Y ) = (U1 ∩ · · · ∩ Un) ∩ Y,

(Uα ∩ Y ) = ( Uα) ∩ Y.

Lemma 16.1. If B is a basis for the topology of X then the collection
BY = {B ∩ Y | B ∈ B}
is a basis for the subspace topology on Y . Proof. Given U open in X and given y ∈ U ∩ Y , we can choose an element B of B such that y ∈ B ⊂ U . Then y ∈ B ∩ Y ⊂ U ∩ Y . It follows from Lemma 13.2 that BY is a basis for the subspace topology on Y .

When dealing with a space X and a subspace Y , one needs to be careful when one uses the term “open set”. Does one mean an element of the topology of Y or an element of the topology of X ? We make the following deﬁnition : If Y is a subspace of X , we say that a set U is open in Y (or open relative to Y ) if it belongs to the topology of Y ; this implies in particular that it is a subset of Y . We say that U is open in X if it belongs to the topology of X .
There is a special situation in which every set open in Y is also open in X :

Lemma 16.2. Let Y be a subspace of X . If U is open in Y and Y is open in X , then U is open in X .
Proof. Since U is open in Y , U = Y ∩ V for some set V open in X . Since Y and V are both open in X , so is Y ∩ V .

Now let us explore the relation between the subspace topology and the order and product topologies. For product topologies, the result is what one might expect; for order topologies, it is not.

Theorem 16.3. If A is a subspace of X and B is a subspace of Y , then the product topology on A × B is the same as the topology A × B inherits as a subspace of X × Y .
Proof. The set U × V is the general basis element for X × Y , where U is open in X and V is open in Y . Therefore, (U × V ) ∩ (A × B) is the general basis element for the subspace topology on A × B. Now
(U × V ) ∩ (A × B) = (U ∩ A) × (V ∩ B).

Ch. 2

Since U ∩ A and V ∩ B are the general open sets for the subspace topologies on A and B, respectively, the set (U ∩ A) × (V ∩ B) is the general basis element for the product topology on A × B.
The conclusion we draw is that the bases for the subspace topology on A × B and for the product topology on A × B are the same. Hence the topologies are the same.

Now let X be an ordered set in the order topology, and let Y be a subset of X . The order relation on X , when restricted to Y , makes Y into an ordered set. However, the resulting order topology on Y need not be the same as the topology that Y inherits as a subspace of X . We give one example where the subspace and order topologies on Y agree, and two examples where they do not.

EXAMPLE 1. Consider the subset Y = [0, 1] of the real line R, in the subspace topology.

The subspace topology has as basis all sets of the form (a, b) ∩ Y , where (a, b) is an open

interval in R. Such a set is of one of the following types:

⎧

(a, b) ∩

Y

=

⎪⎪⎪⎨[(0a,,

b) b)

⎪⎪⎪⎩(Ya,o1r ]∅

if a and b are in Y , if only b is in Y , if only a is in Y , if neither a nor b is in Y .

By deﬁnition, each of these sets is open in Y . But sets of the second and third types are not open in the larger space R.
Note that these sets form a basis for the order topology on Y . Thus, we see that in the case of the set Y = [0, 1], its subspace topology (as a subspace of R) and its order topology are the same.

EXAMPLE 2. Let Y be the subset [0, 1) ∪ {2} of R. In the subspace topology on Y the

one-point

set

{2}

is

open,

because

it

is

the

intersection

of

the

open

set

(

3 2

,

5 2

)

with

Y

.

But

in

the order topology on Y , the set {2} is not open. Any basis element for the order topology

on Y that contains 2 is of the form

{x | x ∈ Y and a < x ≤ 2}

for some a ∈ Y ; such a set necessarily contains points of Y less than 2.

EXAMPLE 3. Let I = [0, 1]. The dictionary order on I × I is just the restriction to I × I of the dictionary order on the plane R × R. However, the dictionary order topology on I × I is not the same as the subspace topology on I × I obtained from the dictionary order topology on R × R! For example, the set {1/2} × (1/2, 1] is open in I × I in the subspace topology, but not in the order topology, as you can check. See Figure 16.1.
The set I × I in the dictionary order topology will be called the ordered square, and denoted by Io2.
The anomaly illustrated in Examples 2 and 3 does not occur for intervals or rays
in an ordered set X . This we now prove.
Given an ordered set X , let us say that a subset Y of X is convex in X if for each pair of points a < b of Y , the entire interval (a, b) of points of X lies in Y . Note that intervals and rays in X are convex in X .

Theorem 16.4. Let X be an ordered set in the order topology; let Y be a subset of X that is convex in X . Then the order topology on Y is the same as the topology Y inherits as a subspace of X .
Proof. Consider the ray (a, +∞) in X . What is its intersection with Y ? If a ∈ Y , then
(a, +∞) ∩ Y = {x | x ∈ Y and x > a};
this is an open ray of the ordered set Y . If a ∈/ Y , then a is either a lower bound on Y or an upper bound on Y , since Y is convex. In the former case, the set (a, +∞) ∩ Y equals all of Y ; in the latter case, it is empty.
A similar remark shows that the intersection of the ray (−∞, a) with Y is either an open ray of Y , or Y itself, or empty. Since the sets (a, +∞) ∩ Y and (−∞, a) ∩ Y form a subbasis for the subspace topology on Y , and since each is open in the order topology, the order topology contains the subspace topology.
To prove the reverse, note that any open ray of Y equals the intersection of an open ray of X with Y , so it is open in the subspace topology on Y . Since the open rays of Y are a subbasis for the order topology on Y , this topology is contained in the subspace topology.
To avoid ambiguity, let us agree that whenever X is an ordered set in the order topology and Y is a subset of X , we shall assume that Y is given the subspace topology unless we speciﬁcally state otherwise. If Y is convex in X , this is the same as the order topology on Y ; otherwise, it may not be.

§17 Closed Sets and Limit Points
Now that we have a few examples at hand, we can introduce some of the basic concepts associated with topological spaces. In this section, we treat the notions of closed set,

90

§17

Closed Sets and Limit Points

93

closure of a set, and limit point. These lead naturally to consideration of a certain axiom for topological spaces called the Hausdorff axiom.

Closed Sets A subset A of a topological space X is said to be closed if the set X − A is open.
EXAMPLE 1. The subset [a, b] of R is closed because its complement
R − [a, b] = (−∞, a) ∪ (b, +∞),
is open. Similarly, [a, +∞) is closed, because its complement (−∞, a) is open. These facts justify our use of the terms “closed interval” and “closed ray.” The subset [a, b) of R is neither open nor closed.

EXAMPLE 2. In the plane R2, the set {x × y | x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0}
is closed, because its complement is the union of the two sets (−∞, 0) × R and R × (−∞, 0),
each of which is a product of open sets of R and is, therefore, open in R2.

EXAMPLE 3. In the ﬁnite complement topology on a set X , the closed sets consist of X itself and all ﬁnite subsets of X .

EXAMPLE 4. In the discrete topology on the set X , every set is open; it follows that every set is closed as well.

EXAMPLE 5. Consider the following subset of the real line:

Y = [0, 1] ∪ (2, 3),

in the subspace topology. In this space, the set [0, 1] is open, since it is the intersection of

the

open

set

(−

1 2

,

3 2

)

of

R

with

Y

.

Similarly,

(2,

3)

is

open

as

a

subset

of

Y

;

it

is

even

open

as a subset of R. Since [0, 1] and (2, 3) are complements in Y of each other, we conclude

that both [0, 1] and (2, 3) are closed as subsets of Y .

These examples suggest that an answer to the mathematician’s riddle: “How is a set different from a door?” should be: “A door must be either open or closed, and cannot be both, while a set can be open, or closed, or both, or neither!”
The collection of closed subsets of a space X has properties similar to those satisﬁed by the collection of open subsets of X :

Theorem 17.1. Let X be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold: (1) ∅ and X are closed. (2) Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed. (3) Finite unions of closed sets are closed.

Proof. (1) ∅ and X are closed because they are the complements of the open sets X and ∅, respectively.
(2) Given a collection of closed sets { Aα}α∈J , we apply DeMorgan’s law,

X − Aα = (X − Aα).

α∈J

α∈J

Since the sets X − Aα are open by deﬁnition, the right side of this equation represents
an arbitrary union of open sets, and is thus open. Therefore, Aα is closed. (3) Similarly, if Ai is closed for i = 1, . . . , n, consider the equation

n

n

X − Ai = (X − Ai ).

i =1

i =1

The set on the right side of this equation is a ﬁnite intersection of open sets and is therefore open. Hence Ai is closed.

Instead of using open sets, one could just as well specify a topology on a space by giving a collection of sets (to be called “closed sets”) satisfying the three properties of this theorem. One could then deﬁne open sets as the complements of closed sets and proceed just as before. This procedure has no particular advantage over the one we have adopted, and most mathematicians prefer to use open sets to deﬁne topologies.
Now when dealing with subspaces, one needs to be careful in using the term “closed set.” If Y is a subspace of X , we say that a set A is closed in Y if A is a subset of Y and if A is closed in the subspace topology of Y (that is, if Y − A is open in Y ). We have the following theorem:

Theorem 17.2. Let Y be a subspace of X . Then a set A is closed in Y if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of X with Y .
Proof. Assume that A = C ∩ Y , where C is closed in X . (See Figure 17.1.) Then X − C is open in X , so that (X − C) ∩ Y is open in Y , by deﬁnition of the subspace topology. But (X − C) ∩ Y = Y − A. Hence Y − A is open in Y , so that A is closed in Y . Conversely, assume that A is closed in Y . (See Figure 17.2.) Then Y − A is open in Y , so that by deﬁnition it equals the intersection of an open set U of X with Y . The set X − U is closed in X , and A = Y ∩ (X − U ), so that A equals the intersection of a closed set of X with Y , as desired.

A set A that is closed in the subspace Y may or may not be closed in the larger space X . As was the case with open sets, there is a criterion for A to be closed in X ; we leave the proof to you:

Theorem 17.3. Let Y be a subspace of X . If A is closed in Y and Y is closed in X , then A is closed in X .

Closure and Interior of a Set
Given a subset A of a topological space X , the interior of A is deﬁned as the union of all open sets contained in A, and the closure of A is deﬁned as the intersection of all closed sets containing A.
The interior of A is denoted by Int A and the closure of A is denoted by Cl A or by A¯. Obviously Int A is an open set and A¯ is a closed set; furthermore,
Int A ⊂ A ⊂ A¯.
If A is open, A = Int A; while if A is closed, A = A¯. We shall not make much use of the interior of a set, but the closure of a set will be
quite important. When dealing with a topological space X and a subspace Y , one needs to exercise
care in taking closures of sets. If A is a subset of Y , the closure of A in Y and the closure of A in X will in general be different. In such a situation, we reserve the notation A¯ to stand for the closure of A in X . The closure of A in Y can be expressed in terms of A¯, as the following theorem shows:
Theorem 17.4. Let Y be a subspace of X ; let A be a subset of Y ; let A¯ denote the closure of A in X . Then the closure of A in Y equals A¯ ∩ Y .
Proof. Let B denote the closure of A in Y . The set A¯ is closed in X , so A¯ ∩ Y is closed in Y by Theorem 17.2. Since A¯ ∩Y contains A, and since by deﬁnition B equals the intersection of all closed subsets of Y containing A, we must have B ⊂ (A¯ ∩ Y ).
On the other hand, we know that B is closed in Y . Hence by Theorem 17.2, B = C ∩ Y for some set C closed in X . Then C is a closed set of X containing A; because A¯ is the intersection of all such closed sets, we conclude that A¯ ⊂ C. Then (A¯ ∩ Y ) ⊂ (C ∩ Y ) = B.

Ch. 2

The deﬁnition of the closure of a set does not give us a convenient way for actually ﬁnding the closures of speciﬁc sets, since the collection of all closed sets in X , like the collection of all open sets, is usually much too big to work with. Another way of describing the closure of a set, useful because it involves only a basis for the topology of X , is given in the following theorem.
First let us introduce some convenient terminology. We shall say that a set A intersects a set B if the intersection A ∩ B is not empty.
Theorem 17.5. Let A be a subset of the topological space X . (a) Then x ∈ A¯ if and only if every open set U containing x intersects A. (b) Supposing the topology of X is given by a basis, then x ∈ A¯ if and only if every basis element B containing x intersects A.
Proof. Consider the statement in (a). It is a statement of the form P ⇔ Q. Let us transform each implication to its contrapositive, thereby obtaining the logically equivalent statement (not P) ⇔ (not Q). Written out, it is the following:
x ∈/ A¯ ⇐⇒ there exists an open set U containing x that does not intersect A. In this form, our theorem is easy to prove. If x is not in A¯, the set U = X − A¯ is an open set containing x that does not intersect A, as desired. Conversely, if there exists an open set U containing x which does not intersect A, then X − U is a closed set containing A. By deﬁnition of the closure A¯, the set X − U must contain A¯; therefore, x cannot be in A¯. Statement (b) follows readily. If every open set containing x intersects A, so does every basis element B containing x, because B is an open set. Conversely, if every basis element containing x intersects A, so does every open set U containing x, because U contains a basis element that contains x.
Mathematicians often use some special terminology here. They shorten the statement “U is an open set containing x” to the phrase
“U is a neighborhood of x.”
Using this terminology, one can write the ﬁrst half of the preceding theorem as follows:
If A is a subset of the topological space X , then x ∈ A¯ if and only if every neighborhood of x intersects A.
EXAMPLE 6. Let X be the real line R. If A = (0, 1], then A¯ = [0, 1], for every neighborhood of 0 intersects A, while every point outside [0, 1] has a neighborhood disjoint from A. Similar arguments apply to the following subsets of X :
If B = {1/n | n ∈ Z+}, then B¯ = {0} ∪ B. If C = {0} ∪ (1, 2), then C¯ = {0} ∪ [1, 2]. If Q is the set of rational numbers, then Q¯ = R. If Z+ is the set of positive integers, then Z¯ + = Z+. If R+ is the set of positive reals, then the closure of R+ is the set R+ ∪ {0}. (This is the reason we introduced the notation R¯ + for the set R+ ∪ {0}, back in §2.)

Some mathematicians use the term “neighborhood” differently. They say that A is a neighborhood of x if A merely contains an open set containing x. We shall not follow this practice.

Limit Points

There is yet another way of describing the closure of a set, a way that involves the important concept of limit point, which we consider now.
If A is a subset of the topological space X and if x is a point of X , we say that x is a limit point (or “cluster point,” or “point of accumulation”) of A if every neighborhood of x intersects A in some point other than x itself. Said differently, x is a limit point of A if it belongs to the closure of A − {x}. The point x may lie in A or not; for this deﬁnition it does not matter.

EXAMPLE 8. Consider the real line R. If A = (0, 1], then the point 0 is a limit point

of

A

and

so

is

the

point

.

In

fact,

every

point

of

the

interval

[0,

1]

is

a

limit

point

of

A,

but

no other point of R is a limit point of A.

If B = {1/n | n ∈ Z+}, then 0 is the only limit point of B. Every other point x of R has

a neighborhood that either does not intersect B at all, or it intersects B only in the point x

itself. If C = {0} ∪ (1, 2), then the limit points of C are the points of the interval [1, 2]. If

Q is the set of rational numbers, every point of R is a limit point of Q. If Z+ is the set of positive integers, no point of R is a limit point of Z+. If R+ is the set of positive reals, then every point of {0} ∪ R+ is a limit point of R+.

Comparison of Examples 6 and 8 suggests a relationship between the closure of a set and the limit points of a set. That relationship is given in the following theorem:

Theorem 17.6. Let A be a subset of the topological space X ; let A be the set of all limit points of A. Then
A¯ = A ∪ A .
Proof. If x is in A , every neighborhood of x intersects A (in a point different from x). Therefore, by Theorem 17.5, x belongs to A¯. Hence A ⊂ A¯. Since by deﬁnition A ⊂ A¯, it follows that A ∪ A ⊂ A¯.
To demonstrate the reverse inclusion, we let x be a point of A¯ and show that x ∈ A ∪ A . If x happens to lie in A, it is trivial that x ∈ A ∪ A ; suppose that x does not lie in A. Since x ∈ A¯, we know that every neighborhood U of x intersects A; because x ∈/ A, the set U must intersect A in a point different from x. Then x ∈ A , so that x ∈ A ∪ A , as desired.

Ch. 2

Corollary 17.7. A subset of a topological space is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points.
Proof. The set A is closed if and only if A = A¯, and the latter holds if and only if A ⊂ A.

Hausdorff Spaces
One’s experience with open and closed sets and limit points in the real line and the plane can be misleading when one considers more general topological spaces. For example, in the spaces R and R2, each one-point set {x0} closed. This fact is easily proved; every point different from x0 has a neighborhood not intersecting {x0}, so that {x0} is its own closure. But this fact is not true for arbitrary topological spaces. Consider the topology on the three-point set {a, b, c} indicated in Figure 17.3. In this space, the one-point set {b} is not closed, for its complement is not open.

a bc
Figure 17.3
Similarly, one’s experience with the properties of convergent sequences in R and R2 can be misleading when one deals with more general topological spaces. In an arbitrary topological space, one says that a sequence x1, x2, . . . of points of the space X converges to the point x of X provided that, corresponding to each neighborhood U of x, there is a positive integer N such that xn ∈ U for all n ≥ N . In R and R2, a sequence cannot converge to more than one point, but in an arbitrary space, it can. In the space indicated in Figure 17.3, for example, the sequence deﬁned by setting xn = b for all n converges not only to the point b, but also to the point a and to the point c!
Topologies in which one-point sets are not closed, or in which sequences can converge to more than one point, are considered by many mathematicians to be somewhat strange. They are not really very interesting, for they seldom occur in other branches of mathematics. And the theorems that one can prove about topological spaces are rather limited if such examples are allowed. Therefore, one often imposes an additional condition that will rule out examples like this one, bringing the class of spaces under consideration closer to those to which one’s geometric intuition applies. The condition was suggested by the mathematician Felix Hausdorff, so mathematicians have come to call it by his name.
Deﬁnition. A topological space X is called a Hausdorff space if for each pair x1, x2 of distinct points of X , there exist neighborhoods U1, and U2 of x1 and x2, respectively, that are disjoint.

96

§17

Closed Sets and Limit Points

99

Theorem 17.8. Every ﬁnite point set in a Hausdorff space X is closed.
Proof. It sufﬁces to show that every one-point set {x0} is closed. If x is a point of X different from x0, then x and x0 have disjoint neighborhoods U and V , respectively. Since U does not intersect {x0}, the point x cannot belong to the closure of the set {x0}. As a result, the closure of the set {x0} is {x0} itself, so that it is closed.
The condition that ﬁnite point sets be closed is in fact weaker than the Hausdorff condition. For example, the real line R in the ﬁnite complement topology is not a Hausdorff space, but it is a space in which ﬁnite point sets are closed. The condition that ﬁnite point sets be closed has been given a name of its own: it is called the T1 axiom. (We shall explain the reason for this strange terminology in Chapter 4.) The T1 axiom will appear in this book in a few exercises, and in just one theorem, which is the following:
Theorem 17.9. Let X be a space satisfying the T1 axiom; let A be a subset of X . Then the point x is a limit point of A if and only if every neighborhood of x contains inﬁnitely many points of A.
Proof. If every neighborhood of x intersects A in inﬁnitely many points, it certainly intersects A in some point other than x itself, so that x is a limit point of A.
Conversely, suppose that x is a limit point of A, and suppose some neighborhood U of x intersects A in only ﬁnitely many points. Then U also intersects A − {x} in ﬁnitely many points; let {x1, . . . , xm} be the points of U ∩ (A − {x}). The set X − {x1, . . . , xm} is an open set of X , since the ﬁnite point set {x1, . . . , xm} is closed; then
U ∩ (X − {x1, . . . , xm})
is a neighborhood of x that intersects the set A − {x} not at all. This contradicts the assumption that x is a limit point of A.
One reason for our lack of interest in the T1 axiom is the fact that many of the interesting theorems of topology require not just that axiom, but the full strength of the Hausdorff axiom. Furthermore, most of the spaces that are important to mathematicians are Hausdorff spaces. The following two theorems give some substance to these remarks.
Theorem 17.10. If X is a Hausdorff space, then a sequence of points of X converges to at most one point of X .
Proof. Suppose that xn is a sequence of points of X that converges to x. If y = x, let U and V be disjoint neighborhoods of x and y, respectively. Since U contains xn for all but ﬁnitely many values of n, the set V cannot. Therefore, xn cannot converge to y.
