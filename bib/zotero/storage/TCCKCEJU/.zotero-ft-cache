Abstract:
In this paper, a monocular vision based autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance system for a commercial quadrotor is presented. The video stream of the front camera and the navigation data measured by the drone is sent to the ground station laptop via wireless connection. Received data processed by the vision based ORB-SLAM to compute the 3D position of the robot and the environment 3D sparse map in the form of point cloud. An algorithm is proposed for enrichment of the reconstructed map, and furthermore, a Kalman Filter is used for sensor fusion. The scaling factor of the monocular slam is calculated by the linear fitting. Moreover, a PID controller is designed for 3D position control. Finally, by means of the potential field method and Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planning algorithm, a collision-free road map is generated. Moreover, experimental verifications of the proposed algorithms are reported.
