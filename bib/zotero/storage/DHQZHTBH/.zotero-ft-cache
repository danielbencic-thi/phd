Topological complexity of collision free motion planning algorithms in the presence of multiple moving obstacles
Michael Farber, Mark Grant, and Sergey Yuzvinsky
Abstract. We study motion planning algorithms for collision free control of multiple objects in the presence of moving obstacles. We compute the topological complexity of algorithms solving this problem. We apply topological tools and use information about cohomology algebras of conﬁguration spaces. The results of the paper may potentially be used in systems of automatic traﬃc control.
1. Introduction
The theory of robot motion planning [11], [10] has developed a broad variety of algorithms designed for diﬀerent real life situations. Most of these algorithms assume that the robot performs an online search of the scene and eventually ﬁnds its way to the goal. In this approach one understands that the robot has initially a very limited knowledge of the scene and supplements this knowledge by using sensors, vision, memory and perhaps some ability to analyze these data.
A completely diﬀerent situation arises when one controls simultaneously multiple objects (robots) moving in a coordinated way in a fully known environment. Assume, for instance, that we have n objects moving in R3 with no collisions and avoiding the obstacles whose geometry is prescribed in advance. In this case the dimension 3n of the conﬁguration space of the system is large (if the number n of controlled objects is large) and therefore the online search algorithms as described above become much less eﬀective.
The topological approach to the robot motion planning problem initiated in [1, 2] is applicable in some situations with high dimensional conﬁguration space under the assumption that the conﬁguration space of the system is known in advance. One divides the whole conﬁguration space into pieces (local domains) and prescribes continuous motions (local rules) over each of the local domains. The minimal number of such local domains is the measure of topological complexity of the problem.
Formally, the topological complexity is a numerical invariant TC(X) of the conﬁguration space of the system [1]. Its introduction was inspired by the earlier well-known work of S. Smale [16] and V. Vassiliev [17] on the theory of topological

complexity of algorithms of solving polynomial equations. The approach of [1, 2] was also based on the general theory of robot motion planning algorithms described in the book of J.-C. Latombe [11] and on the abstract theory of a genus of a ﬁber space developed by A.S. Schwarz [14]. Paper [6] contains a recent survey.
Paper [5] solves the problem of ﬁnding the topological complexity of motion planning algorithms for controlling many particles moving in R3 or on the plane R2 with no collisions. Such motion planning algorithms appear in automatic traﬃc control problems. Paper [5] uses the techniques of the theory of subspace arrangements [12]. It was shown in [5] that the complexity is roughly twice the number of particles (it is 2n − 2 for the planar case and 2n − 1 for the spatial case). At the moment we do not know speciﬁc motion planning algorithms with complexity linear in n. However a quadratic in n motion planning algorithm was described in §26 of [6].
In paper [3] we studied the problem of computing the topological complexity of the motion planning problem for n particles moving on a graph with forbidden collisions. It was shown that for large numbers of particles the topological complexity depends only on the geometry of the graph and is independent of the number of particles. Some speciﬁc motion planning algorithms for this problem were also constructed [3].
In the present paper we study algorithms solving the following motion planning problem. Several objects are to be transported from an initial conﬁguration A1, A2, . . . , An ∈ R3 to a ﬁnal conﬁguration B1, B2, . . . , Bn ∈ R3 such that in the process of motion there occur no collision between the objects and such that the objects do not touch the obstacles in the process of motion.
We make several simplifying assumptions: (a) Each object is represented by a single point; (b) each obstacle is represented by a single point; (c) collision between two objects occurs if they are situated at the same point in space; (d) an object touches an obstacle if the points representing the object and the obstacle coincide. We also make an important assumption that the behavior of the obstacles is known in advance. We show that because of this assumption the problem becomes topologically equivalent to the similar problem when the obstacles are stationary.
One of our results seems surprising: we show that complexity of collision free navigation of many objects in the presence of moving obstacles is essentially independent of the number of obstacles and grows linearly with the number of controlled objects.
We believe that the conclusions of this paper will remain valid in a more general and realistic situation when the objects and the obstacles are represented by small balls, possibly of diﬀerent radii, and the control requirements are to avoid tangencies between objects and obstacles.

2. Statement of the result
Let us explain our notation. n denotes the number of moving objects and m the number of obstacles. The symbol F (X, n) denotes the conﬁguration space of n distinct points in a topological space X; in other words, F (X, n) is the subset of the Cartesian power X × X × · · · × X (n times) consisting of conﬁgurations (x1, . . . , xn) (where xi ∈ X) with xi = xj for i = j.
We assume that the controllable objects lie in Rr+1 where r ≥ 1 is an integer. Clearly, the practical applications are covered by the cases r = 1 or r = 2 which

MOVING OBSTACLES

will be considered in more detail later. In this section we will assume that r is arbitrary.
The algorithms we study take as input the following data:
(a) the initial conﬁguration A = (A1, A2, . . . , An) ∈ F (Rr+1, n) of the objects, Ai ∈ Rr+1, with Ai = Aj ;
(b) the desired ﬁnal conﬁguration of the objects B = (B1, B2, . . . , Bn) ∈ F (Rr+1, n), where Bi ∈ Rr+1, Bi = Bj ;
(c) the trajectory of moving obstacles C(t) = (C1(t), C2(t), . . . , Cm(t)) ∈ F (Rr+1, m), Ci(t) = Cj(t) for any t ∈ [0, 1].
Here t ∈ [0, 1] is the time. We assume that Ai = Cj(0) and Bi = Cj(1) for all i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , m. This means that initially the objects are all distinct and disjoint from the obstacles at time t = 0 and the desired positions of the objects are pairwise distinct and distinct from positions of the obstacles at time t = 1.
The output of the algorithm is a continuous motion of the objects

γi(t) ∈ Rr+1, t ∈ [0, 1], i = 1, . . . , n

satisfying the following conditions:

(α) γi(t) are continuous functions of t; (β) γi(0) = Ai and γi(1) = Bi; (γ) for any t ∈ [0, 1] one has γi(t) = γk(t) for i = k where i, k ∈ {1, . . . , n}; (δ) for any t ∈ [0, 1] one has γi(t) = Cj(t) where i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , m.

Let the function

Ym : [0, 1] → F (Rr+1, m)

represent the motion of the obstacles. For any time t ∈ [0, 1] the obstacles are positioned at the points

Ym(t) = (C1(t), C2(t), . . . , Cm(t)). Next we introduce a few more notations:

E(Ym) = {γ : [0, 1] → F (Rr+1, n); γ(t) ∩ Ym(t) = ∅, ∀t ∈ [0, 1]},

B(Ym) = {(A, B) ∈ F (Rr+1, n) × F (Rr+1, n); A ∩ Ym(0) = ∅, B ∩ Ym(1) = ∅}.

Elements of E(Ym) are motions of the objects avoiding the obstacles, elements of B(Ym) represent the input data: the initial conﬁguration A and the desired conﬁguration B.
There is a canonical map

(2.1)

π(Ym) : E(Ym) → B(Ym)

given by π(Ym)(γ) = (γ(0), γ(1)). A section of π is a map (possibly discontinuous)

(2.2)

s : B(Ym) → E(Ym),

satisfying π(Ym) ◦ s = 1B(Ym). Clearly, s assigns to any input data (A, B) ∈ B(Ym) a motion of the controllable objects starting at conﬁguration A, ending at B and avoiding mutual collisions between objects and between objects and the moving obstacles. We conclude that algorithms solving our motion planning problem are in one-to-one correspondence with sections of map (2.1) (we will see below that it

is a ﬁbration). Given a section s as above, then for any pair (A, B) ∈ B(Ym), the output of the algorithm is s(A, B) ∈ E(Ym).
Hence, our task is to estimate the complexity of ﬁnding a section of π(Ym). We recall that the Schwarz genus [14] of a continuous map f : X → Y map is the minimal integer k such that Y can be covered by k open sets U1∪U2 · · ·∪Uk = Y with the property that over each Ui there exists a continuous section si : Ui → X, f ◦ si = 1Ui . We apply this notion to estimate the complexity of ﬁnding a section to (2.1).
Definition 2.1. The complexity of the motion planning problem for moving n objects in the presence of m moving obstacles is deﬁned as the Schwarz genus of map (2.1).
In practical terms this means the following. One divides the space of all possible inputs B(Ym) into several domains (called the local domains) and speciﬁes a continuous motion planning algorithm (called a local rule) over each of the domains. The complexity of the problem is deﬁned (according to Deﬁnition 2.1) as the minimal number of local domains in all possible algorithms of this type.
Now we state our main result:
Theorem 2.2. The complexity of motion planning problem of moving n ≥ 2 objects in R3 avoiding collisions in the presence of m ≥ 1 moving obstacles equals 2n + 1. The complexity of the similar planar problem (i.e. when the objects are restricted to lie in the plane R2) is 2n if m = 1 and it is 2n + 1 for m ≥ 2.
This theorem follows by combining Theorem 3.1 and Theorems 5.1 and 6.1 which are stated and proven below.

3. Reduction to the case of stationary obstacles

The following theorem shows that Deﬁnition 2.1 gives the notion of complexity which coincides with a special case of the notion of navigational complexity of topological spaces TC(X) which was studied previously [1]. Recall that TC(X) denotes the Schwarz genus of the path space ﬁbration

(3.1)

π : XI → X × X

where XI denotes the space of all continuous paths γ : I = [0, 1] → X with the compact-open topology and π(γ) = (γ(0), γ(1)).

Theorem 3.1. (a) The map π(Ym) (given by (2.1)) is a locally trivial ﬁbration;

(b) The ﬁberwise homeomorphism type of ﬁbration π(Ym) is independent of the

trajectory of moving obstacles Ym; in particular, it equals the Schwarz genus of the

special case of (2.1) when the obstacles are stationary; (c) The Schwarz genus of

π(Ym) equals

TC(F (Rr+1 − Sm, n))

where Sm = {s1, . . . , sm} ⊂ Rr+1 is an arbitrary ﬁxed m-element subset.

Proof. First we ﬁnd a continuous family of homeomorphisms

ψt : Rr+1 → Rr+1, t ∈ [0, 1]

having the properties

(3.2)

ψ0 = id, and ψt(Ym(t)) = Ym(0), t ∈ [0, 1].

MOVING OBSTACLES

Equation (3.2) is understood as an equality between ordered sets; in other words, (3.2) states that

(3.3)

ψt(Ci(t)) = Ci(0), t ∈ [0, 1].

The existence of such isotopy ψt is a standard fact of the manifold topology; formally it follows from the well known isotopy extension theorem.
Next we consider the commutative diagram of continuous maps

E(Ym)

→F X I

(3.4)

↓ π(Ym)

↓π

B(Ym)

→G X × X

where X = F (Rr+1 − Ym(0), n)
and π is the canonical path space ﬁbration (3.1) for the special case X = F (Rr+1 − Ym(0), n). Maps F and G are deﬁned as follows:

(3.5)

F (γ)(t) = ψt(γ(t)), γ ∈ E(Ym), t ∈ [0, 1],

(3.6)

G(A, B) = (ψ0(A), ψ1(B)), (A, B) ∈ B(Ym).

Clearly, F and G are homeomorphisms and diagram (3.4) is commutative. This implies statements (a) - (c) of Theorem 3.1.

4. Cohomology of conﬁguration space F (Rr+1 − Sm, n)

In this section we collect some known topological results which will be used in
this paper. All cohomology groups have Z as coeﬃcients. Let Sm = {s1, . . . , sm} ⊂ Rr+1 be a ﬁxed sequence of m distinct points in
Euclidean space Rr+1. Here r ≥ 1 is an integer. The space F (Rr+1 − Sm, n) represents conﬁgurations of n particles in Rr+1 avoiding mutual collisions and collisions
with m stationary obstacles s1, . . . , sm. The theorems we state in this section are known, they can be found in Chapter
V of the book by Fadell and Husseini [7]; we have adjusted the notations as required for our needs. The space F (R2 − Sm, n) (here r = 1) can be identiﬁed with the complement of an arrangement of aﬃne hyperplanes in Cn, so one can also use the
book [12] as the reference. We begin by noting that F (Rr+1 − Sm, n) embeds in the conﬁguration space
F (Rr+1, n + m) via the map (y1, . . . , yn) → (y1, . . . , yn, s1, . . . , sm) (in fact this embeds F (Rr+1 − Sm, n) as the ﬁbre over (s1, . . . , sm) of the locally trivial ﬁbration F (Rr+1, n + m) → F (Rr+1, m) which projects to the last m points of the conﬁguration). The cohomology algebra H∗(F (Rr+1, n + m); Z) is well known, and can
be described as follows.
For each pair of integers i = j such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n + m, consider the map

φij : F (Rr+1, n + m) → Sr,

(y1, y2, . . . , yn+m) →

yi − yj |yi − yj|

∈

Sr.

Letting [Sr] ∈ Hr(Sr) denote the fundamental cohomology class of the sphere Sr, we obtain cohomology classes
eij = φ∗ij [Sr] ∈ Hr(F (Rr+1, n + m); Z).

Theorem 4.1. ([7], Theorem V.4.2) H∗(F (Rr+1, n+m)) is the free associative
graded-commutative algebra generated by the classes eij for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n + m,
subject to the relations (i) e2ij = 0, and (ii) eijeik = (eij − eik)ejk for any triple i < j < k.

Theorem 4.2. ([7], V.4.2) The homomorphism H∗(F (Rr+1, n + m); Z) → H∗(F (Rr+1 − Sm, n); Z)

induced by inclusion is an epimorphism, with kernel equal to the ideal generated by those eij having i > n and j > n.

Corollary 4.3. In H∗(F (Rr+1 − Sm, n); Z) there are relations eij eik = 0
for any triples i, j, k such that i ≤ n and j, k > n.

Theorem 4.4. ([7], Theorem V.4.3) A basis for H∗(F (Rr+1 − Sm, n); Z) is given by the set of monomials

ei1j1 ei2j2 . . . eisjs
where 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < is ≤ n and for each q with 1 ≤ q ≤ s we have iq < jq and 1 ≤ jq ≤ n + m.

We remark here that the maximum length of such a monomial is (n − 1) when m = 0, and n when m ≥ 1. Hence the highest dimension in which the integral cohomology of F (Rr+1 − Sm, n) is non-trivial is r(n − 1) when m = 0 and rn when m ≥ 1. Note also that when m > 1 the given basis includes all monomials of the
form

(4.1)

µI = ei,n+1 ei,n+2

i∈I

i∈I

for every I ⊂ {1, . . . , n}. For r = 1 this fact also follows from the notion of nbcbasis for an appropriate ordering of the generators (see [12]).
In what follows we will specialise to the cases r = 2 and r = 1.

5. Computing TC(F (R3 − Sm, n))

Theorem 5.1. One has: TC(F (R3 − Sm, n)) =

2n − 1 if m = 0, 2n + 1 if m ≥ 1.

Proof. We ﬁrst establish a lower bound. We shall use the cohomological lower

bound given by Theorem 7 of [1]. Set e¯ij = 1⊗eij −eij ⊗1. It is a zero-divisor of the

cohomology algebra. Note that (e¯ij )2 = −2(eij ⊗ eij) = 0. Consider the following

product π =

n−1 i=1

(e¯in

)2

.

We

ﬁnd

π

=

(−2)n−1µ

⊗

µ,

where

µ

=

n−1 i=1

ein.

The

monomial µ is nonzero by Theorem 4.4, and hence the product π of length 2(n − 1)

is nonzero. This gives the lower bound TC(F (R3 −Sm, n)) ≥ 2n−1. Now assuming

MOVING OBSTACLES

that m ≥ 1 we have a nontrivial product

n i=1

(e¯i(n+1) )2

of

length

2n,

which

gives

the lower bound TC(F (R3 − Sm, n)) ≥ 2n + 1 when m ≥ 1.

To obtain the upper bound, note that F (R3 − Sm, n) can be viewed as the

complement of a ﬁnite collection of codimension 3 aﬃne subspaces in R3n, so it is

simply-connected by an easy transversality argument. Since it has ﬁnitely generated

torsion-free homology and cohomology, it has the homotopy type of a CW-complex

consisting of one k-cell for each k-dimensional element in the basis for cohomology

given by Theorem 4.4 (see Chapter 4.C of [9]). This minimal cell structure is made

explicit in Theorem VI.8.2 of [7]. In particular, it has the homotopy type of a

polyhedron of dimension 2(n − 1) when m = 0 and 2n when m ≥ 1. We now apply

Corollary 5.3 of [2] stating that for a 1-connected polyhedron Y ,

TC(Y ) ≤ dim(Y ) + 1,

which together with homotopy invariance of TC completes the proof.

6. Computing TC(F (R2 − Sm, n))

Theorem 6.1. One has:

 2n − 2 if m = 0,



TC(F (R2 − Sm, n)) = 2n

if m = 1,

 2n + 1 if m ≥ 2.

Proof. The statement for the ﬁrst two cases follows immediately from [5] and the fact that F (R2 − X1, n) is homotopy equivalent to F (R2, n + 1) (see [7],p.15).
In what follows we assume that m ≥ 1. We ﬁrst establish a lower bound using
again the cohomological lower bound given by Theorem 7 from [1]. Set as above e¯ij = 1 ⊗ eij − eij ⊗ 1 and consider the product

π=

e¯ij .

i=1,...,n, j=n+1,n+2

It is clear that π can be expressed as a linear combination of pure tensors µ1 ⊗ µ2

where µi are monomials in the eij complementary to each other in π. Since the highest non-zero dimension in H∗(F (R2−Sm, n); Z) is n both µi should have degree

n in order for µ1 ⊗ µ2 not to vanish. Also it follows from the relation of Corollary

4.3 that the nonvanishing summands of monomial deﬁned by (4.1), I runs over

π are of the all subsets

form µI of {1, 2,

.⊗. .µ, nI¯,}wahnedreI¯µdI einsotthees

the complement of I. Since the set {µI|I ⊂ {1, . . . , n}} is a subset of a basis of Hn(F (R2 − Sm, n); Z) given by Theorem 4.4, no cancellations are possible, whence π = 0. This gives the inequality TC(F (R2 − Sm, n)) ≥ 2n + 1.

The opposite inequality follows immediately from Theorem 5.2 of [2] since

F (R2 − Sm, n) has the homotopy type of a connected polyhedron of dimension n

(see [12]). This completes the proof of the Theorem.

7. Concluding remarks
First we note that our main result Theorem 2.2 follows by simply combining Theorems 3.1, 5.1 and 6.1.
Let us compare the following two control problems: (1) motion planning for moving n objects in R3 with no collisions and avoiding collisions with m ≥ 1 moving obstacles; and (2) motion planning for moving n objects in R3 with the

only requirement that they avoid a single point obstacle (in particular, the objects are allowed to collide, i.e. to occupy the same position in space). Note that the integer m in problem (1) can be arbitrarily large. According to Theorem 2.2 the topological complexity of the problem (1) is 2n + 1. Surprisingly, problem (2) also has complexity 2n + 1. Indeed, the conﬁguration space of problem (2) is Cartesian power of n copies of R3 − {0} which is homotopy equivalent to
S2 × S2 × · · · × S2 (n times)
which has topological complexity 2n + 1 as it is easy to see. Hence, surprisingly problem (1) which is intuitively more “complicated” has the same topological complexity as problem (2).
This comparison shows that in general the notion of topological complexity is only a partial reﬂection of real diﬃculty of a motion planning problem.
