Topological Path Planning
In R2 - O:

goal We would like to be able to:
1. Make distinction between the different topological classes of trajectories.

2. Exploit that information for optimal trajectory planning in different topological classes.

3. Apply that to solving real

Non-intersecting rays.
h(ττ1) = “ b b-1 b a a-1 ” = “ b ” (reduced)

The words are complete homotopy invariants: Two trajectories are homotopic if and only if their reduced words are the same.
Why? Can we generalize?

h(ττ2) = “ a-1 b ” h(ττ3) = “ b a-1 ”

But before that, a few robotics applications for motivation…

Motivation: Application of Path Homotopy Invariants in Robotics

Can be used in breadth-first search algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's) for efficiently finding optimal paths in different homotopy classes (using a graph representation of the configuration space):

Proposition 1: If

then the “words” are complete path homotopy invariants.

Seifert – van Kampen Theorem:

j = 1, 2, ...,

•

•

is simply-connected.

o gives an open cover of X,

i = 1

o closed under intersection,

o any pair-wise intersection giving the simply-connected space, X0.

In ℝ3 - O

h(τγ) = “u2 u1-1 u2-1 ”

Proposition 1 holds
(words are complete homotopy invariants)
Can’t select such Ui’s if the obstacle is knotted/linked.

Knotted / Linked Obstacles
We still can choose co-dimension 1 manifolds, Ui’s, which intersect.
[Other choices, e.g., Seifert surfaces, violate properties (b) or (c), which make things more difficult!]
As a consequence, trivial loops can have non-empty words. e.g:
o Relation set, R: The set of all such words obtained from the intersections. o Symmetricized Relation set, R: All the words in R, their inverses and their cyclic permutations.
Siefert – van Kampen Theorem (a more general form): / N
/ N
where, N is the normal subgroup generated by the words corresponding to the trivial loops (including all their cyclic permutations and inverses).

Algorithm: Dehn’s Algorithm

for Word Problem

Problem: Given the symmetricized Relation set, R, Check if two paths, τ1 and τ2, connecting the same points, belong to the same homotopy class. [Equivalently, whether or not w := h(ττ1 U -τ2) N.]

Various algorithms exist, each with completeness & termination

guarantees only for specific classes of groups and presentations.

Dehn’s metric algorithm:

Ex.: Suppose w = h(ττ1 U -τ2) =

1. Cyclically reduce w.

2. For every ρ R, check if w and ρ share a

Until no subword of length < |ρ|/2. If yes,

further reduction

replace the subword in w with the

possible. smaller “equivalent”.

Assuming,

Properties:

,

Low computational complexity, always terminates, paths are homotopic

if terminates to empty word, but…

if it does not terminate to empty word, the paths are not necessarily

not homotopic (except under certain specific circumstances).

Algorithm: Use in Graph Search

Lets us compute optimal trajectories (in the discrete graph) in different homotopy classes using a single run of the search algorithm. Trajectories are generated in order of path length.

Need to carefully partition so that the partitions satisfy the conditions of Proposition 2. Also, need to find the corresponding relation set, R.

● Create lower-dimensional abstractions/equivalents of configuration spaces for reduction of computational complexity
● Compute solutions in distinct topological classes
