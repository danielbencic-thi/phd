Foreword
Beginning in the spring of 2000, a series of four one-semester courses were taught at Princeton University whose purpose was to present, in an integrated manner, the core areas of analysis. The objective was to make plain the organic unity that exists between the various parts of the subject, and to illustrate the wide applicability of ideas of analysis to other ﬁelds of mathematics and science. The present series of books is an elaboration of the lectures that were given.
While there are a number of excellent texts dealing with individual parts of what we cover, our exposition aims at a diﬀerent goal: presenting the various sub-areas of analysis not as separate disciplines, but rather as highly interconnected. It is our view that seeing these relations and their resulting synergies will motivate the reader to attain a better understanding of the subject as a whole. With this outcome in mind, we have concentrated on the main ideas and theorems that have shaped the ﬁeld (sometimes sacriﬁcing a more systematic approach), and we have been sensitive to the historical order in which the logic of the subject developed.
We have organized our exposition into four volumes, each reﬂecting the material covered in a semester. Their contents may be broadly summarized as follows:
I. Fourier series and integrals.
II. Complex analysis.
III. Measure theory, Lebesgue integration, and Hilbert spaces.
IV. A selection of further topics, including functional analysis, distributions, and elements of probability theory.
However, this listing does not by itself give a complete picture of the many interconnections that are presented, nor of the applications to other branches that are highlighted. To give a few examples: the elements of (ﬁnite) Fourier series studied in Book I, which lead to Dirichlet characters, and from there to the inﬁnitude of primes in an arithmetic progression; the X-ray and Radon transforms, which arise in a number of

problems in Book I, and reappear in Book III to play an important role in understanding Besicovitch-like sets in two and three dimensions; Fatou’s theorem, which guarantees the existence of boundary values of bounded holomorphic functions in the disc, and whose proof relies on ideas developed in each of the ﬁrst three books; and the theta function, which ﬁrst occurs in Book I in the solution of the heat equation, and is then used in Book II to ﬁnd the number of ways an integer can be represented as the sum of two or four squares, and in the analytic continuation of the zeta function.
A few further words about the books and the courses on which they were based. These courses where given at a rather intensive pace, with 48 lecture-hours a semester. The weekly problem sets played an indispensable part, and as a result exercises and problems have a similarly important role in our books. Each chapter has a series of “Exercises” that are tied directly to the text, and while some are easy, others may require more eﬀort. However, the substantial number of hints that are given should enable the reader to attack most exercises. There are also more involved and challenging “Problems”; the ones that are most diﬃcult, or go beyond the scope of the text, are marked with an asterisk.
Despite the substantial connections that exist between the diﬀerent volumes, enough overlapping material has been provided so that each of the ﬁrst three books requires only minimal prerequisites: acquaintance with elementary topics in analysis such as limits, series, diﬀerentiable functions, and Riemann integration, together with some exposure to linear algebra. This makes these books accessible to students interested in such diverse disciplines as mathematics, physics, engineering, and ﬁnance, at both the undergraduate and graduate level.

It is with great pleasure that we express our appreciation to all who have aided in this enterprise. We are particularly grateful to the students who participated in the four courses. Their continuing interest, enthusiasm, and dedication provided the encouragement that made this project possible. We also wish to thank Adrian Banner and Jose Luis Rodrigo for their special help in running the courses, and their eﬀorts to see that the students got the most from each class. In addition, Adrian Banner also made valuable suggestions that are incorporated in the text.

We wish also to record a note of special thanks for the following individuals: Charles Feﬀerman, who taught the ﬁrst week (successfully launching the whole project!); Paul Hagelstein, who in addition to reading part of the manuscript taught several weeks of one of the courses, and has since taken over the teaching of the second round of the series; and Daniel Levine, who gave valuable help in proof-reading. Last but not least, our thanks go to Gerree Pecht, for her consummate skill in typesetting and for the time and energy she spent in the preparation of all aspects of the lectures, such as transparencies, notes, and the manuscript.
We are also happy to acknowledge our indebtedness for the support we received from the 250th Anniversary Fund of Princeton University, and the National Science Foundation’s VIGRE program.

Introduction

... In eﬀect, if one extends these functions by allowing complex values for the arguments, then there arises a harmony and regularity which without it would remain hidden.
B. Riemann, 1851

When we begin the study of complex analysis we enter a marvelous world, full of wonderful insights. We are tempted to use the adjectives magical, or even miraculous when describing the ﬁrst theorems we learn; and in pursuing the subject, we continue to be astonished by the elegance and sweep of the results.
The starting point of our study is the idea of extending a function initially given for real values of the argument to one that is deﬁned when the argument is complex. Thus, here the central objects are functions from the complex plane to itself

f : C → C,

or more generally, complex-valued functions deﬁned on open subsets of C. At ﬁrst, one might object that nothing new is gained from this extension, since any complex number z can be written as z = x + iy where x, y ∈ R and z is identiﬁed with the point (x, y) in R2.
However, everything changes drastically if we make a natural, but misleadingly simple-looking assumption on f : that it is diﬀerentiable in the complex sense. This condition is called holomorphicity, and it shapes most of the theory discussed in this book.
A function f : C → C is holomorphic at the point z ∈ C if the limit

f (z + h) − f (z) lim

(h ∈ C)

h→0

h

exists. This is similar to the deﬁnition of diﬀerentiability in the case of a real argument, except that we allow h to take complex values. The reason this assumption is so far-reaching is that, in fact, it encompasses a multiplicity of conditions: so to speak, one for each angle that h can approach zero.

INTRODUCTION

Although one might now be tempted to prove theorems about holomorphic functions in terms of real variables, the reader will soon discover that complex analysis is a new subject, one which supplies proofs to the theorems that are proper to its own nature. In fact, the proofs of the main properties of holomorphic functions which we discuss in the next chapters are generally very short and quite illuminating.
The study of complex analysis proceeds along two paths that often intersect. In following the ﬁrst way, we seek to understand the universal characteristics of holomorphic functions, without special regard for speciﬁc examples. The second approach is the analysis of some particular functions that have proved to be of great interest in other areas of mathematics. Of course, we cannot go too far along either path without having traveled some way along the other. We shall start our study with some general characteristic properties of holomorphic functions, which are subsumed by three rather miraculous facts:
1. Contour integration: If f is holomorphic in Ω, then for appropriate closed paths in Ω

f (z)dz = 0.
γ
2. Regularity: If f is holomorphic, then f is indeﬁnitely diﬀerentiable.
3. Analytic continuation: If f and g are holomorphic functions in Ω which are equal in an arbitrarily small disc in Ω, then f = g everywhere in Ω.
These three phenomena and other general properties of holomorphic functions are treated in the beginning chapters of this book. Instead of trying to summarize the contents of the rest of this volume, we mention brieﬂy several other highlights of the subject.
• The zeta function, which is expressed as an inﬁnite series
∞1 ζ(s) = ns ,
n=1
and is initially deﬁned and holomorphic in the half-plane Re(s) > 1, where the convergence of the sum is guaranteed. This function and its variants (the L-series) are central in the theory of prime numbers, and have already appeared in Chapter 8 of Book I, where

we proved Dirichlet’s theorem. Here we will prove that ζ extends to a meromorphic function with a pole at s = 1. We shall see that the behavior of ζ(s) for Re(s) = 1 (and in particular that ζ does not vanish on that line) leads to a proof of the prime number theorem.

• The theta function

Θ(z|τ ) =

eπin2τ e2πinz ,

n=−∞

which in fact is a function of the two complex variables z and τ , holomorphic for all z, but only for τ in the half-plane Im(τ ) > 0. On the one hand, when we ﬁx τ , and think of Θ as a function of z, it is closely related to the theory of elliptic (doubly-periodic) functions. On the other hand, when z is ﬁxed, Θ displays features of a modular function in the upper half-plane. The function Θ(z|τ ) arose in Book I as a fundamental solution of the heat equation on the circle. It will be used again in the study of the zeta function, as well as in the proof of certain results in combinatorics and number theory given in Chapters 6 and 10.

Two additional noteworthy topics that we treat are: the Fourier transform with its elegant connection to complex analysis via contour integration, and the resulting applications of the Poisson summation formula; also conformal mappings, with the mappings of polygons whose inverses are realized by the Schwarz-Christoﬀel formula, and the particular case of the rectangle, which leads to elliptic integrals and elliptic functions.

1 Preliminaries to Complex Analysis
The sweeping development of mathematics during the last two centuries is due in large part to the introduction of complex numbers; paradoxically, this is based on the seemingly absurd notion that there are numbers whose squares are negative.
E. Borel, 1952
This chapter is devoted to the exposition of basic preliminary material which we use extensively throughout of this book.
We begin with a quick review of the algebraic and analytic properties of complex numbers followed by some topological notions of sets in the complex plane. (See also the exercises at the end of Chapter 1 in Book I.)
Then, we deﬁne precisely the key notion of holomorphicity, which is the complex analytic version of diﬀerentiability. This allows us to discuss the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and power series.
Finally, we deﬁne the notion of a curve and the integral of a function along it. In particular, we shall prove an important result, which we state loosely as follows: if a function f has a primitive, in the sense that there exists a function F that is holomorphic and whose derivative is precisely f , then for any closed curve γ
f (z) dz = 0.
γ
This is the ﬁrst step towards Cauchy’s theorem, which plays a central role in complex function theory.
1 Complex numbers and the complex plane
Many of the facts covered in this section were already used in Book I.
1.1 Basic properties A complex number takes the form z = x + iy where x and y are real, and i is an imaginary number that satisﬁes i2 = −1. We call x and y the

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

real part and the imaginary part of z, respectively, and we write
x = Re(z) and y = Im(z).
The real numbers are precisely those complex numbers with zero imaginary parts. A complex number with zero real part is said to be purely imaginary.
Throughout our presentation, the set of all complex numbers is denoted by C. The complex numbers can be visualized as the usual Euclidean plane by the following simple identiﬁcation: the complex number z = x + iy ∈ C is identiﬁed with the point (x, y) ∈ R2. For example, 0 corresponds to the origin and i corresponds to (0, 1). Naturally, the x and y axis of R2 are called the real axis and imaginary axis, because they correspond to the real and purely imaginary numbers, respectively. (See Figure 1.)

The natural rules for adding and multiplying complex numbers can be obtained simply by treating all numbers as if they were real, and keeping in mind that i2 = −1. If z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2, then
z1 + z2 = (x1 + x2) + i(y1 + y2), and also
z1z2 = (x1 + iy1)(x2 + iy2) = x1x2 + ix1y2 + iy1x2 + i2y1y2 = (x1x2 − y1y2) + i(x1y2 + y1x2).

If we take the two expressions above as the deﬁnitions of addition and multiplication, it is a simple matter to verify the following desirable properties:
• Commutativity: z1 + z2 = z2 + z1 and z1z2 = z2z1 for all z1, z2 ∈ C.
• Associativity: (z1 + z2) + z3 = z1 + (z2 + z3); and (z1z2)z3 = z1(z2z3) for z1, z2, z3 ∈ C.
• Distributivity: z1(z2 + z3) = z1z2 + z1z3 for all z1, z2, z3 ∈ C.
Of course, addition of complex numbers corresponds to addition of the corresponding vectors in the plane R2. Multiplication, however, consists of a rotation composed with a dilation, a fact that will become transparent once we have introduced the polar form of a complex number. At present we observe that multiplication by i corresponds to a rotation by an angle of π/2.
The notion of length, or absolute value of a complex number is identical to the notion of Euclidean length in R2. More precisely, we deﬁne the absolute value of a complex number z = x + iy by

|z| = (x2 + y2)1/2,

so that |z| is precisely the distance from the origin to the point (x, y). In particular, the triangle inequality holds:

|z + w| ≤ |z| + |w| for all z, w ∈ C.

We record here other useful inequalities. For all z ∈ C we have both |Re(z)| ≤ |z| and |Im(z)| ≤ |z|, and for all z, w ∈ C

||z| − |w|| ≤ |z − w|.

This follows from the triangle inequality since

|z| ≤ |z − w| + |w| and |w| ≤ |z − w| + |z|.

The complex conjugate of z = x + iy is deﬁned by

z = x − iy,

and it is obtained by a reﬂection across the real axis in the plane. In fact a complex number z is real if and only if z = z, and it is purely imaginary if and only if z = −z.

Also, one has

|z|2 = zz

and as a consequence

1z z = |z|2 whenever z = 0.

Any non-zero complex number z can be written in polar form

z = reiθ ,

where r > 0; also θ ∈ R is called the argument of z (deﬁned uniquely up to a multiple of 2π) and is often denoted by arg z, and

eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ.

Since |eiθ| = 1 we observe that r = |z|, and θ is simply the angle (with positive counterclockwise orientation) between the positive real axis and the half-line starting at the origin and passing through z. (See Figure 2.)

z = reiθ
r θ 0 Figure 2. The polar form of a complex number

Finally, note that if z = reiθ and w = seiϕ, then
zw = rsei(θ+ϕ),
so multiplication by a complex number corresponds to a homothety in R2 (that is, a rotation composed with a dilation).

1.2 Convergence
We make a transition from the arithmetic and geometric properties of complex numbers described above to the key notions of convergence and limits.
A sequence {z1, z2, . . .} of complex numbers is said to converge to w ∈ C if

lim
n→∞

|zn

−

w|

=

0,

and we write

w

=

lim
n→∞

zn.

This notion of convergence is not new. Indeed, since absolute values in C and Euclidean distances in R2 coincide, we see that zn converges to w if and only if the corresponding sequence of points in the complex plane

converges to the point that corresponds to w.

As an exercise, the reader can check that the sequence {zn} converges to w if and only if the sequence of real and imaginary parts of zn converge to the real and imaginary parts of w, respectively.

Since it is sometimes not possible to readily identify the limit of a

sequence (for example, limN→∞

N n=1

1/n3),

it

is

convenient

to

have

a

condition on the sequence itself which is equivalent to its convergence. A

sequence {zn} is said to be a Cauchy sequence (or simply Cauchy) if

|zn − zm| → 0 as n, m → ∞.

In other words, given > 0 there exists an integer N > 0 so that |zn − zm| < whenever n, m > N . An important fact of real analysis is that R is complete: every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges to a real number.1 Since the sequence {zn} is Cauchy if and only if the sequences of real and imaginary parts of zn are, we conclude that every Cauchy sequence in C has a limit in C. We have thus the following result.
Theorem 1.1 C, the complex numbers, is complete.
We now turn our attention to some simple topological considerations that are necessary in our study of functions. Here again, the reader will note that no new notions are introduced, but rather previous notions are now presented in terms of a new vocabulary.

1.3 Sets in the complex plane
If z0 ∈ C and r > 0, we deﬁne the open disc Dr(z0) of radius r centered at z0 to be the set of all complex numbers that are at absolute

1This is sometimes called the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

6

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

value strictly less than r from z0. In other words, Dr(z0) = {z ∈ C : |z − z0| < r},

and this is precisely the usual disc in the plane of radius r centered at z0. The closed disc Dr(z0) of radius r centered at z0 is deﬁned by
Dr(z0) = {z ∈ C : |z − z0| ≤ r},
and the boundary of either the open or closed disc is the circle

Cr(z0) = {z ∈ C : |z − z0| = r}.
Since the unit disc (that is, the open disc centered at the origin and of radius 1) plays an important role in later chapters, we will often denote it by D,
D = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1}.

Given a set Ω ⊂ C, a point z0 is an interior point of Ω if there exists r > 0 such that
Dr(z0) ⊂ Ω.
The interior of Ω consists of all its interior points. Finally, a set Ω is open if every point in that set is an interior point of Ω. This deﬁnition coincides precisely with the deﬁnition of an open set in R2.
A set Ω is closed if its complement Ωc = C − Ω is open. This property can be reformulated in terms of limit points. A point z ∈ C is said to be a limit point of the set Ω if there exists a sequence of points zn ∈ Ω such that zn = z and limn→∞ zn = z. The reader can now check that a set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points. The closure of any set Ω is the union of Ω and its limit points, and is often denoted by Ω.
Finally, the boundary of a set Ω is equal to its closure minus its interior, and is often denoted by ∂Ω.
A set Ω is bounded if there exists M > 0 such that |z| < M whenever z ∈ Ω. In other words, the set Ω is contained in some large disc. If Ω is bounded, we deﬁne its diameter by
diam(Ω) = sup |z − w|.
z,w∈Ω
A set Ω is said to be compact if it is closed and bounded. Arguing as in the case of real variables, one can prove the following.

1. Complex numbers and the complex plane

7

Theorem 1.2 The set Ω ⊂ C is compact if and only if every sequence {zn} ⊂ Ω has a subsequence that converges to a point in Ω.
An open covering of Ω is a family of open sets {Uα} (not necessarily countable) such that
Ω ⊂ Uα.
α
In analogy with the situation in R, we have the following equivalent formulation of compactness.
Theorem 1.3 A set Ω is compact if and only if every open covering of Ω has a ﬁnite subcovering.
Another interesting property of compactness is that of nested sets. We shall in fact use this result at the very beginning of our study of complex function theory, more precisely in the proof of Goursat’s theorem in Chapter 2.
Proposition 1.4 If Ω1 ⊃ Ω2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Ωn ⊃ · · · is a sequence of non-empty compact sets in C with the property that
diam(Ωn) → 0 as n → ∞,
then there exists a unique point w ∈ C such that w ∈ Ωn for all n.
Proof. Choose a point zn in each Ωn. The condition diam(Ωn) → 0 says precisely that {zn} is a Cauchy sequence, therefore this sequence converges to a limit that we call w. Since each set Ωn is compact we must have w ∈ Ωn for all n. Finally, w is the unique point satisfying this property, for otherwise, if w satisﬁed the same property with w = w we would have |w − w | > 0 and the condition diam(Ωn) → 0 would be violated.
The last notion we need is that of connectedness. An open set Ω ⊂ C is said to be connected if it is not possible to ﬁnd two disjoint non-empty open sets Ω1 and Ω2 such that
Ω = Ω1 ∪ Ω2.
A connected open set in C will be called a region. Similarly, a closed set F is connected if one cannot write F = F1 ∪ F2 where F1 and F2 are disjoint non-empty closed sets.
There is an equivalent deﬁnition of connectedness for open sets in terms of curves, which is often useful in practice: an open set Ω is connected if and only if any two points in Ω can be joined by a curve γ entirely contained in Ω. See Exercise 5 for more details.

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

2 Functions on the complex plane
2.1 Continuous functions
Let f be a function deﬁned on a set Ω of complex numbers. We say that f is continuous at the point z0 ∈ Ω if for every > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that whenever z ∈ Ω and |z − z0| < δ then |f (z) − f (z0)| < . An equivalent deﬁnition is that for every sequence {z1, z2, . . .} ⊂ Ω such that lim zn = z0, then lim f (zn) = f (z0).
The function f is said to be continuous on Ω if it is continuous at every point of Ω. Sums and products of continuous functions are also continuous.
Since the notions of convergence for complex numbers and points in R2 are the same, the function f of the complex argument z = x + iy is continuous if and only if it is continuous viewed as a function of the two real variables x and y.
By the triangle inequality, it is immediate that if f is continuous, then the real-valued function deﬁned by z → |f (z)| is continuous. We say that f attains a maximum at the point z0 ∈ Ω if
|f (z)| ≤ |f (z0)| for all z ∈ Ω,
with the inequality reversed for the deﬁnition of a minimum.
Theorem 2.1 A continuous function on a compact set Ω is bounded and attains a maximum and minimum on Ω.
This is of course analogous to the situation of functions of a real variable, and we shall not repeat the simple proof here.

2.2 Holomorphic functions

We now present a notion that is central to complex analysis, and in distinction to our previous discussion we introduce a deﬁnition that is genuinely complex in nature.
Let Ω be an open set in C and f a complex-valued function on Ω. The function f is holomorphic at the point z0 ∈ Ω if the quotient

(1)

f (z0 + h) − f (z0)

h

converges to a limit when h → 0. Here h ∈ C and h = 0 with z0 + h ∈ Ω, so that the quotient is well deﬁned. The limit of the quotient, when it exists, is denoted by f (z0), and is called the derivative of f at z0:

f

(z0)

=

lim
h→0

f (z0

+

h) h

−

f (z0) .

2. Functions on the complex plane

9

It should be emphasized that in the above limit, h is a complex number that may approach 0 from any direction.
The function f is said to be holomorphic on Ω if f is holomorphic at every point of Ω. If C is a closed subset of C, we say that f is holomorphic on C if f is holomorphic in some open set containing C. Finally, if f is holomorphic in all of C we say that f is entire.
Sometimes the terms regular or complex diﬀerentiable are used instead of holomorphic. The latter is natural in view of (1) which mimics the usual deﬁnition of the derivative of a function of one real variable. But despite this resemblance, a holomorphic function of one complex variable will satisfy much stronger properties than a diﬀerentiable function of one real variable. For example, a holomorphic function will actually be inﬁnitely many times complex diﬀerentiable, that is, the existence of the ﬁrst derivative will guarantee the existence of derivatives of any order. This is in contrast with functions of one real variable, since there are diﬀerentiable functions that do not have two derivatives. In fact more is true: every holomorphic function is analytic, in the sense that it has a power series expansion near every point (power series will be discussed in the next section), and for this reason we also use the term analytic as a synonym for holomorphic. Again, this is in contrast with the fact that there are indeﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions of one real variable that cannot be expanded in a power series. (See Exercise 23.)
Example 1. The function f (z) = z is holomorphic on any open set in C, and f (z) = 1. In fact, any polynomial
p(z) = a0 + a1z + · · · + anzn
is holomorphic in the entire complex plane and
p (z) = a1 + · · · + nanzn−1.
This follows from Proposition 2.2 below.

Example 2. The function 1/z is holomorphic on any open set in C that does not contain the origin, and f (z) = −1/z2.

Example 3. The function f (z) = z is not holomorphic. Indeed, we have

f (z0 + h) − f (z0) = h

h

h

which has no limit as h → 0, as one can see by ﬁrst taking h real and then h purely imaginary.

10

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

An important family of examples of holomorphic functions, which we discuss later, are the power series. They contain functions such as ez, sin z, or cos z, and in fact power series play a crucial role in the theory of holomorphic functions, as we already mentioned in the last paragraph. Some other examples of holomorphic functions that will make their appearance in later chapters were given in the introduction to this book.
It is clear from (1) above that a function f is holomorphic at z0 ∈ Ω if and only if there exists a complex number a such that

(2)

f (z0 + h) − f (z0) − ah = hψ(h),

where ψ is a function deﬁned for all small h and limh→0 ψ(h) = 0. Of course, we have a = f (z0). From this formulation, it is clear that f is continuous wherever it is holomorphic. Arguing as in the case of one real variable, using formulation (2) in the case of the chain rule (for example), one proves easily the following desirable properties of holomorphic functions.

Proposition 2.2 If f and g are holomorphic in Ω, then:

(i) f + g is holomorphic in Ω and (f + g) = f + g .

(ii) f g is holomorphic in Ω and (f g) = f g + f g .

(iii) If g(z0) = 0, then f /g is holomorphic at z0 and

f g − fg (f /g) = g2 .

Moreover, if f : Ω → U and g : U → C are holomorphic, the chain rule holds
(g ◦ f ) (z) = g (f (z))f (z) for all z ∈ Ω.

Complex-valued functions as mappings
We now clarify the relationship between the complex and real derivatives. In fact, the third example above should convince the reader that the notion of complex diﬀerentiability diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the usual notion of real diﬀerentiability of a function of two real variables. Indeed, in terms of real variables, the function f (z) = z corresponds to the map F : (x, y) → (x, −y), which is diﬀerentiable in the real sense. Its derivative at a point is the linear map given by its Jacobian, the 2 × 2 matrix of partial derivatives of the coordinate functions. In fact, F is linear and

2. Functions on the complex plane

11

is therefore equal to its derivative at every point. This implies that F is actually indeﬁnitely diﬀerentiable. In particular the existence of the real derivative need not guarantee that f is holomorphic.
This example leads us to associate more generally to each complexvalued function f = u + iv the mapping F (x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y)) from R2 to R2.
Recall that a function F (x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y)) is said to be diﬀerentiable at a point P0 = (x0, y0) if there exists a linear transformation J : R2 → R2 such that
(3) |F (P0 + H) − F (P0) − J(H)| → 0 as |H| → 0, H ∈ R2. |H |

Equivalently, we can write

F (P0 + H) − F (P0) = J(H) + |H|Ψ(H) ,
with |Ψ(H)| → 0 as |H| → 0. The linear transformation J is unique and is called the derivative of F at P0. If F is diﬀerentiable, the partial derivatives of u and v exist, and the linear transformation J is described in the standard basis of R2 by the Jacobian matrix of F

∂u/∂x ∂u/∂y J = JF (x, y) = ∂v/∂x ∂v/∂y .

In the case of complex diﬀerentiation the derivative is a complex number f (z0), while in the case of real derivatives, it is a matrix. There is, however, a connection between these two notions, which is given in terms of special relations that are satisﬁed by the entries of the Jacobian matrix, that is, the partials of u and v. To ﬁnd these relations, consider the limit in (1) when h is ﬁrst real, say h = h1 + ih2 with h2 = 0. Then, if we write z = x + iy, z0 = x0 + iy0, and f (z) = f (x, y), we ﬁnd that

f

=

lim
h1 →0

f (x0

+

−

f (x0, y0)

∂f = ∂x (z0),

where ∂/∂x denotes the usual partial derivative in the x variable. (We ﬁx y0 and think of f as a complex-valued function of the single real variable x.) Now taking h purely imaginary, say h = ih2, a similar argument yields

f (x0, y0

f (x0, y0)

where ∂/∂y is partial diﬀerentiation in the y variable. Therefore, if f is holomorphic we have shown that

∂f 1 ∂f =.
∂x i ∂y

Writing f = u + iv, we ﬁnd after separating real and imaginary parts and using 1/i = −i, that the partials of u and v exist, and they satisfy the following non-trivial relations

∂u ∂v =

and

∂u = −∂v .

∂x ∂y

∂y ∂x

These are the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which link real and complex analysis.
We can clarify the situation further by deﬁning two diﬀerential operators

∂ 1 ∂ 1∂

∂z 2 ∂x i ∂y

and

∂1 =

∂ −1 ∂

∂z 2 ∂x i ∂y

Proposition 2.3 If f is holomorphic at z0, then

∂f

∂f

∂u

∂z (z0) = 0 and f (z0) = ∂z (z0) = 2 ∂z (z0).

Also, if we write F (x, y) = f (z), then F is diﬀerentiable in the sense of real variables, and

det JF (x0, y0) = |f (z0)|2.

Proof. Taking real and imaginary parts, it is easy to see that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are equivalent to ∂f /∂z = 0. Moreover, by our earlier observation

1 ∂f

1 ∂f

f (z0) = 2 ∂x (z0) + i ∂y (z0)

∂f = ∂z (z0),

2. Functions on the complex plane

13

and the Cauchy-Riemann equations give ∂f /∂z = 2∂u/∂z. To prove that F is diﬀerentiable it suﬃces to observe that if H = (h1, h2) and h = h1 + ih2, then the Cauchy-Riemann equations imply

∂u ∂u

JF (x0, y0)(H) =

−i ∂x ∂y

(h1 + ih2) = f (z0)h ,

where we have identiﬁed a complex number with the pair of real and

imaginary parts. After a ﬁnal application of the Cauchy-Riemann equa-

tions, the above results imply that

So far, we have assumed that f is holomorphic and deduced relations satisﬁed by its real and imaginary parts. The next theorem contains an important converse, which completes the circle of ideas presented here.

Theorem 2.4 Suppose f = u + iv is a complex-valued function deﬁned on an open set Ω. If u and v are continuously diﬀerentiable and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations on Ω, then f is holomorphic on Ω and f (z) = ∂f /∂z.

Proof. Write

and ∂v ∂v
v(x + h1, y + h2) − v(x, y) = ∂x h1 + ∂y h2 + |h|ψ2(h),

where ψj(h) → 0 (for j = 1, 2) as |h| tends to 0, and h = h1 + ih2. Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations we ﬁnd that

∂u ∂u

f (z + h) − f (z) =

−i ∂x ∂y

(h1 + ih2) + |h|ψ(h),

where ψ(h) = ψ1(h) + ψ2(h) → 0, as |h| → 0. Therefore f is holomorphic and
∂u ∂f f (z) = 2 = .

2.3 Power series

The prime example of a power series is the complex exponential function, which is deﬁned for z ∈ C by

ez =

∞

zn .

n!

n=0

When z is real, this deﬁnition coincides with the usual exponential function, and in fact, the series above converges absolutely for every z ∈ C. To see this, note that
zn |z|n =,
n! n!

so |ez| can be compared to the series |z|n/n! = e|z| < ∞. In fact, this estimate shows that the series deﬁning ez is uniformly convergent in every disc in C.
In this section we will prove that ez is holomorphic in all of C (it is entire), and that its derivative can be found by diﬀerentiating the series
term by term. Hence

(ez) =

∞ zn−1 n=

∞

zm = ez,

n!

m!

n=0

m=0

and therefore ez is its own derivative. In contrast, the geometric series

∞
zn
n=0

converges absolutely only in the disc |z| < 1, and its sum there is the function 1/(1 − z), which is holomorphic in the open set C − {1}. This identity is proved exactly as when z is real: we ﬁrst observe

N

zn

=

1−

z N +1 ,

1−z

n=0

and then note that if |z| < 1 we must have limN→∞ zN+1 = 0. In general, a power series is an expansion of the form

∞

(5)

anzn ,

n=0

2. Functions on the complex plane

15

where an ∈ C. To test for absolute convergence of this series, we must investigate
∞
|an| |z|n ,
n=0

and we observe that if the series (5) converges absolutely for some z0, then it will also converge for all z in the disc |z| ≤ |z0|. We now prove that there always exists an open disc (possibly empty) on which the power series converges absolutely.

Theorem 2.5 Given a power series

∞ n=0

anzn,

there

exists

0

≤

R

≤

∞

such that:

(i) If |z| < R the series converges absolutely.

(ii) If |z| > R the series diverges.
Moreover, if we use the convention that 1/0 = ∞ and 1/∞ = 0, then R is given by Hadamard’s formula

1/R = lim sup |an|1/n.

The number R is called the radius of convergence of the power series, and the region |z| < R the disc of convergence. In particular, we have R = ∞ in the case of the exponential function, and R = 1 for the geometric series.
Proof. Let L = 1/R where R is deﬁned by the formula in the statement of the theorem, and suppose that L = 0, ∞. (These two easy cases are left as an exercise.) If |z| < R, choose > 0 so small that

(L + )|z| = r < 1.
By the deﬁnition L, we have |an|1/n ≤ L + for all large n, therefore
|an| |z|n ≤ {(L + )|z|}n = rn.
Comparison with the geometric series rn shows that anzn converges.
If |z| > R, then a similar argument proves that there exists a sequence of terms in the series whose absolute value goes to inﬁnity, hence the series diverges.
Remark. On the boundary of the disc of convergence, |z| = R, the situation is more delicate as one can have either convergence or divergence. (See Exercise 19.)

16

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

Further examples of power series that converge in the whole complex plane are given by the standard trigonometric functions; these are deﬁned by

cos z =

∞
(−1)n

z2n

,

and

∞
sin z = (−1)n

z2n+1

(2n)!

(2n + 1)!

and they agree with the usual cosine and sine of a real argument whenever z ∈ R. A simple calculation exhibits a connection between these two functions and the complex exponential, namely,

eiz + e−iz

eiz − e−iz

cos z =

and sin z =

.

2

2i

These are called the Euler formulas for the cosine and sine functions.

Power series provide a very important class of analytic functions that are particularly simple to manipulate.

Theorem 2.6 The power series f (z) =

a

holomor-

phic function in its disc of convergence. The derivative of f is also a

power series obtained by diﬀerentiating term by term the series for f ,

that is,

∞
f (z) = nanzn−1.
n=0

Moreover, f has the same radius of convergence as f .

Proof. The assertion about the radius of convergence of f follows from Hadamard’s formula. Indeed, limn→∞ n1/n = 1, and therefore

lim sup |an|1/n = lim sup |nan|1/n,

so that anzn and nanzn have the same radius of convergence, and hence so do anzn and nanzn−1.
To prove the ﬁrst assertion, we must show that the series

∞
g(z) = nanzn−1
n=0

gives the derivative of f . For that, let R denote the radius of convergence of f , and suppose |z0| < r < R. Write

f (z) = SN (z) + EN (z) ,

where

where we have used the fact that |z0| < r and |z0 + h| < r. The expression on the right is the tail end of a convergent series, since g converges absolutely on |z| < R. Therefore, given > 0 we can ﬁnd N1 so that N > N1 implies
EN (z0 + h) − EN (z0) < . h

Also, since limN→∞ SN (z0) = g(z0), we can ﬁnd N2 so that N > N2 implies
|SN (z0) − g(z0)| < .
If we ﬁx N so that both N > N1 and N > N2 hold, then we can ﬁnd δ > 0 so that |h| < δ implies

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

Corollary 2.7 A power series is inﬁnitely complex diﬀerentiable in its disc of convergence, and the higher derivatives are also power series obtained by termwise diﬀerentiation.
We have so far dealt only with power series centered at the origin. More generally, a power series centered at z0 ∈ C is an expression of the form
∞
f (z) = an(z − z0)n.
n=0
The disc of convergence of f is now centered at z0 and its radius is still given by Hadamard’s formula. In fact, if
∞
g(z) = anzn,
n=0
then f is simply obtained by translating g, namely f (z) = g(w) where w = z − z0. As a consequence everything about g also holds for f after we make the appropriate translation. In particular, by the chain rule,
∞
f (z) = g (w) = nan(z − z0)n−1.
n=0

A function f deﬁned on an open set Ω is said to be analytic (or have
a power series expansion) at a point z0 ∈ Ω if there exists a power series an(z − z0)n centered at z0, with positive radius of convergence, such that

∞
f (z) = an(z − z0)n
n=0

for all z in a neighborhood of z0.

If f has a power series expansion at every point in Ω, we say that f is analytic on Ω.
By Theorem 2.6, an analytic function on Ω is also holomorphic there. A deep theorem which we prove in the next chapter says that the converse is true: every holomorphic function is analytic. For that reason, we use the terms holomorphic and analytic interchangeably.

3 Integration along curves
In the deﬁnition of a curve, we distinguish between the one-dimensional geometric object in the plane (endowed with an orientation), and its

3. Integration along curves

19

parametrization, which is a mapping from a closed interval to C, that is not uniquely determined.
A parametrized curve is a function z(t) which maps a closed interval [a, b] ⊂ R to the complex plane. We shall impose regularity conditions on the parametrization which are always veriﬁed in the situations that occur in this book. We say that the parametrized curve is smooth if z (t) exists and is continuous on [a, b], and z (t) = 0 for t ∈ [a, b]. At the points t = a and t = b, the quantities z (a) and z (b) are interpreted as the one-sided limits

z(a + h) − z(a)

z(b + h) − z(b)

z (a) = lim

and z (b) = lim

.

h→0

h

h→0

h

h>0

h<0

In general, these quantities are called the right-hand derivative of z(t) at a, and the left-hand derivative of z(t) at b, respectively.
Similarly we say that the parametrized curve is piecewise-smooth if z is continuous on [a, b] and if there exist points

a = a0 < a1 < · · · < an = b ,

where z(t) is smooth in the intervals [ak, ak+1]. In particular, the righthand derivative at ak may diﬀer from the left-hand derivative at ak for k = 1, . . . , n − 1.
Two parametrizations,

z : [a, b] → C and z˜ : [c, d] → C,

are equivalent if there exists a continuously diﬀerentiable bijection s → t(s) from [c, d] to [a, b] so that t (s) > 0 and

z˜(s) = z(t(s)).

The condition t (s) > 0 says precisely that the orientation is preserved: as s travels from c to d, then t(s) travels from a to b. The family of all parametrizations that are equivalent to z(t) determines a smooth curve γ ⊂ C, namely the image of [a, b] under z with the orientation given by z as t travels from a to b. We can deﬁne a curve γ− obtained from the curve γ by reversing the orientation (so that γ and γ− consist of the same points in the plane). As a particular parametrization for γ− we can take z− : [a, b] → R2 deﬁned by
z−(t) = z(b + a − t).

20

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

It is also clear how to deﬁne a piecewise-smooth curve. The points z(a) and z(b) are called the end-points of the curve and are independent on the parametrization. Since γ carries an orientation, it is natural to say that γ begins at z(a) and ends at z(b).
A smooth or piecewise-smooth curve is closed if z(a) = z(b) for any of its parametrizations. Finally, a smooth or piecewise-smooth curve is simple if it is not self-intersecting, that is, z(t) = z(s) unless s = t. Of course, if the curve is closed to begin with, then we say that it is simple whenever z(t) = z(s) unless s = t, or s = a and t = b.

Figure 3. A closed piecewise-smooth curve
For brevity, we shall call any piecewise-smooth curve a curve, since these will be the objects we shall be primarily concerned with.
A basic example consists of a circle. Consider the circle Cr(z0) centered at z0 and of radius r, which by deﬁnition is the set
Cr(z0) = {z ∈ C : |z − z0| = r}.
The positive orientation (counterclockwise) is the one that is given by the standard parametrization
z(t) = z0 + reit, where t ∈ [0, 2π],
while the negative orientation (clockwise) is given by z(t) = z0 + re−it, where t ∈ [0, 2π].
In the following chapters, we shall denote by C a general positively oriented circle.
An important tool in the study of holomorphic functions is integration of functions along curves. Loosely speaking, a key theorem in complex

3. Integration along curves

21

analysis says that if a function is holomorphic in the interior of a closed curve γ, then

f (z) dz = 0,
γ

and we shall turn our attention to a version of this theorem (called Cauchy’s theorem) in the next chapter. Here we content ourselves with the necessary deﬁnitions and properties of the integral.
Given a smooth curve γ in C parametrized by z : [a, b] → C, and f a continuous function on γ, we deﬁne the integral of f along γ by

b

f (z) dz = f (z(t))z (t) dt.

γ

a

In order for this deﬁnition to be meaningful, we must show that the right-hand integral is independent of the parametrization chosen for γ. Say that z˜ is an equivalent parametrization as above. Then the change of variables formula and the chain rule imply that

b

d

d

f (z(t))z (t) dt = f (z(t(s)))z (t(s))t (s) ds = f (z˜(s))z˜ (s) ds.

a

c

This proves that the integral of f over γ is well deﬁned. If γ is piecewise smooth, then the integral of f over γ is simply the
sum of the integrals of f over the smooth parts of γ, so if z(t) is a piecewise-smooth parametrization as before, then

n−1 ak+1

f (z) dz =

f (z(t))z (t) dt.

γ

k=0 ak

By deﬁnition, the length of the smooth curve γ is

b
length(γ) = |z (t)| dt.
a
Arguing as we just did, it is clear that this deﬁnition is also independent of the parametrization. Also, if γ is only piecewise-smooth, then its length is the sum of the lengths of its smooth parts.

Proposition 3.1 Integration of continuous functions over curves satisﬁes the following properties:

22

Proof. The ﬁrst property follows from the deﬁnition and the linearity of the Riemann integral. The second property is left as an exercise. For the third, note that

as was to be shown.
As we have said, Cauchy’s theorem states that for appropriate closed curves γ in an open set Ω on which f is holomorphic, then

f (z) dz = 0.
γ
The existence of primitives gives a ﬁrst manifestation of this phenomenon. Suppose f is a function on the open set Ω. A primitive for f on Ω is a function F that is holomorphic on Ω and such that F (z) = f (z) for all z ∈ Ω.
Theorem 3.2 If a continuous function f has a primitive F in Ω, and γ is a curve in Ω that begins at w1 and ends at w2, then
f (z) dz = F (w2) − F (w1).
γ

3. Integration along curves

23

Proof. If γ is smooth, the proof is a simple application of the chain rule and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Indeed, if z(t) : [a, b] → C is a parametrization for γ, then z(a) = w1 and z(b) = w2, and we have

b

f (z) dz = f (z(t))z (t) dt

If γ is only piecewise-smooth, then arguing as we just did, we obtain a telescopic sum, and we have

f (z) dz = F (z(ak+1)) − F (z(ak))

γ

k=0

= F (z(an)) − F (z(a0))

= F (z(b)) − F (z(a)).

Corollary 3.3 If γ is a closed curve in an open set Ω, and f is continuous and has a primitive in Ω, then

f (z) dz = 0.
γ

This is immediate since the end-points of a closed curve coincide.
For example, the function f (z) = 1/z does not have a primitive in the open set C − {0}, since if C is the unit circle parametrized by z(t) = eit, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π, we have

2π ieit

f (z) dz =

In subsequent chapters, we shall see that this innocent calculation, which
provides an example of a function f and closed curve γ for which γ f (z) dz = 0, lies at the heart of the theory.

Corollary 3.4 If f is holomorphic in a region Ω and f = 0, then f is constant.

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

Proof. Fix a point w0 ∈ Ω. It suﬃces to show that f (w) = f (w0) for all w ∈ Ω.
Since Ω is connected, for any w ∈ Ω, there exists a curve γ which joins w0 to w. Since f is clearly a primitive for f , we have

f (z) dz = f (w) − f (w0).
γ
By assumption, f = 0 so the integral on the left is 0, and we conclude that f (w) = f (w0) as desired.

Remark on notation. When convenient, we follow the practice of using the notation f (z) = O(g(z)) to mean that there is a constant C > 0 such that |f (z)| ≤ C|g(z)| for z in a neighborhood of the point in question. In addition, we say f (z) = o(g(z)) when |f (z)/g(z)| → 0. We also write f (z) ∼ g(z) to mean that f (z)/g(z) → 1.

1. Describe geometrically the sets of points z in the complex plane deﬁned by the following relations:
(a) |z − z1| = |z − z2| where z1, z2 ∈ C. (b) 1/z = z. (c) Re(z) = 3. (d) Re(z) > c, (resp., ≥ c) where c ∈ R. (e) Re(az + b) > 0 where a, b ∈ C. (f) |z| = Re(z) + 1. (g) Im(z) = c with c ∈ R.

2. Let ·, · denote the usual inner product in R2. In other words, if Z = (x1, y1) and W = (x2, y2), then
Z, W = x1x2 + y1y2.
Similarly, we may deﬁne a Hermitian inner product (·, ·) in C by
(z, w) = zw.

4. Show that it is impossible to deﬁne a total ordering on C. In other words, one cannot ﬁnd a relation between complex numbers so that:
(i) For any two complex numbers z, w, one and only one of the following is true: z w, w z or z = w.
(ii) For all z1, z2, z3 ∈ C the relation z1 z2 implies z1 + z3 z2 + z3.
(iii) Moreover, for all z1, z2, z3 ∈ C with z3 0, then z1 z2 implies z1z3 z2z3.
[Hint: First check if i 0 is possible.]

5. A set Ω is said to be pathwise connected if any two points in Ω can be joined by a (piecewise-smooth) curve entirely contained in Ω. The purpose of this exercise is to prove that an open set Ω is pathwise connected if and only if Ω is connected.
(a) Suppose ﬁrst that Ω is open and pathwise connected, and that it can be written as Ω = Ω1 ∪ Ω2 where Ω1 and Ω2 are disjoint non-empty open sets. Choose two points w1 ∈ Ω1 and w2 ∈ Ω2 and let γ denote a curve in Ω joining w1 to w2. Consider a parametrization z : [0, 1] → Ω of this curve with z(0) = w1 and z(1) = w2, and let
t∗ = sup {t : z(s) ∈ Ω1 for all 0 ≤ s < t}.
0≤t≤1
Arrive at a contradiction by considering the point z(t∗).
(b) Conversely, suppose that Ω is open and connected. Fix a point w ∈ Ω and let Ω1 ⊂ Ω denote the set of all points that can be joined to w by a curve contained in Ω. Also, let Ω2 ⊂ Ω denote the set of all points that cannot be joined to w by a curve in Ω. Prove that both Ω1 and Ω2 are open, disjoint and their union is Ω. Finally, since Ω1 is non-empty (why?) conclude that Ω = Ω1 as desired.

26

Chapter 1. PRELIMINARIES TO COMPLEX ANALYSIS

The proof actually shows that the regularity and type of curves we used to deﬁne
pathwise connectedness can be relaxed without changing the equivalence between the two deﬁnitions when Ω is open. For instance, we may take all curves to be continuous, or simply polygonal lines.2

6. Let Ω be an open set in C and z ∈ Ω. The connected component (or simply the component) of Ω containing z is the set Cz of all points w in Ω that can be joined to z by a curve entirely contained in Ω.
(a) Check ﬁrst that Cz is open and connected. Then, show that w ∈ Cz deﬁnes an equivalence relation, that is: (i) z ∈ Cz, (ii) w ∈ Cz implies z ∈ Cw, and (iii) if w ∈ Cz and z ∈ Cζ, then w ∈ Cζ. Thus Ω is the union of all its connected components, and two components are either disjoint or coincide.
(b) Show that Ω can have only countably many distinct connected components.
(c) Prove that if Ω is the complement of a compact set, then Ω has only one unbounded component.
[Hint: For (b), one would otherwise obtain an uncountable number of disjoint open balls. Now, each ball contains a point with rational coordinates. For (c), note that the complement of a large disc containing the compact set is connected.]

7. The family of mappings introduced here plays an important role in complex analysis. These mappings, sometimes called Blaschke factors, will reappear in various applications in later chapters.

w−z 1 − wz < 1

if |z| < 1 and |w| < 1,

and also that

if |z| = 1 or |w| = 1.

[Hint: Why can one assume that z is real? It then suﬃces to prove that

(r − w)(r − w) ≤ (1 − rw)(1 − rw)

with equality for appropriate r and |w|.]

(b) Prove that for a ﬁxed w in the unit disc D, the mapping

8. Suppose U and V are open sets in the complex plane. Prove that if f : U → V and g : V → C are two functions that are diﬀerentiable (in the real sense, that is, as functions of the two real variables x and y), and h = g ◦ f , then

2 Cauchy’s Theorem and Its Applications

The solution of a large number of problems can be reduced, in the last analysis, to the evaluation of definite integrals; thus mathematicians have been much occupied with this task... However, among many results obtained, a number were initially discovered by the aid of a type of induction based on the passage from real to imaginary. Often passage of this kind led directly to remarkable results. Nevertheless this part of the theory, as has been observed by Laplace, is subject to various diﬃculties...
After having reﬂected on this subject and brought together various results mentioned above, I hope to establish the passage from the real to the imaginary based on a direct and rigorous analysis; my researches have thus led me to the method which is the object of this memoir...
A. L. Cauchy, 1827

In the previous chapter, we discussed several preliminary ideas in complex analysis: open sets in C, holomorphic functions, and integration along curves. The ﬁrst remarkable result of the theory exhibits a deep connection between these notions. Loosely stated, Cauchy’s theorem says that if f is holomorphic in an open set Ω and γ ⊂ Ω is a closed curve whose interior is also contained in Ω then

(1)

f (z) dz = 0.

γ

Many results that follow, and in particular the calculus of residues, are related in one way or another to this fact.
A precise and general formulation of Cauchy’s theorem requires deﬁning unambiguously the “interior” of a curve, and this is not always an easy task. At this early stage of our study, we shall make use of the device of limiting ourselves to regions whose boundaries are curves that are “toy contours.” As the name suggests, these are closed curves whose visualization is so simple that the notion of their interior will be unam-

33

biguous, and the proof of Cauchy’s theorem in this setting will be quite direct. For many applications, it will suﬃce to restrict ourselves to these types of curves. At a later stage, we take up the questions related to more general curves, their interiors, and the extended form of Cauchy’s theorem.
Our initial version of Cauchy’s theorem begins with the observation that it suﬃces that f have a primitive in Ω, by Corollary 3.3 in Chapter 1. The existence of such a primitive for toy contours will follow from a theorem of Goursat (which is itself a simple special case)1 that asserts that if f is holomorphic in an open set that contains a triangle T and its interior, then

f (z) dz = 0.
T
It is noteworthy that this simple case of Cauchy’s theorem suﬃces to prove some of its more complicated versions. From there, we can prove the existence of primitives in the interior of some simple regions, and therefore prove Cauchy’s theorem in that setting. As a ﬁrst application of this viewpoint, we evaluate several real integrals by using appropriate toy contours.
The above ideas also lead us to a central result of this chapter, the Cauchy integral formula; this states that if f is holomorphic in an open set containing a circle C and its interior, then for all z inside C,

1 f (ζ)

f (z) =

dζ.

2πi C ζ − z

Diﬀerentiation of this identity yields other integral formulas, and in particular we obtain the regularity of holomorphic functions. This is remarkable, since holomorphicity assumed only the existence of the ﬁrst derivative, and yet we obtain as a consequence the existence of derivatives of all orders. (An analogous statement is decisively false in the case of real variables!)
The theory developed up to that point already has a number of noteworthy consequences:

• The property at the base of “analytic continuation,” namely that a holomorphic function is determined by its restriction to any open subset of its domain of deﬁnition. This is a consequence of the fact that holomorphic functions have power series expansions.

1Goursat’s result came after Cauchy’s theorem, and its interest is the technical fact that its proof requires only the existence of the complex derivative at each point, and not its continuity. For the earlier proof, see Exercise 5.

34

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

• Liouville’s theorem, which yields a quick proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
• Morera’s theorem, which gives a simple integral characterization of holomorphic functions, and shows that these functions are preserved under uniform limits.

1 Goursat’s theorem
Corollary 3.3 in the previous chapter says that if f has a primitive in an open set Ω, then
f (z) dz = 0
γ
for any closed curve γ in Ω. Conversely, if we can show that the above relation holds for some types of curves γ, then a primitive will exist. Our starting point is Goursat’s theorem, from which in eﬀect we shall deduce most of the other results in this chapter.
Theorem 1.1 If Ω is an open set in C, and T ⊂ Ω a triangle whose interior is also contained in Ω, then

f (z) dz = 0
T
whenever f is holomorphic in Ω.

Proof. We call T (0) our original triangle (with a ﬁxed orientation which we choose to be positive), and let d(0) and p(0) denote the diameter and perimeter of T (0), respectively. The ﬁrst step in our construction
consists of bisecting each side of the triangle and connecting the midpoints. This creates four new smaller triangles, denoted T1(1), T2(1), T3(1), and T4(1) that are similar to the original triangle. The construction and orientation of each triangle are illustrated in Figure 1. The orientation
is chosen to be consistent with that of the original triangle, and so after
cancellations arising from integrating over the same side in two opposite
directions, we have

for otherwise (2) would be contradicted. We choose a triangle that satisﬁes this inequality, and rename it T (1). Observe that if d(1) and p(1) denote the diameter and perimeter of T (1), respectively, then d(1) = (1/2)d(0) and p(1) = (1/2)p(0). We now repeat this process for the triangle T (1), bisecting it into four smaller triangles. Continuing this process, we obtain a sequence of triangles
T (0), T (1), . . . , T (n), . . .
with the properties that

f (z) dz ≤ 4n

and

d(n) = 2−nd(0), p(n) = 2−np(0)

where d(n) and p(n) denote the diameter and perimeter of T (n), respectively. We also denote by T (n) the solid closed triangle with boundary T (n), and observe that our construction yields a sequence of nested compact sets
T (0) ⊃ T (1) ⊃ · · · ⊃ T (n) ⊃ · · ·

whose diameter goes to 0. By Proposition 1.4 in Chapter 1, there exists a unique point z0 that belongs to all the solid triangles T (n). Since f is holomorphic at z0 we can write
f (z) = f (z0) + f (z0)(z − z0) + ψ(z)(z − z0) ,
where ψ(z) → 0 as z → z0. Since the constant f (z0) and the linear function f (z0)(z − z0) have primitives, we can integrate the above equality using Corollary 3.3 in the previous chapter, and obtain

(3)

f (z) dz =

ψ(z)(z − z0) dz.

T (n)

T (n)

36

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

Now z0 belongs to the closure of the solid triangle T (n) and z to its boundary, so we must have |z − z0| ≤ d(n), and using (3) we get, by (iii)
in Proposition 3.1 of the previous chapter, the estimate

f (z) dz ≤ nd(n)p(n),
T (n)
where n = supz∈T (n) |ψ(z)| → 0 as n → ∞. Therefore
f (z) dz ≤ n4−nd(0)p(0) ,
T (n)
which yields our ﬁnal estimate

f (z) dz ≤ 4n

f (z) dz ≤ nd(0)p(0).

Letting n → ∞ concludes the proof since n → 0.

This is immediate since we ﬁrst choose an orientation as in Figure 2 and note that

f (z) dz = f (z) dz + f (z) dz.

2 Local existence of primitives and Cauchy’s theorem in a disc
We ﬁrst prove the existence of primitives in a disc as a consequence of Goursat’s theorem.
Theorem 2.1 A holomorphic function in an open disc has a primitive in that disc.

Proof. After a translation, we may assume without loss of generality that the disc, say D, is centered at the origin. Given a point z ∈ D, consider the piecewise-smooth curve that joins 0 to z ﬁrst by moving in the horizontal direction from 0 to z˜ where z˜ = Re(z), and then in the vertical direction from z˜ to z. We choose the orientation from 0 to z, and denote this polygonal line (which consists of at most two segments) by γz, as shown on Figure 3.

z

γz

0

z˜

Figure 3. The polygonal line γz

Deﬁne
F (z) = f (w) dw.
γz
The choice of γz gives an unambiguous deﬁnition of the function F (z). We contend that F is holomorphic in D and F (z) = f (z). To prove this, ﬁx z ∈ D and let h ∈ C be so small that z + h also belongs to the disc. Now consider the diﬀerence

F (z + h) − F (z) =

f (w) dw − f (w) dw.

γz+h

γz

38

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

The function f is ﬁrst integrated along γz+h with the original orientation, and then along γz with the reverse orientation (because of the minus sign in front of the second integral). This corresponds to (a) in Figure 4. Since we integrate f over the line segment starting at the origin in two opposite directions, it cancels, leaving us with the contour in (b). Then, we complete the square and triangle as shown in (c), so that after an application of Goursat’s theorem for triangles and rectangles we are left with the line segment from z to z + h as given in (d).

z+h

Figure 4. Relation between the polygonal lines γz and γz+h

Hence the above cancellations yield

F (z + h) − F (z) = f (w) dw
η
where η is the straight line segment from z to z + h. Since f is continuous at z we can write
f (w) = f (z) + ψ(w)

where ψ(w) → 0 as w → z. Therefore (4)

F (z + h) − F (z) = f (z) dw + ψ(w) dw = f (z) dw + ψ(w) dw.

On the one hand, the constant 1 has w as a primitive, so the ﬁrst integral is simply h by an application of Theorem 3.2 in Chapter 1. On the other

39

hand, we have the following estimate:

ψ(w) dw ≤ sup |ψ(w)| |h|.

η

w∈η

Since the supremum above goes to 0 as h tends to 0, we conclude from equation (4) that

F (z + h) − F (z)

lim

= f (z) ,

h→0

h

thereby proving that F is a primitive for f on the disc.

This theorem says that locally, every holomorphic function has a primitive. It is crucial to realize, however, that the theorem is true not only for arbitrary discs, but also for other sets as well. We shall return to this point shortly in our discussion of “toy contours.”

Theorem 2.2 (Cauchy’s theorem for a disc) If f is holomorphic in a disc, then

f (z) dz = 0
γ
for any closed curve γ in that disc.
Proof. Since f has a primitive, we can apply Corollary 3.3 of Chapter 1.

Corollary 2.3 Suppose f is holomorphic in an open set containing the circle C and its interior. Then
f (z) dz = 0.
C
Proof. Let D be the disc with boundary circle C. Then there exists a slightly larger disc D which contains D and so that f is holomorphic on D . We may now apply Cauchy’s theorem in D to conclude that C f (z) dz = 0.
In fact, the proofs of the theorem and its corollary apply whenever we can deﬁne without ambiguity the “interior” of a contour, and construct appropriate polygonal paths in an open neighborhood of that contour and its interior. In the case of the circle, whose interior is the disc, there was no problem since the geometry of the disc made it simple to travel horizontally and vertically inside it.

40

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

The following deﬁnition is loosely stated, although its applications will be clear and unambiguous. We call a toy contour any closed curve where the notion of interior is obvious, and a construction similar to that in Theorem 2.1 is possible in a neighborhood of the curve and its interior. Its positive orientation is that for which the interior is to the left as we travel along the toy contour. This is consistent with the deﬁnition of the positive orientation of a circle. For example, circles, triangles, and rectangles are toy contours, since in each case we can modify (and actually copy) the argument given previously.
Another important example of a toy contour is the “keyhole” Γ (illustrated in Figure 5), which we shall put to use in the proof of the Cauchy integral formula. It consists of two almost complete circles, one large

Γ

Γint

Figure 5. The keyhole contour

and one small, connected by a narrow corridor. The interior of Γ, which we denote by Γint, is clearly that region enclosed by the curve, and can be given precise meaning with enough work. We ﬁx a point z0 in that interior. If f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of Γ and its interior, then it is holomorphic in the inside of a slightly larger keyhole, say Λ, whose interior Λint contains Γ ∪ Γint. If z ∈ Λint, let γz denote any curve contained inside Λint connecting z0 to z, and which consists of ﬁnitely many horizontal or vertical segments (as in Figure 6). If ηz is any other such curve, the rectangle version of Goursat’s theorem (Corollary 1.2) implies that

f (w) dw = f (w) dw ,

γz

Arguing as above allows us to show that F is a primitive of f in Λint and therefore Γ f (z) dz = 0.
The important point is that for a toy contour γ we easily have that
f (z) dz = 0 ,

whenever f is holomorphic in an open set that contains the contour γ and its interior.
Other examples of toy contours which we shall encounter in applications and for which Cauchy’s theorem and its corollary also hold are given in Figure 7.
While Cauchy’s theorem for toy contours is suﬃcient for most applications we deal with, the question still remains as to what happens for more general curves. We take up this matter in Appendix B, where we prove Jordan’s theorem for piecewise-smooth curves. This theorem states that a simple closed piecewise-smooth curve has a well deﬁned interior that is “simply connected.” As a consequence, we ﬁnd that even in this more general situation, Cauchy’s theorem holds.
3 Evaluation of some integrals
Here we take up the idea that originally motivated Cauchy. We shall show by several examples how some integrals may be evaluated by the use of his theorem. A more systematic approach, in terms of the calculus of residues, may be found in the next chapter.

and our desired formula is established. In the case ξ < 0, we then consider the symmetric rectangle, in the lower half-plane.
The technique of shifting the contour of integration, which was used in the previous example, has many other applications. Note that the original integral (5) is taken over the real line, which by an application of Cauchy’s theorem is then shifted upwards or downwards (depending on the sign of ξ) in the complex plane.

4 Cauchy’s integral formulas

Representation formulas, and in particular integral representation formulas, play an important role in mathematics, since they allow us to recover a function on a large set from its behavior on a smaller set. For example, we saw in Book I that a solution of the steady-state heat equation in the disc was completely determined by its boundary values on the circle via a convolution with the Poisson kernel

1 2π

(7)

u(r, θ) = 2π 0

Pr(θ − ϕ)u(1, ϕ) dϕ.

In the case of holomorphic functions, the situation is analogous, which is not surprising since the real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic function are harmonic.3 Here, we will prove an integral representation formula in a manner that is independent of the theory of harmonic functions. In fact, it is also possible to recover the Poisson integral formula (7) as a consequence of the next theorem (see Exercises 11 and 12).

Theorem 4.1 Suppose f is holomorphic in an open set that contains the closure of a disc D. If C denotes the boundary circle of this disc with the positive orientation, then

1 f (z) =

f (ζ) dζ

for any point z ∈ D.

2πi C ζ − z

3This fact is an immediate consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We refer the reader to Exercise 11 in Chapter 1.

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

Proof. Fix z ∈ D and consider the “keyhole” Γδ, which omits the point z as shown in Figure 10.

Γδ,

Here δ is the width of the corridor, and the radius of the small circle centered at z. Since the function F (ζ) = f (ζ)/(ζ − z) is holomorphic away from the point ζ = z, we have

F (ζ) dζ = 0
Γδ,

by Cauchy’s theorem for the chosen toy contour. Now we make the corridor narrower by letting δ tend to 0, and use the continuity of F to see that in the limit, the integrals over the two sides of the corridor cancel out. The remaining part consists of two curves, the large boundary circle C with the positive orientation, and a small circle C centered at z of radius and oriented negatively, that is, clockwise. To see what happens to the integral over the small circle we write

f (ζ) − f (z) f (z)

(8)

F (ζ) = ζ − z + ζ − z

and note that since f is holomorphic the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (8) is bounded so that its integral over C goes to 0 as → 0. To

as was to be shown.

Remarks. Our earlier discussion of toy contours provides simple extensions of the Cauchy integral formula; for instance, if f is holomorphic in an open set that contains a (positively oriented) rectangle R and its interior, then

1 f (ζ)

f (z) = 2πi

R ζ − z dζ ,

whenever z belongs to the interior of R. To establish this result, it suﬃces to repeat the proof of Theorem 4.1 replacing the “circular” keyhole by a “rectangular” keyhole.
It should also be noted that the above integral vanishes when z is outside R, since in this case F (ζ) = f (ζ)/(ζ − z) is holomorphic inside R. Of course, a similar result also holds for the circle or any other toy contour.

As a corollary to the Cauchy integral formula, we arrive at a second remarkable fact about holomorphic functions, namely their regularity. We also obtain further integral formulas expressing the derivatives of f inside the disc in terms of the values of f on the boundary.

Corollary 4.2 If f is holomorphic in an open set Ω, then f has inﬁnitely many complex derivatives in Ω. Moreover, if C ⊂ Ω is a circle whose interior is also contained in Ω, then

f (n)(z) = n! 2πi

f (ζ) C (ζ − z)n+1 dζ

for all z in the interior of C.

48

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

We recall that, as in the above theorem, we take the circle C to have positive orientation.

Proof. The proof is by induction on n, the case n = 0 being simply the Cauchy integral formula. Suppose that f has up to n − 1 complex derivatives and that

f (n−1)(z) = (n − 1)! 2πi

f (ζ) C (ζ − z)n dζ.

Now for h small, the diﬀerence quotient for f (n−1) takes the form

We now recall that

From now on, we call the formulas of Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.2 the Cauchy integral formulas.

Another striking consequence of the Cauchy integral formula is its connection with power series. In Chapter 1, we proved that a power series is holomorphic in the interior of its disc of convergence, and promised a proof of a converse, which is the content of the next theorem.

Theorem 4.4 Suppose f is holomorphic in an open set Ω. If D is a disc centered at z0 and whose closure is contained in Ω, then f has a power series expansion at z0

f (z) = an(z − z0)n

for all z ∈ D, and the coeﬃcients are given by

f (z) =

This proves the power series expansion; further the use of the Cauchy integral formulas for the derivatives (or simply diﬀerentiation of the series) proves the formula for an.

Observe that since power series deﬁne indeﬁnitely (complex) diﬀer-

entiable functions, the theorem gives another proof that a holomorphic

function is automatically indeﬁnitely diﬀerentiable.

Another important observation is that the power series expansion of

f centered at z0 converges in any disc, no matter how large, as long

as its closure is contained in Ω. In particular, if f is entire (that is,

holomorphic on all of C), the theorem implies that f has a power series

expansion around 0, say f (z) =

Corollary 4.5 (Liouville’s theorem) If f is entire and bounded, then f is constant.

Proof. It suﬃces to prove that f = 0, since C is connected, and we may then apply Corollary 3.4 in Chapter 1.
For each z0 ∈ C and all R > 0, the Cauchy inequalities yield
B |f (z0)| ≤ R
where B is a bound for f . Letting R → ∞ gives the desired result.

As an application of our work so far, we can give an elegant proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.

Corollary 4.6 Every non-constant polynomial P (z) = anzn + · · · + a0 with complex coeﬃcients has a root in C.

Proof. If P has no roots, then 1/P (z) is a bounded holomorphic function. To see this, we can of course assume that an = 0, and write

P (z) zn = an +

an−1 z

+

···

+

a0 zn

4. Cauchy’s integral formulas

51

whenever z = 0. Since each term in the parentheses goes to 0 as |z| → ∞ we conclude that there exists R > 0 so that if c = |an|/2, then
|P (z)| ≥ c|z|n whenever |z| > R.

In particular, P is bounded from below when |z| > R. Since P is continuous and has no roots in the disc |z| ≤ R, it is bounded from below in that disc as well, thereby proving our claim.
By Liouville’s theorem we then conclude that 1/P is constant. This contradicts our assumption that P is non-constant and proves the corollary.

Corollary 4.7 Every polynomial P (z) = anzn + · · · + a0 of degree n ≥ 1 has precisely n roots in C. If these roots are denoted by w1, . . . , wn, then P can be factored as
P (z) = an(z − w1)(z − w2) · · · (z − wn).
Proof. By the previous result P has a root, say w1. Then, writing z = (z − w1) + w1, inserting this expression for z in P , and using the binomial formula we get
P (z) = bn(z − w1)n + · · · + b1(z − w1) + b0,
where b0, . . . , bn−1 are new coeﬃcients, and bn = an. Since P (w1) = 0, we ﬁnd that b0 = 0, therefore
P (z) = (z − w1) bn(z − w1)n−1 + · · · + b1 = (z − w1)Q(z),
where Q is a polynomial of degree n − 1. By induction on the degree of the polynomial, we conclude that P (z) has n roots and can be expressed as
P (z) = c(z − w1)(z − w2) · · · (z − wn)
for some c ∈ C. Expanding the right-hand side, we realize that the coefﬁcient of zn is c and therefore c = an as claimed.
Finally, we end this section with a discussion of analytic continuation (the third of the “miracles” we mentioned in the introduction). It states that the “genetic code” of a holomorphic function is determined (that is, the function is ﬁxed) if we know its values on appropriate arbitrarily small subsets. Note that in the theorem below, Ω is assumed connected.

52

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

Theorem 4.8 Suppose f is a holomorphic function in a region Ω that vanishes on a sequence of distinct points with a limit point in Ω. Then f is identically 0.
In other words, if the zeros of a holomorphic function f in the connected open set Ω accumulate in Ω, then f = 0.
Proof. Suppose that z0 ∈ Ω is a limit point for the sequence {wk}∞ k=1 and that f (wk) = 0. First, we show that f is identically zero in a small disc containing z0. For that, we choose a disc D centered at z0 and contained in Ω, and consider the power series expansion of f in that disc
∞
f (z) = an(z − z0)n.
n=0
If f is not identically zero, there exists a smallest integer m such that am = 0. But then we can write
f (z) = am(z − z0)m(1 + g(z − z0)),
where g(z − z0) converges to 0 as z → z0. Taking z = wk = z0 for a sequence of points converging to z0, we get a contradiction since am(wk − z0)m = 0 and 1 + g(wk − z0) = 0, but f (wk) = 0.
We conclude the proof using the fact that Ω is connected. Let U denote the interior of the set of points where f (z) = 0. Then U is open by deﬁnition and non-empty by the argument just given. The set U is also closed since if zn ∈ U and zn → z, then f (z) = 0 by continuity, and f vanishes in a neighborhood of z by the argument above. Hence z ∈ U . Now if we let V denote the complement of U in Ω, we conclude that U and V are both open, disjoint, and

Ω = U ∪ V.

Since Ω is connected we conclude that either U or V is empty. (Here we use one of the two equivalent deﬁnitions of connectedness discussed in Chapter 1.) Since z0 ∈ U , we ﬁnd that U = Ω and the proof is complete.

An immediate consequence of the theorem is the following.
Corollary 4.9 Suppose f and g are holomorphic in a region Ω and f (z) = g(z) for all z in some non-empty open subset of Ω (or more generally for z in some sequence of distinct points with limit point in Ω). Then f (z) = g(z) throughout Ω.

5. Further applications

53

Suppose we are given a pair of functions f and F analytic in regions Ω and Ω , respectively, with Ω ⊂ Ω . If the two functions agree on the smaller set Ω, we say that F is an analytic continuation of f into the region Ω . The corollary then guarantees that there can be only one such analytic continuation, since F is uniquely determined by f .

5 Further applications
We gather in this section various consequences of the results proved so far.

5.1 Morera’s theorem
A direct application of what was proved here is a converse of Cauchy’s theorem.
Theorem 5.1 Suppose f is a continuous function in the open disc D such that for any triangle T contained in D

then f is holomorphic.

f (z) dz = 0,
T

Proof. By the proof of Theorem 2.1 the function f has a primitive F in D that satisﬁes F = f . By the regularity theorem, we know that F is indeﬁnitely (and hence twice) complex diﬀerentiable, and therefore f is holomorphic.

5.2 Sequences of holomorphic functions
Theorem 5.2 If {fn}∞ n=1 is a sequence of holomorphic functions that converges uniformly to a function f in every compact subset of Ω, then f is holomorphic in Ω.
Proof. Let D be any disc whose closure is contained in Ω and T any triangle in that disc. Then, since each fn is holomorphic, Goursat’s theorem implies

fn(z) dz = 0 for all n.
T
By assumption fn → f uniformly in the closure of D, so f is continuous and

fn(z) dz → f (z) dz.

T

T

54

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

As a result, we ﬁnd T f (z) dz = 0, and by Morera’s theorem, we conclude that f is holomorphic in D. Since this conclusion is true for every D
whose closure is contained in Ω, we ﬁnd that f is holomorphic in all of
Ω.

This is a striking result that is obviously not true in the case of real variables: the uniform limit of continuously diﬀerentiable functions need not be diﬀerentiable. For example, we know that every continuous function on [0, 1] can be approximated uniformly by polynomials, by Weierstrass’s theorem (see Chapter 5, Book I), yet not every continuous function is diﬀerentiable.
We can go one step further and deduce convergence theorems for the sequence of derivatives. Recall that if f is a power series with radius of convergence R, then f can be obtained by diﬀerentiating term by term the series for f , and moreover f has radius of convergence R. (See Theorem 2.6 in Chapter 1.) This implies in particular that if Sn are the partial sums of f , then Sn converges uniformly to f on every compact subset of the disc of convergence of f . The next theorem generalizes this fact.

Theorem 5.3 Under the hypotheses of the previous theorem, the sequence of derivatives {fn}∞ n=1 converges uniformly to f on every compact subset of Ω.

Proof. We may assume without loss of generality that the sequence of functions in the theorem converges uniformly on all of Ω. Given δ > 0, let Ωδ denote the subset of Ω deﬁned by

Ωδ = {z ∈ Ω : Dδ(z) ⊂ Ω}.

In other words, Ωδ consists of all points in Ω which are at distance > δ from its boundary. To prove the theorem, it suﬃces to show that {fn} converges uniformly to f on Ωδ for each δ. This is achieved by proving the following inequality:

1

(13)

sup |F (z)| ≤ sup |F (ζ)|

z∈Ωδ

δ ζ∈Ω

whenever F is holomorphic in Ω, since it can then be applied to F = fn − f to prove the desired fact. The inequality (13) follows at once from the Cauchy integral formula and the deﬁnition of Ωδ, since for every z ∈ Ωδ the closure of Dδ(z) is contained in Ω and

F (z) = 2πi

Of course, there is nothing special about the ﬁrst derivative, and in fact under the hypotheses of the last theorem, we may conclude (arguing as above) that for every k ≥ 0 the sequence of kth derivatives {fn(k)}∞ n=1 converges uniformly to f (k) on every compact subset of Ω.
In practice, one often uses Theorem 5.2 to construct holomorphic functions (say, with a prescribed property) as a series

∞

(14)

F (z) = fn(z).

n=1

Indeed, if each fn is holomorphic in a given region Ω of the complex plane, and the series converges uniformly in compact subsets of Ω, then Theorem 5.2 guarantees that F is also holomorphic in Ω. For instance, various special functions are often expressed in terms of a converging series like (14). A speciﬁc example is the Riemann zeta function discussed in Chapter 6.
We now turn to a variant of this idea, which consists of functions deﬁned in terms of integrals.

5.3 Holomorphic functions deﬁned in terms of integrals
As we shall see later in this book, a number of other special functions are deﬁned in terms of integrals of the type
b
f (z) = F (z, s) ds,
a
or as limits of such integrals. Here, the function F is holomorphic in the ﬁrst argument, and continuous in the second. The integral is taken in the sense of Riemann integration over the bounded interval [a, b]. The problem then is to establish that f is holomorphic.

56

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

In the next theorem, we impose a suﬃcient condition on F , often satisﬁed in practice, that easily implies that f is holomorphic.
After a simple linear change of variables, we may assume that a = 0 and b = 1.

Theorem 5.4 Let F (z, s) be deﬁned for (z, s) ∈ Ω × [0, 1] where Ω is an open set in C. Suppose F satisﬁes the following properties:

(i) F (z, s) is holomorphic in z for each s.

(ii) F is continuous on Ω × [0, 1].

Then the function f deﬁned on Ω by

is holomorphic.

1
f (z) = F (z, s) ds
0

The second condition says that F is jointly continuous in both arguments.
To prove this result, it suﬃces to prove that f is holomorphic in any disc D contained in Ω, and by Morera’s theorem this could be achieved by showing that for any triangle T contained in D we have

1
F (z, s) ds dz = 0.
T0
Interchanging the order of integration, and using property (i) would then yield the desired result. We can, however, get around the issue of justifying the change in the order of integration by arguing diﬀerently. The idea is to interpret the integral as a “uniform” limit of Riemann sums, and then apply the results of the previous section.
Proof. For each n ≥ 1, we consider the Riemann sum

n
fn(z) = (1/n) F (z, k/n).
k=1

Then fn is holomorphic in all of Ω by property (i), and we claim that on any disc D whose closure is contained in Ω, the sequence {fn}∞ n=1 converges uniformly to f . To see this, we recall that a continuous function
on a compact set is uniformly continuous, so if > 0 there exists δ > 0
such that

sup |F (z, s1) − F (z, s2)| <
z∈D

whenever |s1 − s2| < δ.

5. Further applications

57

Then, if n > 1/δ, and z ∈ D we have

n k/n

|fn(z) − f (z)| =

F (z, k/n) − F (z, s) ds

k=1 (k−1)/n

n k/n

≤

|F (z, k/n) − F (z, s)| ds

k=1 (k−1)/n

<.

This proves the claim, and by Theorem 5.2 we conclude that f is holomorphic in D. As a consequence, f is holomorphic in Ω, as was to be shown.

5.4 Schwarz reﬂection principle
In real analysis, there are various situations where one wishes to extend a function from a given set to a larger one. Several techniques exist that provide extensions for continuous functions, and more generally for functions with varying degrees of smoothness. Of course, the diﬃculty of the technique increases as we impose more conditions on the extension.
The situation is very diﬀerent for holomorphic functions. Not only are these functions indeﬁnitely diﬀerentiable in their domain of deﬁnition, but they also have additional characteristically rigid properties, which make them diﬃcult to mold. For example, there exist holomorphic functions in a disc which are continuous on the closure of the disc, but which cannot be continued (analytically) into any region larger than the disc. (This phenomenon is discussed in Problem 1.) Another fact we have seen above is that holomorphic functions must be identically zero if they vanish on small open sets (or even, for example, a non-zero line segment).
It turns out that the theory developed in this chapter provides a simple extension phenomenon that is very useful in applications: the Schwarz reﬂection principle. The proof consists of two parts. First we deﬁne the extension, and then check that the resulting function is still holomorphic. We begin with this second point.
Let Ω be an open subset of C that is symmetric with respect to the real line, that is
z ∈ Ω if and only if z ∈ Ω.

Also, let I = Ω ∩ R so that I denotes the interior of that part of the boundary of Ω+ and Ω− that lies on the real axis. Then we have
Ω+ ∪ I ∪ Ω− = Ω

and the only interesting case of the next theorem occurs, of course, when I is non-empty.
Theorem 5.5 (Symmetry principle) If f + and f − are holomorphic functions in Ω+ and Ω− respectively, that extend continuously to I and

disc centered at a point on I and entirely contained in Ω. We prove that f is holomorphic in D by Morera’s theorem. Suppose T is a triangle in D. If T does not intersect I, then

f (z) dz = 0
T
since f is holomorphic in the upper and lower half-discs. Suppose now that one side or vertex of T is contained in I, and the rest of T is in, say, the upper half-disc. If T is the triangle obtained from T by slightly raising the edge or vertex which lies on I, we have T f = 0 since T is entirely contained in the upper half-disc (an illustration of the case when an edge lies on I is given in Figure 12(a)). We then let → 0, and by continuity we conclude that

f (z) dz = 0.

If the interior of T intersects I, we can reduce the situation to the previous one by writing T as the union of triangles each of which has an edge or vertex on I as shown in Figure 12(b). By Morera’s theorem we conclude that f is holomorphic in D, as was to be shown.
We can now state the extension principle, where we use the above notation.

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

Theorem 5.6 (Schwarz reﬂection principle) Suppose that f is a holomorphic function in Ω+ that extends continuously to I and such that f is real-valued on I. Then there exists a function F holomorphic in all of Ω such that F = f on Ω+.
Proof. The idea is simply to deﬁne F (z) for z ∈ Ω− by

F (z) = f (z).
To prove that F is holomorphic in Ω− we note that if z, z0 ∈ Ω−, then z, z0 ∈ Ω+ and hence, the power series expansion of f near z0 gives
f (z) = an(z − z0)n.

As a consequence we see that

F (z) = an(z − z0)n

and F is holomorphic in Ω−. Since f is real valued on I we have f (x) = f (x) whenever x ∈ I and hence F extends continuously up to I. The proof is complete once we invoke the symmetry principle.

5.5 Runge’s approximation theorem

We know by Weierstrass’s theorem that any continuous function on a

compact interval can be approximated uniformly by polynomials.4 With

this result in mind, one may inquire about similar approximations in

complex analysis. More precisely, we ask the following question: what

conditions on a compact set K ⊂ C guarantee that any function holo-

morphic in a neighborhood of this set can be approximated uniformly by

polynomials on K?

An example of this is provided by power series expansions. We recall

that if f is a holomorphic function in a disc D, then it has a power series

expansion f (z) =

∞ n=0

anzn

that

converges

uniformly

on

every

compact

set K ⊂ D. By taking partial sums of this series, we conclude that f can

be approximated uniformly by polynomials on any compact subset of D.

In general, however, some condition on K must be imposed, as we see

by considering the function f (z) = 1/z on the unit circle K = C. Indeed,

recall that C f (z) dz = 2πi, and if p is any polynomial, then Cauchy’s theorem implies C p(z) dz = 0, and this quickly leads to a contradiction.

4A proof may be found in Section 1.8, Chapter 5, of Book I.

5. Further applications

61

A restriction on K that guarantees the approximation pertains to the topology of its complement: Kc must be connected. In fact, a slight modiﬁcation of the above example when f (z) = 1/z proves that this condition on K is also necessary; see Problem 4.
Conversely, uniform approximations exist when Kc is connected, and this result follows from a theorem of Runge which states that for any K a uniform approximation exists by rational functions with “singularities” in the complement of K.5 This result is remarkable since rational functions are globally deﬁned, while f is given only in a neighborhood of K. In particular, f could be deﬁned independently on diﬀerent components of K, making the conclusion of the theorem even more striking.

Theorem 5.7 Any function holomorphic in a neighborhood of a compact
set K can be approximated uniformly on K by rational functions whose singularities are in Kc.
If Kc is connected, any function holomorphic in a neighborhood of K
can be approximated uniformly on K by polynomials.

We shall see how the second part of the theorem follows from the ﬁrst: when Kc is connected, one can “push” the singularities to inﬁnity thereby transforming the rational functions into polynomials.
The key to the theorem lies in an integral representation formula that is a simple consequence of the Cauchy integral formula applied to a square.

Lemma 5.8 Suppose f is holomorphic in an open set Ω, and K ⊂ Ω is compact. Then, there exists ﬁnitely many segments γ1, . . . , γN in Ω − K such that

(15) Proof.

for all z ∈ K.

√ Let d = c · d(K, Ωc), where c is any constant < 1/ 2, and

consider a grid formed by (solid) squares with sides parallel to the axis

and of length d.

We let Q = {Q1, . . . , QM } denote the ﬁnite collection of squares in

this grid that intersect K, with the boundary of each square given the

positive orientation. (We denote by ∂Qm the boundary of the square Qm.) Finally, we let γ1, . . . , γN denote the sides of squares in Q that do not belong to two adjacent squares in Q. (See Figure 13.) The choice of

d guarantees that for each n, γn ⊂ Ω, and γn does not intersect K; for if it did, then it would belong to two adjacent squares in Q, contradicting

our choice of γn.

5These singularities are points where the function is not holomorphic, and are “poles”, as deﬁned in the next chapter.

62

Chapter 2. CAUCHY’S THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS

Since for any z ∈ K that is not on the boundary of a square in Q there exists j so that z ∈ Qj, Cauchy’s theorem implies

dζ =

2πi ∂Qm ζ − z

However, if Qm and Qm are adjacent, the integral over their common side is taken once in each direction, and these cancel. This establishes (15) when z is in K and not on the boundary of a square in Q. Since γn ⊂ Kc, continuity guarantees that this relation continues to hold for all z ∈ K, as was to be shown.

The ﬁrst part of Theorem 5.7 is therefore a consequence of the next lemma.

Lemma 5.9 For any line segment γ entirely contained in Ω − K, there exists a sequence of rational functions with singularities on γ that approximate the integral γ f (ζ)/(ζ − z) dζ uniformly on K.
Proof. If γ(t) : [0, 1] → C is a parametrization for γ, then

5. Further applications

63

Since γ does not intersect K, the integrand F (z, t) in this last integral is jointly continuous on K × [0, 1], and since K is compact, given > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that

sup |F (z, t1) − F (z, t2)| <
z∈K

whenever |t1 − t2| < δ.

Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 5.4, we see that the Riemann sums

of the integral

approximate it

uniformly on

K.

Since

each

of these Riemann sums is a rational function with singularities on γ, the

lemma is proved.

Finally, the process of pushing the poles to inﬁnity is accomplished by using the fact that Kc is connected. Since any rational function whose only singularity is at the point z0 is a polynomial in 1/(z − z0), it suﬃces to establish the next lemma to complete the proof of Theorem 5.7.

Lemma 5.10 If Kc is connected and z0 ∈/ K, then the function 1/(z − z0) can be approximated uniformly on K by polynomials.

Proof. First, we choose a point z1 that is outside a large open disc D centered at the origin and which contains K. Then

where the series converges uniformly for z ∈ K. The partial sums of

this series are polynomials that provide a uniform approximation to

1/(z − z1) on K. In particular, this implies that any power 1/(z − z1)k

can also be approximated uniformly on K by polynomials.

It now suﬃces to prove that 1/(z − z0) can be approximated uniformly on K by polynomials in 1/(z − z1). To do so, we use the fact that Kc is connected to travel from z0 to the point z1. Let γ be a curve in Kc that

is parametrized by γ(t) on [0, 1], and such that γ(0) = z0 and γ(1) = z1.

We

choose a sequence of points {w1, . . . , w } on γ such that w0 = z0, w = z1,

and |wj − wj+1| < ρ for all 0 ≤ j < .

We claim that if w is a point on γ, and w any other point with

|w − w | < ρ, then 1/(z − w) can be approximated uniformly on K by

polynomials in 1/(z − w ). To see this, note that

and since the sum converges uniformly for z ∈ K, the approximation by partial sums proves our claim.
This result allows us to travel from z0 to z1 through the ﬁnite sequence {wj} to ﬁnd that 1/(z − z0) can be approximated uniformly on K by polynomials in 1/(z − z1). This concludes the proof of the lemma, and also that of the theorem.

3 Meromorphic Functions and the Logarithm
One knows that the diﬀerential calculus, which has contributed so much to the progress of analysis, is founded on the consideration of diﬀerential coeﬃcients, that is derivatives of functions. When one attributes an inﬁnitesimal increase to the variable x, the function f (x) of this variable undergoes in general an inﬁnitesimal increase of which the ﬁrst term is proportional to , and the ﬁnite coeﬃcient of of this increase is what is called its diﬀerential coeﬃcient... If considering the values of x where f (x) becomes inﬁnite, we add to one of these values designated by x1, the inﬁnitesimal , and then develop f (x1 + ) in increasing power of the same quantity, the ﬁrst terms of this development contain negative powers of ; one of these will be the product of 1/ with a ﬁnite coefﬁcient, which we will call the residue of the function f (x), relative to the particular value x1 of the variable x. Residues of this kind present themselves naturally in several branches of algebraic and inﬁnitesimal analysis. Their consideration furnish methods that can be simply used, that apply to a large number of diverse questions, and that give new formulae that would seem to be of interest to mathematicians...
A. L. Cauchy, 1826
There is a general principle in the theory, already implicit in Riemann’s work, which states that analytic functions are in an essential way characterized by their singularities. That is to say, globally analytic functions are “eﬀectively” determined by their zeros, and meromorphic functions by their zeros and poles. While these assertions cannot be formulated as precise general theorems, there are nevertheless signiﬁcant instances where this principle applies.
We begin this chapter by considering singularities, in particular the diﬀerent kind of point singularities (“isolated” singularities) that a holomorphic function can have. In order of increasing severity, these are:
• removable singularities

72

Chapter 3. MEROMORPHIC FUNCTIONS AND THE LOGARITHM

• poles
• essential singularities.
The ﬁrst type is harmless since a function can actually be extended to be holomorphic at its removable singularities (hence the name). Near the third type, the function oscillates and may grow faster than any power, and a complete understanding of its behavior is not easy. For the second type the analysis is more straight forward and is connected with the calculus of residues, which arises as follows.
Recall that by Cauchy’s theorem a holomorphic function f in an open set which contains a closed curve γ and its interior satisﬁes

f (z) dz = 0.
γ
The question that occurs is: what happens if f has a pole in the interior of the curve? To try to answer this question consider the example f (z) = 1/z, and recall that if C is a (positively oriented) circle centered at 0, then
dz = 2πi.
Cz
This turns out to be the key ingredient in the calculus of residues.
A new aspect appears when we consider indeﬁnite integrals of holomorphic functions that have singularities. As the basic example f (z) = 1/z shows, the resulting “function” (in this case the logarithm) may not be single-valued, and understanding this phenomenon is of importance for a number of subjects. Exploiting this multi-valuedness leads in eﬀect to the “argument principle.” We can use this principle to count the number of zeros of a holomorphic function inside a suitable curve. As a simple consequence of this result, we obtain a signiﬁcant geometric property of holomorphic functions: they are open mappings. From this, the maximum principle, another important feature of holomorphic functions, is an easy step.
In order to turn to the logarithm itself, and come to grips with the precise nature of its multi-valuedness, we introduce the notions of homotopy of curves and simply connected domains. It is on the latter type of open sets that single-valued branches of the logarithm can be deﬁned.

1 Zeros and poles
By deﬁnition, a point singularity of a function f is a complex number z0 such that f is deﬁned in a neighborhood of z0 but not at the point

1. Zeros and poles

z0 itself. We shall also call such points isolated singularities. For example, if the function f is deﬁned only on the punctured plane by f (z) = z, then the origin is a point singularity. Of course, in that case, the function f can actually be deﬁned at 0 by setting f (0) = 0, so that the resulting extension is continuous and in fact entire. (Such points are then called removable singularities.) More interesting is the case of the function g(z) = 1/z deﬁned in the punctured plane. It is clear now that g cannot be deﬁned as a continuous function, much less as a holomorphic function, at the point 0. In fact, g(z) grows to inﬁnity as z approaches 0, and we shall say that the origin is a pole singularity. Finally, the case of the function h(z) = e1/z on the punctured plane shows that removable singularities and poles do not tell the whole story. Indeed, the function h(z) grows indeﬁnitely as z approaches 0 on the positive real line, while h approaches 0 as z goes to 0 on the negative real axis. Finally h oscillates rapidly, yet remains bounded, as z approaches the origin on the imaginary axis.
Since singularities often appear because the denominator of a fraction vanishes, we begin with a local study of the zeros of a holomorphic function.
A complex number z0 is a zero for the holomorphic function f if f (z0) = 0. In particular, analytic continuation shows that the zeros of a non-trivial holomorphic function are isolated. In other words, if f is holomorphic in Ω and f (z0) = 0 for some z0 ∈ Ω, then there exists an open neighborhood U of z0 such that f (z) = 0 for all z ∈ U − {z0}, unless f is identically zero. We start with a local description of a holomorphic function near a zero.

Theorem 1.1 Suppose that f is holomorphic in a connected open set Ω, has a zero at a point z0 ∈ Ω, and does not vanish identically in Ω. Then there exists a neighborhood U ⊂ Ω of z0, a non-vanishing holomorphic function g on U , and a unique positive integer n such that

f (z) = (z − z0)ng(z) for all z ∈ U .

Proof. Since Ω is connected and f is not identically zero, we conclude that f is not identically zero in a neighborhood of z0. In a small disc centered at z0 the function f has a power series expansion

Since f is not identically zero near z0, there exists a smallest integer n

such that an = 0. Then, we can write f (z) = (z − z0)n[an + an+1(z − z0) + · · · ] = (z − z0)ng(z) ,

where g is deﬁned by the series in brackets, and hence is holomorphic, and is nowhere vanishing for all z close to z0 (since an = 0). To prove the uniqueness of the integer n, suppose that we can also write

f (z) = (z − z0)ng(z) = (z − z0)mh(z) where h(z0) = 0. If m > n, then we may divide by (z − z0)n to see that
g(z) = (z − z0)m−nh(z)

and letting z → z0 yields g(z0) = 0, a contradiction. If m < n a similar argument gives h(z0) = 0, which is also a contradiction. We conclude that m = n, thus h = g, and the theorem is proved.
In the case of the above theorem, we say that f has a zero of order n (or multiplicity n) at z0. If a zero is of order 1, we say that it is simple. We observe that, quantitatively, the order describes the rate at which the function vanishes.
The importance of the previous theorem comes from the fact that we can now describe precisely the type of singularity possessed by the function 1/f at z0.
For this purpose, it is now convenient to deﬁne a deleted neighborhood of z0 to be an open disc centered at z0, minus the point z0, that is, the set
{z : 0 < |z − z0| < r}

for some r > 0. Then, we say that a function f deﬁned in a deleted neighborhood of z0 has a pole at z0, if the function 1/f , deﬁned to be zero at z0, is holomorphic in a full neighborhood of z0.
Theorem 1.2 If f has a pole at z0 ∈ Ω, then in a neighborhood of that point there exist a non-vanishing holomorphic function h and a unique positive integer n such that
f (z) = (z − z0)−nh(z).
Proof. By the previous theorem we have 1/f (z) = (z − z0)ng(z), where g is holomorphic and non-vanishing in a neighborhood of z0, so the result follows with h(z) = 1/g(z).

1. Zeros and poles

75

The integer n is called the order (or multiplicity) of the pole, and describes the rate at which the function grows near z0. If the pole is of order 1, we say that it is simple.
The next theorem should be reminiscent of power series expansion, except that now we allow terms of negative order, to account for the presence of a pole.

is called the principal part of f at the pole z0, and the coeﬃcient a−1 is the residue of f at that pole. We write resz0f = a−1. The importance of the residue comes from the fact that all the other terms in the principal
part, that is, those of order strictly greater than 1, have primitives in a
deleted neighborhood of z0. Therefore, if P (z) denotes the principal part above and C is any circle centered at z0, we get

We shall return to this important point in the section on the residue formula.
As we shall see, in many cases, the evaluation of integrals reduces to the calculation of residues. In the case when f has a simple pole at z0, it is clear that

If the pole is of higher order, a similar formula holds, one that involves diﬀerentiation as well as taking a limit.

2 The residue formula
We now discuss the celebrated residue formula. Our approach follows the discussion of Cauchy’s theorem in the last chapter: we ﬁrst consider the case of the circle and its interior the disc, and then explain generalizations to toy contours and their interiors.
Theorem 2.1 Suppose that f is holomorphic in an open set containing a circle C and its interior, except for a pole at z0 inside C. Then

f (z) dz = 2πi resz0 f.
C
Proof. Once again, we may choose a keyhole contour that avoids the pole, and let the width of the corridor go to zero to see that

f (z) dz = f (z) dz

C

where C is the small circle centered at the pole z0 and of radius . Now we observe that

when k > 1, by using the corresponding formulae for the derivatives (Corollary 4.2 also in the previous chapter). But we know that in a neighborhood of z0 we can write

G(z),

where G is holomorphic. By Cauchy’s theorem, we also know that
C G(z) dz = 0, hence C f (z) dz = a−1. This implies the desired result.

This theorem can be generalized to the case of ﬁnitely many poles in the circle, as well as to the case of toy contours.

Corollary 2.2 Suppose that f is holomorphic in an open set containing a circle C and its interior, except for poles at the points z1, . . . , zN inside C. Then

N

f (z) dz = 2πi reszk f.

C

k=1

For the proof, consider a multiple keyhole which has a loop avoiding each one of the poles. Let the width of the corridors go to zero. In the limit, the integral over the large circle equals a sum of integrals over small circles to which Theorem 2.1 applies.

Corollary 2.3 Suppose that f is holomorphic in an open set containing a toy contour γ and its interior, except for poles at the points z1, . . . , zN inside γ. Then

N

f (z) dz = 2πi reszk f.

k=1

In the above, we take γ to have positive orientation.

The proof consists of choosing a keyhole appropriate for the given toy

contour, so that, as we have seen previously, we can reduce the situation

to integrating over small circles around the poles where Theorem 2.1

applies.

2.1 Examples
The calculus of residues provides a powerful technique to compute a wide range of integrals. In the examples we give next, we evaluate three

Chapter 3. MEROMORPHIC FUNCTIONS AND THE LOGARITHM

improper Riemann integrals of the form

∞
f (x) dx.
−∞

The main idea is to extend f to the complex plane, and then choose a family γR of toy contours so that

∞

lim f (z) dz = f (x) dx.

R→∞ γR

−∞

By computing the residues of f at its poles, we easily obtain γR f (z) dz. The challenging part is to choose the contours γR, so that the above limit holds. Often, this choice is motivated by the decay behavior of f .

Example 1. First, we prove that

∞ dx

(2)

−∞ 1 + x2 = π

by using contour integration. Note that if we make the change of variables x → x/y, this yields

1 ∞ y dx

∞

π

−∞ y2 + x2 =

Py(x) dx.
−∞

In other words, formula (2) says that the integral of the Poisson kernel Py(x) is equal to 1 for each y > 0. This was proved quite easily in Lemma 2.5 of Chapter 5 in Book I, since 1/(1 + x2) is the derivative of arctan x. Here we provide a residue calculation that leads to another proof of (2).
Consider the function
1 f (z) = 1 + z2 ,

which is holomorphic in the complex plane except for simple poles at the points i and −i. Also, we choose the contour γR shown in Figure 1. The contour consists of the segment [−R, R] on the real axis and of a large half-circle centered at the origin in the upper half-plane. Since we may write
1 f (z) = (z − i)(z + i)

2. The residue formula

If we denote by CR+ the large half-circle of radius R, we see that

where we have used the fact that |f (z)| ≤ B/|z|2 when z ∈ CR+ and R is large. So this integral goes to 0 as R → ∞. Therefore, in the limit we ﬁnd that

f (x) dx = π,
−∞

as desired. We remark that in this example, there is nothing special about our choice of the semicircle in the upper half-plane. One gets the same conclusion if one uses the semicircle in the lower half-plane, with the other pole and the appropriate residue.

Example 2. An integral that will play an important role in Chapter 6

is

To prove this formula, let f (z) = eaz/(1 + ez), and consider the contour consisting of a rectangle in the upper half-plane with a side lying

on the real axis, and a parallel side on the line Im(z) = 2π, as shown in Figure 2.
The only point in the rectangle γR where the denominator of f vanishes is z = πi. To compute the residue of f at that point, we argue as follows: First, note

(z

We recognize on the right the inverse of a diﬀerence quotient, and in fact

lim

ez z

−1

since ez is its own derivative. Therefore, the function f has a simple pole at πi with residue

resπif = −eaπi.

As a consequence, the residue formula says that

(3)

f = −2πieaπi.

γR

We now investigate the integrals of f over each side of the rectangle. Let IR denote
R
f (x) dx
−R

and I the integral we wish to compute, so that IR → I as R → ∞. Then, it is clear that the integral of f over the top side of the rectangle (with

2. The residue formula

the orientation from right to left) is

−e2πiaIR.

Finally, if AR = {R + it : 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π} denotes the vertical side on the right, then

f
AR

≤

2π 0

ea(R+it) 1 + eR+it

dt ≤ Ce(a−1)R,

and since a < 1, this integral tends to 0 as R → ∞. Similarly, the integral over the vertical segment on the left goes to 0, since it can be bounded by Ce−aR and a > 0. Therefore, in the limit as R tends to inﬁnity, the
identity (3) yields

I − e2πiaI = −2πieaπi ,

from which we deduce

eaπi I = −2πi 1 − e2πia

2πi = eπia − e−πia

and the computation is complete.

In other words, the function 1/ cosh πx is its own Fourier transform, a property also shared by e−πx2 (see Example 1, Chapter 2). To see this, we use a rectangle γR as shown on Figure 3 whose width goes to inﬁnity, but whose height is ﬁxed.
For a ﬁxed ξ ∈ R, let
