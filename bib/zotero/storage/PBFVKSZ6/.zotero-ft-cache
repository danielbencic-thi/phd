Abstract: A system that can ﬂy off and touches down to execute particular tasks is a ﬂying robot. Nowadays, these ﬂying robots are capable of ﬂying without human control and make decisions according to the situation with the help of onboard sensors and controllers. Among ﬂying robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are highly attractive and applicable for military and civilian purposes. These applications require motion planning of UAVs along with collision avoidance protocols to get better robustness and a faster convergence rate to meet the target. Further, the optimization algorithm improves the performance of the system and minimizes the convergence error. In this survey, diverse scholarly articles were gathered to highlight the motion planning for UAVs that use bio-inspired algorithms. This study will assist researchers in understanding the latest work done in the motion planning of UAVs through various optimization techniques. Moreover, this review presents the contributions and limitations of every article to show the effectiveness of the proposed work.
Keywords: unmanned aerial vehicle; motion planning; optimization techniques
1. Introduction Flourishing high-tech innovations are making aerial robots an integral part of our
daily lives. There are extensive research and analyses on ﬂying robots that possess the mobility given by ﬂight [1,2]. Among these, Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) are vastly used ﬂying robots due to these distinguishing advantages over others, i.e., budget-friendly, small-sized, lighter in weight, and portable. Moreover, the state-of-the-art characteristics of UAVs are position controlling, sensor employment, auto-level application, structure monitoring, etc. [3–5]. It also has a diverse array of applications, whether in the military or civilian sectors [6]. There are two primary models of UAVs; one is ﬁxed-wing, and the other one is multi-rotor UAVs. The essentials of UAV performance are higher in complex tasks or uncertain environments. Usually, a single UAV has a small size, which limits its volume of sensing, communication, and computation [7]. Thus, cooperative UAVs working together have more beneﬁts and potential results in comparison to a single UAV [8]. A few of them are cost and operation time reduction, low failure of missions, and achievement of higher ﬂexibility, survivability, conﬁgurability, and multi-tasks capability [9].
Background: It is one of the utmost evolving technologies from the 18th century and is advancing till now. At ﬁrst, in 1849, Montgolﬁer’s French brothers and Austrians employed unmanned balloons ﬁlled with bombs [10]. The development of UAVs with cameras occurred in 1860, which helped with vigilance [11]. In 1917, Charles F. Kettering invented an Aerial Torpedo and named unmanned balloons bugs. The Royal Navy tested a radiocontrolled pilotless aircraft during the 1930s [12]. The 1940s were marked by operation

Aphrodite, in which a formation of UAVs with handheld control took place for the ﬁrst time and radio control-based Queen Bee was developed. A few of them were Pioneer, Predator, Ryan ﬁre bee, etc. In 2003, Amazon started using UAVs commercially [13].
Related Work: Extensive analysis of various core issues on UAVs related to motion planning under different circumstances and environments [14]. To design motion control protocols and select path planning techniques, many problems and factors require serious considerations [15]. Numerous researchers have proposed distributed consensus-based motion controls for results with efﬁcacy and accuracy. Some developed leader-follower strategies for efﬁcient outcomes [16]. Some analyses have used bio-inspired algorithms for better path planning with minimal run time. Many employed hybrid algorithms for optimal path planning and achieved a reduction in cost and convergence time [17].
Motivation and Contribution: The motivation for this paper is to assemble various strategies used in different research together in a single place. This will help researchers select the best strategy for their required missions while comparing the explorations and exploitations of all the strategies. To overcome the hurdles of different limitations, uncertain disturbances, and complexities, appropriate strategies are essential. This makes the system more stable and efﬁcient and reduces the convergence rate and cost. The prime contributions of this review paper are:
A. The evaluation of the challenges faced by UAVs under different scenarios. B. Summarizing various promising motion planning techniques and algorithms for
determining the optimum path for UAVs. C. To gather the contributions and limitations presented in each article.
This review is based on the research studies and publications from reputed authors in the ﬁeld of motion planning techniques used for UAVs over the last three years.
Organization: The layout of this paper has many sections, of which Section 2 discusses the challenges that a UAV faces. Section 3 reviews recent developments in motion control and path planning mechanisms. Section 4 evaluates the motion planning and optimization algorithms. Section 5 presents the discussion. Section 6 provides the conclusion, and Section 7 gives directions for future work.
2. Challenges in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
There are extensive investigations regarding UAVs, but still, they face various challenges. The prime challenges that all the researchers face include the selection of UAVs with appropriate path planning that is suitable for the mission [18]. Then, forming efﬁcient motion control and achieves optimal path planning. Moreover, employing proper techniques for navigation and communication so that obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance are possible. Along with this certiﬁcation, regulation and human-machine interface issues are of much importance. Below are some of the challenges that require serious consideration:
2.1. Navigation and Guidance
UAVs have to track their mobility by measuring their distances, making maps, and sensing physical surroundings. To determine the positions of aerial robots, it is essential to develop a navigation system, which is automatic and does not require human interventions [19]. These robots are for ﬂying at higher altitudes and under different environments and hazards. Therefore, the safety and reliability of the system to operate properly are major challenges.
2.2. Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
The navigation of UAVs is much inﬂuenced by obstacles and collisions. Providing UAVs with an ideal environment is not a viable option. Obstacles that come in the path can be avoided. Moreover, the performances of multiple aerial robots are more beneﬁcial and efﬁcient than a single ﬂying robot. Working in groups can result in collisions. UAVs must be furnished with algorithms or techniques that can handle these issues [20].

2.2. Obstacle Detection and Avoidance The navigation of UAVs is much influenced by obstacles and collisions. Providing
UAVs with an ideal environment is not a viable option. Obstacles that come in the path can be avoided. Moreover, the performances of multiple aerial robots are more beneficial and efficient than a single flying robot. Working in groups can result in collisions. UA3Vosf 22 must be furnished with algorithms or techniques that can handle these issues [20].

3. Recent Developments in UAVs
UAV technology is expanding due to technological innovations. UAVs are becoming more affordable and easy to use, which enhances their application in diverse areas [6]. This paper reviews the strength and development of navigation, communication, shape and size,

Drones 2022, 6, 126

collision avoidance, motion control methods, and path planning techniques. It deliberates how they provide solutions to challenging problems while making a considerable impact.
3.1. Developments in Navigation and Guidance of UAVs
Navigation technology is quite signiﬁcant for UAV ﬂight control. Various developed navigation technologies possess different features. Such as satellite, geometric, integrated, Doppler, and inertial navigations. Different purposes require different navigation technologies. The main navigation systems for UAVs are a tactical or medium range navigation system and a high-altitude long-endurance navigation system [25,26]. Development in navigation can be evaluated as:
D. High-performance Navigation with Data Fusion: Navigation uses a Kalman ﬁlter; China introduced a data fusion mechanism using this ﬁltering technology. This data fusion is improved by using AI technology. It helps to determine the ﬂight status and guarantees the normal ﬂight of UAVs.
E. New Inertial Navigation System: Many researchers rendered services to develop optical ﬁber inertial navigation and laser inertial navigation. Improvement was required by the industry. The widely used silicon micro resonant accelerometer helps in UAV navigation. It simpliﬁes the weight and volume, consumes less energy, and reﬁnes ﬂight pliability.
F. Intelligent Navigation Ability: An emergency navigation system utilizes various adaptive technologies along with mission characteristics and modes. Moreover, information technology is applied to boost the UAV technology and upgrade the navigation system.
3.2. Developments in Shape and Size of UAVs
Earlier, UAVs were applicable for military purposes only, but now they are used for various tasks. This is all due to the rapid progress in developing UAVs with a wide range of shapes and sizes [27]. Different UAVs are utilized for different purposes. According to physical types, we have ﬁxed-wing and multi-rotor UAVs.
Fixed-Wing UAVs: These UAVs possess only one long wing on any body’s side and require a runway or a broad and ﬂat area. These can consume less battery; therefore, they can stay in the air for maximum hours. They are widely used for long-distance purposes, especially for military surveillance.
Multi-Rotor UAVs: These UAVs are built up with multiple propellers and rotors and do not require a runway for vertical ﬂying and landing. With more rotors, the position of UAVs can be controlled in a better way. Mostly quad-rotors are used for small and regularsized UAVs. Similarly, UAVs are classiﬁed based on their sizes into micro or mini-UAVs, tactical UAVs, strategic UAVs, and special-task UAVs.
Micro and Mini-UAVs: Many missions require small UAVs. Such as surveillance inside buildings, Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) sampling, the agricultural sector, and broadcast industries. Micro and mini-UAVs were developed for these purposes. The take-off weight of a micro-UAV is 0.1 kg, and a mini-UAV is less than 30 kg. Both ﬂy below 300 m with less than 2 h of endurance. The communication range is up to 10 km.
Tactical UAVs: Missions such as search and rescue operations, mine detection, communication relays, and NBC sampling use tactical UAVs. They can have a take-off weight of up to 1500 kg. Tactical UAVs can ﬂy up to 8000 m with an endurance of up to 48 h. The communication range is around 10–500 km.
Strategic UAVs: For airport security, communication relays, intercept vehicles, and RSTA, strategic UAVs are highly suitable. They can have a maximum take-off weight of around 12,500 kg. They can ﬂy up to 20,000 m with 48 h of endurance. The communication range is more than 2000 km.

3.3. Developments in Collision Avoidance of UAVs
A collision usually occurs between a UAV and its neighboring UAV or an obstacle whenever there is less distance between them. A collision avoidance system (CAS) makes sure that no collision takes place with any stationary or moving obstacle [28]. The CAS ﬁrst requires the perception phase and is then followed by the action phase.
Perception Phase: CAS detects an obstacle in this phase while utilizing various active or passive sensors according to their functionality principle. Active sensors possess their sources for wave emission or light transmission along with the receiver or detector. The most-used active sensors include radars, sonar, and LiDARs. All of these use minimum processing power, give a quick response, are less affected by weather, scan bigger portions in minimum time, and can return various parameters of the obstacles effectively. Whereas passive sensors are only capable of reading the emitted energy from another source such as the sun. Widely used passive sensors are visual or optical cameras and infrared (IR) or thermal cameras. The image formed by a visual camera requires visual light, whereas a thermal camera requires IR light.
Action Phase: This phase utilizes four prime strategies for collision avoidance. These are geometric, force-ﬁeld, optimized, and sense and avoid methods. The geometric approach utilizes the information about the location and velocity of the UAV along with its obstacle or neighbors. This is performed by trajectory simulation in which nodes are reformed for collision avoidance. In force-ﬁeld, the approach manipulates the attractive or repulsive forces to avoid collisions. In the optimized method, the parameters of obstacles, which are already known, are utilized for route optimization. In the sense and avoid technique, runtime decisions are made based on obstacle avoidance. The development in CAS helps in simple tasks by warning the vehicle operator and in complex tasks partially or completely controlling the system for collision avoidance.

3.4. Developments in Formation Control Protocols of UAVs

Formation control aims to generate control signals, which pilot UAVs to form a speciﬁc shape. Along with the architecture of motion control, the developed strategies for obtaining it are of much importance [29].
Formation Control Design: Motion controls of UAVs require a ﬂow of information within its team; therefore, it uses communication architectures.
There may be a lack of availability of global information in a single UAV for a whole operation. Due to its restricted capabilities to compute and communicate, centralized architecture is considered or used rarely. Decentralized architecture is preferred more for multi-UAV systems and uses the consensus algorithm technique for designing it. It is based on local interactions with the neighbors while maintaining a certain distance.
Formation Control Strategies: Various developed control approaches are discussed here that aid the researchers and possess certain beneﬁts and limitations. They are:

i.

Leader-Follower Strategy: As obvious from its title, this approach assigns one

UAV as a leader, while the remaining UAVs as followers in a group. The mission

information remains with the leader only while the followers chase their leader with

pre-designed spaces. The major beneﬁt of this strategy is that it can be implemented

simply and easily. Due to leader dependency, this strategy faces single-point failures.

This limitation can be compensated by assigning multi-leaders and virtual leaders.

ii. Behavior-based Strategy: This approach produces control signals, which consider

several mission essentials, by adding various vector functions. Its greatest merit

is that it is highly adaptable to any unknown environment. Its demerit is the

requirement to model it mathematically, which leads to difﬁculty in analyzing

system stabilities.

iii. Virtual Structure Strategy: This approach considers rigid structure for the desired

shape of the group of UAVs. To achieve the desired shape, there is a need to ﬂy each

UAV towards its corresponding virtual node. Abilities to maintain the formation

and fault-tolerance are its greatest advantages. This approach faces failure when the

Drones 2022, 6, 126

6 of 22

detection of a UAV is faulty in the formation. The compensation for this faulty UAV requires reconﬁguration of the formation shape. This approach calls for a strong ability to compute, which is a disadvantage of this approach.
3.5. Developments in Path Planning Techniques of UAVs
Path planning aims to design a ﬂight path towards a target with fewer chances of being demolished while facing limitations. Extensive research proposed different methods that overcome the path planning complexity of UAVs. To design algorithms for path planning, certain parameters, such as obstacles, the environment, and constraints, require selection with considerations [30]. The approaches employed for path planning have classiﬁcations based on their features and methodology.
4. Motion Planning and Optimization 4.1. Motion Planning
In robotics, motion planning refers to the act of dissolving a speciﬁed mobility goal into distinct motions. However, it is used to fulﬁll movement limitations while also potentially optimizing some components of the motion. However, motion planning is the challenge of planning for a vehicle that operates in areas with a high number of objects, performing actions to move through the environment as well as modify the conﬁguration of the objects [31]. Even though the motion planning situation has arisen in continuous C-space, the calculation is discrete. As a result, we need a means to “discretize” the problem if we want an algorithmic solution. As a result, there are mainly two types of planning, combinatorial planning and sampling-based planning.
4.1.1. Combinatorial Motion Planning
Combinatorial Motion Planning is a type of motion planning that involves more than one approach to achieve the task, as shown in Figure 2. Although combinatorial motion planning discovers the pathways through the continuous conﬁguration space, by using Drones 2022, 6, x FOR PEER REVIEWthese strategies, researchers obtain a better result. The effective combination of algor7ithomf 2s1 is commonly based on bio-inspired algorithms with different approaches.

(path) in C-space on which queries (start/goal configurations) can be solved, as show7 onf 2i2n Figure 3. To increase planner performance, we look at a variety of general-purpose strategies.

classifying these algorithms into further groups, we can label them as memetic algorithms. On the contrary, we can classify these algorithms into two categories, evolution-based algorithms and swarm-based algorithms [37].
A. Evolution-Based Algorithms
An evolution-based algorithm provides an optimal path for UAVs with consideration of three aspects. These aspects include travel distance, cost incurred, and path reliability cost to track that path. These evolutionary algorithms choose practical and achievable solutions randomly as the ﬁrst generation and consider the parameters later to explain which randomly selected feasible solutions are appropriate or not. For determining curved paths with essential aspects in 3D terrain; an ofﬂine path planner with an evolutionary algorithm is required [38]. By taking aspects into account, for example, beeline to destination, min-max distance related to targets, and topographical obstacles free tracks, one can display the B-spline curve as a ﬂying path. Some examples of these algorithms include Genetic algorithm (GA), Evolutionary Programming (EP), Evolutionary Strategy (ES), Differential Evolution algorithm (DE), and Harmony Search algorithm (HS).
GA gives the best optimal results in search space using three steps selection, crossover, and mutation. Besides its beneﬁts, sometimes it gives long and premature convergence and loses optimal results. Moreover, it is not applied to real-time data. In 1990, Fogel introduced a technique called EP. It reaches optimal results after many iterations. Similarly, another evolutionary algorithm is ES, which uses speciﬁed principles in optimization problems. DE employs real coding instead of binary coding. It reﬁnes the ﬁnal path while reducing the computational cost. The evolutionary algorithm that mimics a musician’s improvisation process is the HS algorithm. It shows promising results in optimization problems. It is further improved with various versions.
B. Swarm-Based Algorithms
Nature-based along with population-based algorithms evolved into swarm-based algorithms [39]. The swarm represents the combined behavior of all the agents. Agents in a swarm have limited capabilities, but working together, they achieve the given tasks while being at distances. As a result of which, fast, low cost, and optimal solutions are obtained even in the uncertainties and complexities. Some examples of these algorithms include Artiﬁcial Immune System (AIS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Bacteria Foraging Optimization algorithm (BFO), Cuckoo Search algorithm (CS), Artiﬁcial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC), Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO), Coral Reef Optimization algorithm (CRO), Teaching–Learning Based Optimization algorithm (TLBO), Fireﬂy algorithm (FA), Shufﬂed Frog Leaping algorithm (SFLA), and Pigeon-Inspired Optimization (PIO).
AIS is an intelligent swarm-based algorithm that is modeled on the natural principles of the immune system of humans. It has the characteristics of the immune system of memory and learning to utilize for solving problems. It gives adequate trajectories in path planning with less computation. The development of PSO is based on the mobility theory of an insect crowd. In the layout of this fact-ﬁnding approach, every solo particle in the crowd recognizes the points given by the last swarm and produces a velocity vector towards the target point. The key beneﬁt of this algorithm is that it is capable of obtaining optimal path planning in 3D, whereas its disadvantages are premature convergence and high time complexity. Passino introduced an algorithm based on the foraging behavior of Escherichia coli bacteria that lies in human intestines. He labeled this intelligent algorithm as BFO.
It provides rapid convergence and a global search. The CS algorithm replaces the average solutions and applies the solution that is potentially better. The ABC algorithm provides solutions to various optimization problems having constraints. The ACO algorithm is based on depositing characteristics of ants during food search and proved to be a meta-heuristic technique to derive the shortest path while dealing with continuous and multi-objective path planning issues. The CRO algorithm works efﬁciently with many advantages for difﬁcult optimization problems. The TLBO algorithm requires minimum

computational memory and can be employed easily. FA works efﬁciently for multimodal optimization problems. It ﬁnds the best location for UAVs with less energy consumption. SFLA depends on frogs’ clusters that are looking for food. It gathers the best frog, which can give local optimum and evolves the frog with inaccurate positions. It continues making iterations until the accomplishment of an optimal path with better convergence. PIO works via sharing information and striving among all to quickly achieve the optimal global solution.
C. Physical Algorithms
Heuristic algorithms that imitate physical laws and processes of nature are known as physical algorithms. These algorithms copy the physical conduct and characteristics of matter [40]. These are applicable for non-linear, high-dimensional, multimodal as well as complex optimization problems. There is very little research available on physical algorithms. These are categorized as Simulated Annealing (SA), Gravitational Search algorithm (GSA), Chaotic Optimization algorithm (COA), Intelligent Water Drops algorithm (IWD), and Magnetic Optimization algorithm (MOA). SA is suggested after a technique, annealing in metallurgy. It is employed for more complex computational optimization problems and gives approximate global optimum within a ﬁxed time. GSA is a newly introduced algorithm that mimics laws of motion and gravitational law. It is applied to optimization problems with various functions. COA is an easily implemented and powerful mechanism that can escape convergence to a local optimum within a short time. The IWD algorithm is based on how natural rivers can ﬁnd the best paths among many probable paths to their ultimate destination. MOA, a newly emerging algorithm, is derived from the basic principles of magnetism. The dual function of this algorithm can balance the disadvantages against the advantages in optimization problems.
D. Geographical Algorithms
The meta-heuristic algorithms that give random outcomes in geographical search space are labeled as geographical algorithms [41]. Some of the geographical algorithms are the Tabu Search algorithm (TS) and Imperialistic Competition algorithm (ICA). The TS algorithm determines an optimal solution among various feasible solutions. Its memory can recall the recent optimal solution and guide the search to trace the previous solutions. It is employed for optimization problems in various areas. Another geographical algorithm for the global best solution in optimization is ICA. It imitates sociopolitical imperialist competition. It involves imperialistic competition among empires along with assimilation and revolution of colonies and so on. Due to its robust searching ability, it provides many beneﬁts in optimization problems.
Among all the aforementioned algorithms, most are based on the swarm. These population-based algorithms are robust at obtaining better global solutions via their cooperative and self-adaptive abilities. These algorithms are employed for solving challenging issues of UAVs. This review paper gives details on a comparison of the aforesaid algorithms used for motion control and path planning of UAVs.
5. Related Review
To succeed, most motion planning approaches necessitate the use of appropriate optimization algorithms. These strategies can be used on a single UAV as well as a group of UAVs or a swarm of UAVs. When several UAV missions are viable for civilian objectives, a nature-inspired algorithm is required for control and optimization. Table 1 presents a detailed overview of the manuscripts related to motion planning problems of UAVs. The review also helps scholars with the optimization techniques applied to single or multiple UAVs.

6. Discussion
The most crucial challenge in the ﬁeld of UAVs is efﬁcient motion planning. It requires a state-of-the-art optimization method to counter issues. This research evaluates various challenges faced by UAVs and all the current designs of motion planning techniques. The recent developments discussed the results in high adaptable ability, cost and time reductions in task executions, energy efﬁciency, obstacles, and collision avoidance.
While reviewing various motion planning approaches, it became evident that most of the researchers preferred to use an optimization approach with nature-inspired algorithms. While discussing numerous categories of path planning strategies, it appears that hybrid algorithms give better performance. These improved and optimized algorithms overcome the limitations of numerical and analytical techniques. By analyzing the manuscript, it can be concluded that the best optimization approaches are swarm-based due to their exceptional ability to solve complex issues with their simpliﬁed approach.

7. Conclusions
UAVs are ﬂying machines that possess safe and task-oriented mobility in the presence of uncertainties with the help of modiﬁed techniques and the latest technological developments. The autonomous capability of these machines is also advancing and upgrading to provide efﬁcient ﬂying and stable formation in dynamic environments. However, motion planning issues in UAVs are most challenging among scholars. In this article, a detailed comparative study on the motion planning issues and achievements of UAVs has been presented, along with the limitations of each article. The study also presents recent challenges in all possible categories of UAVs to highlight the importance of UAVs in our society along with their developments and state-of-the-art work performed in the last 3 years.
8. Future Work
There is a very bound analysis in the comparison ﬁeld of motion planning and optimization algorithms that exists already and the determination of the best among them. To deploy the multiple UAV systems in a ﬁner way, various challenges and possibilities need more exploration, as well as a reduction in exploitations. Leads for future work are to model different swarm-based intelligent optimization approaches with high accuracy and efﬁciency and further feasible algorithms for 3D-path planning strategies.
