Abstract. We establish sharp upper bounds for the topological complexity TC(X) of motion planning algorithms in topological spaces X such that the fundamental group is “small”, i.e. when π1(X) is cyclic of order ≤ 3 or has cohomological dimension ≤ 2.

1. Introduction

Given a mechanical system, a motion planning algorithm is a function which assigns to any pair of states of the system, an initial state and a desired state, a continuous motion of the system starting at the initial state and ending at the desired state. Design of eﬀective motion planning algorithms is one of the challenges of modern robotics, see [12]. Motion planning algorithms are applicable in various situations when the system is autonomous and operates in a fully or partially known environment. As a typical example we can mention collision free control of many particles moving in space or along a graph, see [7].
The complexity of motion planning algorithms is measured by a numerical invariant TC(X) which depends on the homotopy type of the conﬁguration space X of the system [4]. This invariant is deﬁned as the Schwarz genus (also known under the term “sectional category”) of the path-space ﬁbration

(1)

p : P X → X × X.

Here P X is the space of all continuous paths γ : [0, 1] → X equipped with the compact-open topology and p(γ) = (γ(0), γ(1)) is the map associating to a path its pair of end points. TC(X) is the smallest integer k such that X × X admits an open cover U1 ∪ U2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uk = X × X with the property that there exists a continuous section of (1) Ui → P X for each i = 1, . . . , k. If X is an Euclidean neighborhood retract then TC(X) can be equivalently characterized as the minimal integer k such that there exists a section s : X × X → P X of ﬁbration

p with the property that X × X can be represented as the union of k mutually disjoint locally compact sets

X × X = G1 ∪ · · · ∪ Gk
such that the restriction s|Gi is continuous for i = 1, . . . , k, see [9], Proposition 4.2. A section s as above represents a motion planning algorithm: given a pair (A, B) ∈ X × X the image s(A, B) ∈ P X is a continuous motion of the system starting at the state A and ending at the state B.
Intuitively, the topological complexity TC(X) can be understood as a measure of the navigational complexity of the topological space X; it is the minimal number of continuous rules which are needed to describe a motion planning algorithm in X.
TC(X) admits an upper bound in terms of the dimension of the conﬁguration space X,

(2)

TC(X) ≤ 2 dim(X) + 1

see [4], Theorem 4. There are many examples when inequality (2) is sharp: take for instance X = T n♯T n, the connected sum of two copies
of a torus. However for any simply connected space X one has a more
powerful upper bound

(3)

TC(X) ≤ dim(X) + 1,

see [5]. The latter inequality is sharp for any simply connected closed symplectic manifold X, see [6]. Our goal in this paper is to establish results intermediate between (2) and (3) under various assumptions on the fundamental group π1(X). We start by stating the following theorem:

Theorem 1. Let X be a cell-complex with π1(X) = Z2. Then

(4)

TC(X) ≤ 2 dim(X).

Moreover, for a closed manifold X with π1(X) = Z2 one has

(5)

TC(X) ≤ 2 dim(X) − 1

assuming that wn = 0 where n = dim(X) and w ∈ H1(X; Z2) is the generator.

One knows that TC(RPn) ≤ 2n for all n (in consistence with (4)); moreover, TC(RPn) = 2n if and only if n is a power of 2, see Corollary 14 of [6].
Theorem 1 contrasts the related results for the Lusternik - Schnirelmann category cat(X). Recall that cat(X) denotes the smallest integer
k such that X admits an open cover X = V1 ∪· · ·∪Vk with the property

that each inclusion Vi → X is null-homotopic where i = 1, . . . , k. The general dimensional upper bound
cat(X) ≤ dim(X) + 1

is sharp for all real projective spaces. Theorem 3.5 of Berstein [1] states that for a closed connected n-dimensional manifold X with π1(X) = Z2 one has cat(X) = dim(X) + 1 if and only if wn = 0 ∈ Hn(X; Z2) where w ∈ H1(X; Z2) is the generator.
Theorem 1 raises questions about sharp upper bounds for TC(X) for spaces with other “small” fundamental groups. The case when π1(X) = Z3 is addressed by Theorem 2 below; the answer is quite diﬀerent from Theorem 1:

Theorem 2. Let X be a ﬁnite cell complex with π1(X) = Z3. (i) Assume that either dim X is odd or dim X = 2n is even and the
3-adic expansion of n contains at least one digit 2. Then,

(6)

TC(X) ≤ 2 dim(X).

(ii) For any integer n ≥ 1 having only the digits 0 and 1 in its 3adic expansion there exists a 2n-dimensional ﬁnite polyhedron X with π1(X) = Z3 and
TC(X) = 2 dim(X) + 1.

There are examples when inequality (6) of statement (i) is sharp. In paper [8] it is shown that for the lens space X = L32n+1 one has TC(X) = 2 dim(X) for any n having only digits 0 and 1 in its 3-adic expansion. Here L23n+1 is the factor space S2n+1/Z3 where Z3 = {1, ω, ω2} is the group of 3-roots of unity, ω = e2πi/3.
Next we mention the following result applicable to topological spaces
X with π1(X) of cohomological dimension ≤ 2:

Theorem 3. Let X be a ﬁnite cell complex such that the cohomological

dimension of its fundamental group does not exceed 2, cd(π1(X)) ≤ 2. Then one has

 

dim(X) + 2cd(π1(X)),

(7) TC(X) ≤

if dim(X) is odd,

 dim(X) + 2cd(π1(X)) + 1, if dim(X) is even.

Proof. This follows from a recent theorem of Dranishnikov [3] who studied related questions concerning Lusternik - Schnirelmann category. The theorem of Dranishnikov [3] states that for a cell complex X with fundamental group π1(X) of cohomological dimension not exceeding 2 one has

(8)

cat(X) ≤ ⌈(dim(X) − 1)/2⌉ + cd(π1(X)) + 1.

ARMINDO COSTA AND MICHAEL FARBER

Inequality (7) follows from (8) and from the inequality TC(X) ≤ 2 · cat(X) − 1,
see [4].

A conjecture, in the spirit the conjecture concerning cat(X) made by A. Dranishnikov in [3], states: There exists a function F : N → N such that for any cell-complex X one has
TC(X) ≤ dim(X) + F (cd(π1(X))).
Finally let us mention the following example. Let X be the ddimensional skeleton of a µ-dimensional torus T µ, i.e. X = (T µ)(d). Theorem 5.1 of Cohen and Pruidze [2] gives that TC(X) = 2d + 1, assuming that µ ≥ 2d ≥ 4. Hence in general an additional assumption that the fundamental group π1(X) is free abelian cannot help to improve the dimensional upper bound (2).

2. Necessary and sufficient condition for TC(X) ≤ 2 dim(X)

Given a connected cell complex X, we deﬁne below a local coeﬃcient system I over X × X and a canonical cohomology class

(9)

v = vX ∈ H1(X × X; I).

Denote by G = π1(X, x0) the fundamental group of X and by I = ker(ǫ) ⊂ Z[G] the kernel of the augmentation homomorphism
ǫ : Z[G] → Z. An element of I is a ﬁnite sum of the form nigi where ni ∈ Z, gi ∈ G, ni = 0. One can view I and Z[G] as left Z[G × G]-modules (i.e. as Z[G]-bimodules) via the action

(10)

(g, h) · nigi = ni(ggih−1), g, h ∈ G.

According to standard conventions (see [14], chap. 6), the left Z[G×G]modules I and Z[G] determine local coeﬃcient systems (denoted by I and Z[G] correspondingly) over X × X.
Consider a map f : G × G → I given by

(11)

f (g, h) = gh−1 − 1, g, h ∈ G.

It is a crossed homomorphism, i.e. it satisﬁes the identity f ((g, h)(g′, h′)) = f (g, h) + (g, h)f (g′h′)

where g, g′, h, h′ ∈ G. By Theorem 3.3 from chapter 6 of [14], f determines a one-dimensional cohomology class v ∈ H1(X × X; I).

Lemma 4. The restriction of the class v = vX to the diagonal X ⊂ X × X vanishes, i.e.

(12)

vX |X = 0 ∈ H1(X; I|X).

Proof. Indeed, the crossed homomorphism induced by f on the diagonal G ⊂ G × G is trivial, f (g, g) = 0 for all g ∈ G as follows from (11).

Note that the local system I|X corresponds to the augmentation ideal I viewed with the following left G-action
g · nigi = ni · (ggig−1),

where g, gi ∈ G and ni = 0. Here is another property of the class v = vX which is used later in
this paper:

Lemma 5. One has

vX = β(1) ∈ H1(X × X; I)

where

β : H0(X × X; Z) → H1(X × X; I)

is Bockstein homomorphism corresponding to the exact sequence of left Z[G × G]-modules

0 → I → Z[G] →ǫ Z → 0.

Proof. Let X˜ denote the universal cover of X and let x˜0 ∈ X˜ be a lift of the base point x0 ∈ X. Consider the singular chain complex S∗ = S∗(X˜ × X˜ ); we identify S0 with the free abelian group generated by the points of X˜ × X˜ . Recall that S∗ has a structure of a free left Z[G × G]-module. Consider a Z[G × G]-homomorphism k : S0(X˜ × X˜ ) → Z[G] associating an element of G with every point of X˜ × X˜ and such that k(x˜0, x˜0) = 1 ∈ G; then k(gx˜0, hx˜0) = gh−1. The cochain ǫ ◦ k : S0 → Z represents the class 1 ∈ H0(X × X; Z) and the Bockstein image β(1) ∈ H1(X × X; I) is represented by the composition
δ(k) : S1 →∂ S0 →k Z[G],
taking values in I. A crossed homomorphism f ′ : G × G → I associated to β(1) can be found as follows, see [14], chapter 6, §3. Given a pair (g, h) ∈ G × G = π1(X × X, (x0, x0)), realize it by a loop σ : ([0, 1], ∂[0, 1]) → (X × X, (x0, x0)), then lift σ to the covering σ˜ : ([0, 1], 0) → (X˜ × X˜ , (x˜0, x˜0)) and ﬁnally apply the cocycle δ(k) to σ˜, viewed as a singular 1-simplex in X˜ × X˜ . We obtain f ′(g, h) = k(gx˜0, hx˜0) − k(x˜0, x˜0) = gh−1 − 1 for all g, h ∈ G. This coincides with

6

ARMINDO COSTA AND MICHAEL FARBER

the crossed homomorphism describing vX , see (11). Hence β(1) = vX .
Corollary 6. The order of the class vX ∈ H1(X × X; I) equals the cardinality of the fundamental group |G| of X. In particular vX = 0 if and only if X is simply connected.

Proof. Consider the exact sequence
H0(X × X; I) → H0(X × X; Z[G]) →ǫ H0(X × X; Z) →β H1(X × X; I).
Note that H0(X × X; Z[G]) is isomorphic to the set of elements a = nigi ∈ Z[G] which are invariant with respect to G × G-action, see
[14], chapter 6, Theorem 3.2. Consider ﬁrst the case when G is inﬁnite. Then H0(X × X; Z[G]) = 0 as there are no invariant elements in the group ring. Since H0(X × X; Z) = Z this implies that in this case the class vX ∈ H1(X × X; I) generates an inﬁnite cyclic subgroup.
If G is ﬁnite then H0(X × X; I) = 0 (as above) and any G × Ginvariant element of Z[G] is a multiple of N = g∈G g. Hence the group H0(X × X; Z[G]) is inﬁnite cyclic generated by N and since ǫ(N) = |G|, the exact sequence

0 → H0(X × X; Z[G]) →ǫ H0(X × X; Z) →β H1(X × X; I)

turns into

0 → Z →|G| Z →β H1(X × X; I).

This shows that the subgroup of H1(X × X; I) generated by the class

vX is cyclic of order |G|.

The following result explains the key role the cohomology class v = vX plays in the theory of topological complexity.

Theorem 7. Let X be a cell complex of dimension n = dim(X) ≥ 2. One has

(13)

TC(X) ≤ 2n

if and only if the 2n-th power v2n = 0 ∈ H2n(X × X; I2n)
vanishes. Here I2n = I ⊗Z I ⊗Z · · ·⊗Z I denotes the tensor product over Z of 2n copies of I, viewed with the diagonal action of G × G, and v2n is the cup-product v ∪ v ∪ · · · ∪ v of 2n copies of v.

Proof. Consider the path space ﬁbration (1). The topological complexity TC(X) is deﬁned as the Schwarz genus of this ﬁbration. Consider also the 2n-fold ﬁberwise join p2n : P2nX → X × X of ﬁbration (1);

TOPOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY

this construction is described in detail in [13], chapter 2, §1. According to Theorem 3 of Schwarz [13], one has TC(X) ≤ 2n if and only the ﬁbration p2n has a continuous section. The ﬁbre F2n of p2n is the 2n-fold join ΩX ∗ ΩX ∗ · · · ∗ ΩX, where ΩX is the space of based loops in X. It follows that the ﬁbre F2n is (2n − 2)-connected and hence the primary obstruction
θ2n ∈ H2n(X × X; L2n), L2n = {π2n−1(F2n)} = {H2n−1(F2n)},
is the only obstruction to the existence of a continuous section of p2n: one has TC(X) ≤ 2n if and only if θ2n = 0. Note that the ﬁbre F2n is 2-connected since n ≥ 2. The symbol L2n = {H2n−1(F2n)} denotes a local system of homology groups of ﬁbres which associates with any point (x, y) ∈ X × X of the base the abelian group
L2(xn,y) = H2n−1(p−2n1(x, y))
and with any path σ : [0, 1] → X × X an isomorphism

(14)

σ∗ : L2σn(1) → L2σn(0)

deﬁned as follows. Given σ one applies the Homotopy Lifting Property to ﬁnd a map

(15)

K : p−2n1(σ(1)) × [0, 1] → P2nX

satisfying K(a, 1) = a and p2n(K(a, t)) = σ(t) for all a ∈ p−2n1(σ(1)) and t ∈ [0, 1]. Then a → K(a, 0) is a map p−2n1(σ(1)) → p−2n1(σ(0)) and (14) is the induced map on homology.
By Theorem 1 from [13] the local system L2n is the tensor power of

2n copies of a local system L,

L2n = L ⊗ L ⊗ · · · ⊗ L, (2n times)

and the obstruction θ2n is 2n-fold cup-product
θ2n = θ ∪ θ ∪ · · · ∪ θ (2n times), θ ∈ H1(X × X; L).
Here L is the local system L(x,y) = H˜0(p−1(x, y)) of reduced zero dimensional homology groups of ﬁbres of the initial ﬁbration (1) and θ ∈ H1(X × X; L) is “the homological obstruction” to the existence of a continuous section of (1) over the 1-skeleton of X × X. Theorem 7 follows once we are able to identify the local systems L and I so that θ = v ∈ H1(X × X; I).
Let x0 ∈ X the base point. The ﬁber p−1(x0, x0) is the space ΩX of all loops in X based at x0. Path-connected components of the ﬁbre are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of of the fundamental group π1(X, x0) = G. We see that H0(p−1(x0, x0)) = Z[G] and

8

ARMINDO COSTA AND MICHAEL FARBER

L(x0,x0) = H˜0(p−1(x0, x0)) = I = ker(ǫ). Next we show that the monodromy on I acts according to (10). Given a path σ : [0, 1] → X × X, where σ(t) = (α(t), β(t)), with σ(0) = σ(1) = (x0, x0), we may deﬁne a homotopy
Kσ : p−1(x0, x0) × [0, 1] → P X
similar to (15) by the formula:

where ω ∈ p−1(x0, x0) = ΩX and t, τ ∈ [0, 1]. One has K(ω, 1) = ω and p(K(ω, τ )) = σ(τ ). The monodromy action ΩX → ΩX along σ is

given by

(16)

ω → Kσ(ω, 0) = αωβ¯;

here β¯ denotes the inverse loop to β. We see that this map induces on H˜0(ΩX) the monodromy action (10) and therefore I and L coincide as
local coeﬃcient systems. Finally we show that the homological obstruction θ ∈ H1(X × X; I)

equals v. Without loss of generality we may assume that X has a

single zero-dimensional cell x0. Let ω0 be the constant loop at x0; this deﬁnes a section over the 0-skeleton. The homological obstruction

associates with any oriented 1-cell of X × X the formal diﬀerence, in H˜0(ΩX) = I, between the connected components of Kσ(ω0) and ω0 where σ is a loop representing the cell. For any oriented 1-cell e of X

consider the corresponding oriented one-cells e×x0 and x0 ×e of X ×X. As follows from formula (16) the crossed homomorphism f ′ : G×G → I

corresponding to θ is given by

f ′(g, 1) = g − 1, f ′(1, h) = h−1 − 1, h ∈ G.

Hence, we see that f ′(g, h) = f ′((g, 1)(1, h)) = f ′(g, 1)+(g, 1)f ′(1, h) = gh−1−1 = f (g, h).

Therefore θ = v.

Corollary 8. Let X be a cell complex with TC(X) = 2 dim(X) + 1. Then the topological complexity of the Eilenberg - MacLane complex Y = K(π1(X), 1) satisﬁes
TC(Y ) ≥ 2 dim(X) + 1.

TOPOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY

Proof. X is aspherical if dim X = 1. Hence we may assume that n =
dim(X) ≥ 2 and so Theorem 7 is applicable. Consider local systems IX on X × X and IY on Y × Y and cohomology classes vX ∈ H1(X × X; IX) and vY ∈ H1(Y × Y ; IY ) as described above. The canonical map f : X → Y inducing an isomorphism of fundamental groups satisﬁes (f × f )∗(IY ) = IX and (f × f )∗(vY ) = vX. If (vX )2n = 0 then (vY )2n = 0. Inequality TC(Y ) ≥ 2n + 1 now follows from [9], Corollary 4.40 since vY is a zero-divisor.

3. Proof of Theorem 1

Let X be a connected cell complex with π1(X) = Z2 = G. Clearly, n = dim(X) ≥ 2 and we may apply Theorem 7. The augmentation ideal I = ker[ǫ : Z[G] → Z] is isomorphic to Z as an abelian group; however I is nontrivial as a local system on X × X. More precisely, each of the classes (g, 1), (1, g) ∈ G × G (where g ∈ G is the unique nontrivial element) acts as multiplication by −1 on Z = I. It follows that the tensor square I ⊗Z I is the trivial coeﬃcient system Z.
Consider the canonical class v = vX ∈ H1(X × X; I) and its square
v2 ∈ H2(X × X; Z).

Since H1(X; Z) = 0 the Ku¨nneth theorem gives

H2(X × X) = H2(X) ⊗ H0(X) ⊕ H0(X) ⊗ H2(X)

where we dropped the coeﬃcient group Z from the notation. Hence we may write
v2 = a × 1 + 1 × b, a, b ∈ H2(X; Z).
By Lemma 4 one has a + b = 0, and by Corollary 6 both classes a and b are of order two: 2a = 0 = 2b. Hence we may write
v2 = a × 1 + 1 × a

and

n
v2n = (v2)n = (a × 1 + 1 × a)n =

n i

ai × an−i.

i=0

If n is odd then in the last sum either ai = 0 or an−i = 0 for dimensional

reasons. If n is even then

v2n =

n n/2

an/2 × an/2 = 0

since the binomial coeﬃcient

n n/2

is always even and 2a = 0. Theorem

7 implies now that TC(X) ≤ 2n.

To prove the second statement of the Theorem, assume that X is

a closed manifold satisfying π1(X) = Z2 and wn = 0 where w ∈

10

ARMINDO COSTA AND MICHAEL FARBER

H1(X; Z2) is the generator. By a Theorem of Berstein [1] mentioned earlier one has cat(X) ≤ dim(X). Our statement (5) follows now from
the inequality TC(X) ≤ 2cat(X) − 1, see [4]. This completes the proof.

4. Proof of Theorem 2

Let X be a cell complex such that the fundamental group π1(X, x0) = G = {1, t, t2} is cyclic of order 3, i.e. t3 = 1. The group ring Z[G] is the ring of polynomials of the form a + bt + ct2 with the usual addition and multiplication and with the additional identity t3 = 1; here the
coeﬃcients a, b, c ∈ Z are integers. The augmentation ideal I has rank 2; it is generated over Z by two elements α = t − 1 and β = t2 − t. The
structure of I as a Z[G × G]-module is given by

(t, 1) · α = β, (t, 1) · β = −α − β,

and (1, t) · α = −α − β, (1, t) · β = α.
Consider the canonical class vX ∈ H1(X × X; I) and its square v2X ∈ H2(X × X; I ⊗ I). The local system I ⊗ I has rank 4 and is generated by the elements α ⊗ α, α ⊗ β, β ⊗ α and β ⊗ β. The Z[G × G]-action is diagonal, for example

(t, 1) · α ⊗ α = β ⊗ β,

(t, 1) · α ⊗ β = β ⊗ (−α − β) = −β ⊗ α − β ⊗ β and so on. Consider the homomorphism

T :I⊗I →I⊗I

which interchanges the factors. One has T (α ⊗ β) = β ⊗ α, T (β ⊗ α) = α ⊗ β and T acts identically on two other generators α ⊗ α and β ⊗ β. It is easy to see that T is a Z[G × G]-homomorphism and hence can be viewed as a homomorphism of local systems.
Let I ∧ I ⊂ I ⊗ I denote the subgroup generated by the element α ⊗ β − β ⊗ α. One observes that I ∧ I = Z has a trivial Z[G × G]action; in particular it is a Z[G × G]-submodule of I ⊗ I. Denote the factor module by S(I); it is the symmetric square of I. We have the following exact sequence of local systems
0 → I ∧ I →i I ⊗ I →j S(I) → 0

(recall that I ∧ I = Z is trivial) which induces an exact sequence

→ Hn(X × X; I ∧ I) →i∗ Hn(X × X; I ⊗ I) →j∗ Hn(X × X; S(I)) →

We claim that the class v2X ∈ H2(X × X; I ⊗ I) satisﬁes

(17)

j∗(v2X ) = 0 ∈ H2(X × X; S(I)).

TOPOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY

11

From the skew-commutativity property of cup-products it follows that T∗(v2X ) = −v2X . Since j = j ◦ T we obtain
j∗(v2X ) = j∗T∗(v2X ) = −j∗(v2X ), i.e. 2j∗(v2X ) = 0.
On the other hand, by Corollary 6 one has 3j∗(v2X) = 0 which together with above implies that j∗(v2X ) = 0.
From the long exact cohomological sequence sequence we obtain that

(18)

v2X = i∗(w) for some w ∈ H2(X × X; Z).

We claim that any class w ∈ H2(X ×X; Z) satisfying (18) is annihilated

by multiplication by 6, i.e.

(19)

6w = 0.

Indeed, consider the map A : I ⊗ I → I ∧ I = Z given by A(x) =
x − T (x) for x ∈ I ⊗ I. Clearly A is a homomorphism of local systems
and A ◦ i : I ∧ I → I ∧ I is multiplication by 2. Hence we obtain 2w = A∗ ◦ i∗(w) = A∗(v2X ) which implies (19) since 3vX = 0.
By the Ku¨nneth theorem using H1(X; Z) = 0 one can write

w = a×1+1×b

where a, b ∈ H2(X; Z) with 6a = 0 = 6b. Then

n
v2Xn = (v2X )n = i∗(wn) =

n k

i∗(ak × bn−k).

k=0

If n is odd each term in the last sum vanishes for dimensional reasons. Suppose now that n is even, n = 2m. Then we obtain

v2Xn =

2m m

am × bm.

We have already mentioned that the binomial coeﬃcient

2m m

is always

even. It is divisible by 3 if the 3-adic expansion of m contains at

least one digit 2, see [8], Lemma 19. This shows that v2Xn = 0 under the conditions indicated in statement (i) of Theorem 2 and implies

statement (i) by applying Theorem 7.

Next we prove statement (ii) of Theorem 7. Let n ≥ 1 be such that

its 3-adic expansion contains only digits 0 and 1. Then the binomial

coeﬃcient

2n n

is not divisible by 3, see [8], Lemma 19.

Consider the lens space L23n+1 = S2n+1/Z3 where S2n+1 ⊂ Cn+1

is the unit sphere and Z3 = {1, ω, ω2} acts as the group of roots of

1, where ω = exp 2πi/3. It is well known that the lens space has

a cell decomposition with a unique cell in every dimension i for i =

0, 1, . . . , 2n+1, see [11], page 144-145. We will denote by X the skeleton

of L23n+1 of dimension 2n. Note that X has homotopy type of the lens

space L23n+1 with one point removed. We show below that TC(X) = 4n + 1 using the technique developed in [8].
The cohomology algebra H∗(X; Z3) can be described as the quotient of the polynomial algebra Z3[x, y] with two generators x of degree 1 and y of degree 2 subject to relations x2 = 0, yn+1 = 0 and xyn = 0, see [11], page 251. Here x ∈ H1(X; Z3) is the generator and
y = β(x) ∈ H2(X; Z3)
is the image of x under the Bockstein homomorphism β : H1(X; Z3) → H2(X; Z3) corresponding to the exact sequence
0 → Z3 → Z9 → Z3 → 0.
The classes yk, where k = 0, 1, . . . , n, together with xyj for all j = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1 form an additive basis of H∗(X; Z3). By the Ku¨nneth theorem one has
H∗(X × X; Z3) = H∗(X; Z3) ⊗ H∗(X; Z3)
and therefore the classes
xayb × xcyd ∈ H∗(X × X; Z3)
where a, c ∈ {0, 1} and b, d ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n} and (a, b) = (1, n), (c, d) = (1, n) form an additive basis. We denote by x¯ and y¯ the classes
x¯ = x×1−1×x ∈ H1(X ×X; Z3), y¯ = y ×1−1×y ∈ H2(X ×X; Z3).
It is shown in [8] that β(x¯) = y¯ and therefore the class y¯ has weight two with respect to ﬁbration (1).
Recall that a cohomology class u ∈ H∗(X × X; R) is said to have weight greater than or equal to k (notation wgt(u) ≥ k) if the restriction u|A = 0 vanishes for any open subset A ⊂ X × X with TCX(A) ≤ k, see [8] and [9], §4.5. Here TCX(A) denotes the relative topological complexity of a subset A ⊂ X × X; the latter is deﬁned as the smallest number r such that A admits an open cover A = U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ur with the property that the projections X ← Ui → X on the ﬁrst and the second factors are homotopic to each other, for all i = 1, . . . , r.
By Lemma 4.39 of [9] one has
wgt((y¯)2n) ≥ 2n · wgt(y¯) ≥ 4n
and the nontriviality of the power (y¯)2n ∈ H4n(X ×X; Z3) would imply TC(X) ≥ 4n + 1, according to Proposition 4.36 of [9]. The opposite inequality TC(X) ≤ 4n + 1 follows directly from (2) giving TC(X) = 4n + 1 as desired.

TOPOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY

13

By a direct computation one has

(y¯)2n = (−1)n

2n n

yn × yn

and the binomial coeﬃcient

2n n

is mutually prime to 3 due to the fact

that the 3-adic expansion of n involves only small digits ni ∈ {0, 1},

see Appendix B from [8]. Thus we obtain (y¯)2n = 0 completing the

proof.
