    Abstract: Let X be a subcomplex of the standard CW-decomposition of the n-dimensional torus. We exhibit an explicit optimal motion planning algorithm for X. This construction is used to calculate the topological complexity of complements of general position arrangements and Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces associated to right-angled Artin groups. 

Comments: 	Results extended to arbitrary subcomplexes of tori. Results on products of even spheres added
