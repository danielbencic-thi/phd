SECTION I.
Introduction

Unmanned vehicles have been developed rapidly. The UAVs got many advanced advantages such as high concealment and mobility [1] , [2] . Complex missions such as environmental exploration [3] , surveillance [4] and target tracking [5] can be performed with the help of UAVs to provide vision safely [6] .

Many efforts are proposed to track moving target using multi-UAVs [7] , [8] . In order to coordinate multi-UAVs, communication capabilities such as sensing ability or topological interactions [9] , [10] need be promised. Besides, the information fusion method is utilized to process the information and communication noise [11] , [12] .

UAVs can also cooperate with ground unit [13] . By using a probabilistic path planning method, UAVs and ground vehicle are utilized to track target in urban environment [14] , [15] . In environmental exploration, UAVs need track ground unit and provide vision in the desired formation, while many efforts are proposed to solve this problem using multi-UAVs [16] â€“ [17] [18] .

The obstacle avoidance method must be utilized for UAVs when exploring the complex environment. The obstacles avoidance method is combined with the formation control scheme [19] , [20] . The model predictive formation control is utilized to guide UAVs avoid collision [22] . The current obstacles avoidance method can be divided into several types: heuristic search based method, optimization algorithm [21] , potential field and stream function based method. To promise the computational efficiency and quality of trajectory in 3D complex environment, an IFDS based method is utilized to guide UAV avoid obstacles smoothly [23] , [24] . The IFDS method will not change the stability and general direction of original system, so it is suitable to combined with formation scheme of multi-UAVs.

Multi-UAVs and ground vehicle are utilized to explore a complex environment with obstacles. The UAVs are responsible to provide wider vision for ground vehicle. The detection sensor is mounted on UAV, however the coverage area of sensor is limited. Then multi-UAVs can form the desired formation around ground vehicle cooperatively to maximizes the total vision area of UAV formation.

The desired formation requires UAVs to be evenly distributed around ground vehicle. The flying height and radial distance from vehicle to UAV are designed under constraints to maximizes the total vision area. The main goal is to let multi-UAVs track the ground vehicle in desired formation and avoid obstacles at same time. Overall, the main contributions can be divided into several parts as follow:

    The desired UAV formation is proposed to maximizes the total vision area in simple environment. The desired flying height and radial distance are optimized under constraints.

    The formation control scheme of multi-UAVs is combined with IFDS method when exploring the complex environment. It is updated according to original desired formation and risk of collision.

    The simulation is finished with three UAVs and ground vehicle. The results showed that multi-UAVs can maintain the desired formation around ground vehicle and avoid obstacles at same time in complex environment.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the mathematical model of UAVs and ground vehicle. Section 3 gives the desired UAV formation and updated control scheme of multi-UAVs in complex environment. In section 4 , the simulation verify the effectiveness of proposed method to guide UAVs avoid collision and maintain the desired formation in complex environment. Lastly, conclusion is given in section 5 .
SECTION II.
Mathematical Formulation

Mathematical model of UAVs and detection sensor are described in this section. The model of ground vehicle is also described, respectively.
A. Model of UAV

Several homogeneous quadcopters are utilized in this mission, shown in Fig. 1 . The mathematical model of quadcopter is given as, \begin{align*} &\begin{bmatrix}\dot{x}_{i}\\ \dot{y}_{i}\\ \dot{z}_{i} \end{bmatrix}=\left[\begin{matrix}\cos \psi_{i}\cos \theta_{i}-\sin \psi_{i}\cos \phi_{i}+\cos \psi_{i}\sin \theta_{i}\sin \phi_{i}\\ \sin \psi_{i}\cos \theta_{i}\ \ \cos \psi_{i}\cos \phi_{i}+\sin \psi_{i}\sin \theta_{i}\sin \phi_{i}\\ -\sin \theta_{i}\qquad\qquad\qquad\cos \theta_{i}\sin \phi_{i}\qquad\quad\end{matrix}\right.\\ &\left.\begin{matrix}\ldots & \sin \psi_{i}\sin \phi_{i}+\cos \psi_{i}\sin \theta_{i}\cos \phi_{i}\\ \ldots & -\cos \psi_{i}\sin \phi_{i}+\sin \psi_{i}\sin \theta_{i}\cos \phi_{i}\\ \ldots & \cos \theta_{i}\cos \phi_{i}\end{matrix}\right]\ \begin{bmatrix} w_{x, i}\\ w_{y, i}\\ w_{z, i} \end{bmatrix}\tag{1} \end{align*}
View Source \begin{align*} &\begin{bmatrix}\dot{x}_{i}\\ \dot{y}_{i}\\ \dot{z}_{i} \end{bmatrix}=\left[\begin{matrix}\cos \psi_{i}\cos \theta_{i}-\sin \psi_{i}\cos \phi_{i}+\cos \psi_{i}\sin \theta_{i}\sin \phi_{i}\\ \sin \psi_{i}\cos \theta_{i}\ \ \cos \psi_{i}\cos \phi_{i}+\sin \psi_{i}\sin \theta_{i}\sin \phi_{i}\\ -\sin \theta_{i}\qquad\qquad\qquad\cos \theta_{i}\sin \phi_{i}\qquad\quad\end{matrix}\right.\\ &\left.\begin{matrix}\ldots & \sin \psi_{i}\sin \phi_{i}+\cos \psi_{i}\sin \theta_{i}\cos \phi_{i}\\ \ldots & -\cos \psi_{i}\sin \phi_{i}+\sin \psi_{i}\sin \theta_{i}\cos \phi_{i}\\ \ldots & \cos \theta_{i}\cos \phi_{i}\end{matrix}\right]\ \begin{bmatrix} w_{x, i}\\ w_{y, i}\\ w_{z, i} \end{bmatrix}\tag{1} \end{align*} where P_{i}=(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i}) is position of i\text{th} quadcopter based on ground system, (i=1,\ldots, n). w_{i} is velocity vector based on vehicle coordinate system, and \phi_{i}, \theta_{i}, \psi_{i} are roll, pitch and yaw angle of i\text{th} quadcopter. The flight control system of UAVs are assumed to be stable, then the desired velocity, altitude of UAV can be well tracked.

B. Model of Detection Sensor

The detection sensor with adjustable observation angle is mounted on UAV to provide vision. The coverage area of sensor represent the field of view (FOV) of UAV, shown in Fig. 2 . The radius r of the FOV is given as, \begin{equation*} r=h\tan\gamma \tag{2} \end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*} r=h\tan\gamma \tag{2} \end{equation*} where h is flying height of UAV and \gamma is the maximum sensor field angle. Then the area is expressed as, \begin{equation*} S_{FOV}=\{(x_{s}, y_{s})\in R^{2}\vert (x_{s}- x_{os})^{2}+(y_{s}- y_{os})^{2}\leq r^{2}\} \tag{3} \end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*} S_{FOV}=\{(x_{s}, y_{s})\in R^{2}\vert (x_{s}- x_{os})^{2}+(y_{s}- y_{os})^{2}\leq r^{2}\} \tag{3} \end{equation*}

Location ( x_{s}, y_{s} ) is inside the area S_{FOV} . The center ( x_{os}, y_{os} ) coincide with the location ( x_{i}, y_{i} ).

C. Model of Ground Vehicle

The state vector X_{G}(k) and mathematical model of ground vehicle are given as, \begin{align*} &X_{G}(k)=(x_{G}(k), x_{G}{}^{\prime}(k), x_{G}{}^{\prime\prime}(k), y_{G}(k), y_{G}{}^{\prime}(k), y_{G}{}^{\prime\prime}(k))^{T}\\ &X_{G}(k+1)= GX_{G}(k)+q(k) \tag{4} \end{align*}
View Source \begin{align*} &X_{G}(k)=(x_{G}(k), x_{G}{}^{\prime}(k), x_{G}{}^{\prime\prime}(k), y_{G}(k), y_{G}{}^{\prime}(k), y_{G}{}^{\prime\prime}(k))^{T}\\ &X_{G}(k+1)= GX_{G}(k)+q(k) \tag{4} \end{align*} where q(k) is a Gauusian process noise which satisfy p(q)\sim N(0, \eta) , and \eta is covariance matrix. G is transition matrix.

SECTION III.
Formation Control of Multi-UAVs and Obstacles Avoidance

The desired UAV formation around ground vehicle is proposed to maximizes the total vision area, where the desired flying height and radial distance are designed under constraints.

In simple environment, the formation control scheme is proposed to let multi-UAVs form the desired UAV formation, while the scheme is updated in complex environment to combine with IFDS method.

A. Optimal Formation in Simple Environment

In the air-ground cooperative exploration, the ground vehicle is responsible for the communication. Then the desired UAV formation must be obtained under the distance constraints between UAV and vehicle for stable communication.

The flying height h_{i} of i \text{th} UAV and radial distance d_{xy, i} between UAV and ground vehicle ( x_{G}, y_{G} ) on xy plane are shown in Fig. 3 . The d_{xy, i} is given as, \begin{equation*} d_{xy, i}=((x_{G}-x_{i})^{2}+(y_{G}-y_{i})^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}} \tag{5} \end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*} d_{xy, i}=((x_{G}-x_{i})^{2}+(y_{G}-y_{i})^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}} \tag{5} \end{equation*}

The distance d_{i} between i\text{th} UAV and ground vehicle P_{G} is constrained for stable communication. The d_{i} is given as, \begin{equation*}\begin{split} d_{i}&=(d_{xy, i}^{2}+ h_{i}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}\\ d_{i}&\leq d_{\max}/\lambda \end{split}\tag{6}\end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*}\begin{split} d_{i}&=(d_{xy, i}^{2}+ h_{i}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}\\ d_{i}&\leq d_{\max}/\lambda \end{split}\tag{6}\end{equation*} where d_{\max} is the distance constraint. The dilatation coefficient \lambda greater than 1 is introduced here.

To maximizes the total vision areas S_{total} , UAVs need be distributed evenly around vehicle with same desired d_{xy, o} and height h_{o} . The S_{total} increase with the increasing of both d_{xy, o} and h_{o} , however they are both constrained by d_{\max} according to Eq. (6) . Then the rate coefficient \alpha=h/d_{xy} is regarded as the optimization parameter in maximization of S_{total} .

For example, three UAVs at ( P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3} ) are distributed evenly around vehicle P_{G} with different \alpha and same distance d , shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) . S_{total} is obtained by overlapping S_{FOV} of each UAV, while ( P_{a}, P_{b}, P_{c} ) are the intersection points of S_{FOV} . Then S_{total} can be divided into equal three S without overlapping. For example, the area S for UAV at P_{2} consists of triangular area S_{\Delta P_{G}P_{2}P_{b}}, S_{\Delta P_{G}P_{2}P_{a}} and sector area S_{P_{b}P_{2}P_{a}} with angle \mu. S_{total} is given as, \begin{align*} &S_{total}=3S\\ &S=2S_{1}+ S_{2}\\ &S_{1}=\frac{1}{2}(\cos\frac{\pi}{3}d_{xy}+(r^{2}-(sin\frac{\pi}{3}d_{xy})^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}})\sin\frac{\pi}{3} d_{xy} \tag{7}\\ &S_{2}= \frac{1}{2}r^{2}\mu\\ &\mu=2\pi-2(\frac{\pi}{6}+\cos^{-1}\frac{sin\frac{\pi}{3}d_{xy}}{r}) \end{align*}
View Source \begin{align*} &S_{total}=3S\\ &S=2S_{1}+ S_{2}\\ &S_{1}=\frac{1}{2}(\cos\frac{\pi}{3}d_{xy}+(r^{2}-(sin\frac{\pi}{3}d_{xy})^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}})\sin\frac{\pi}{3} d_{xy} \tag{7}\\ &S_{2}= \frac{1}{2}r^{2}\mu\\ &\mu=2\pi-2(\frac{\pi}{6}+\cos^{-1}\frac{sin\frac{\pi}{3}d_{xy}}{r}) \end{align*} where S consists of 2 S_{1} and S_{2} . The S_{1} is the triangular area S_{\Delta P_{G}P_{2}P_{b}} or S_{\Delta P_{G}P_{2}P_{a}} and S_{2} is the sector area S_{P_{b}P_{2}P_{a}} . Besides, the length of green line is d_{xy} , blue line is radius r .

Then the area S is expressed by distance d and rate coefficient \alpha according to Eq. (7) , given as, \begin{align*} &S=(\frac{1}{2}+(\alpha^{2}-\frac{3}{4})^{\frac{1}{2}})\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} d_{xy}^{2}+ d_{xy}^{2}\alpha^{2}(\frac{5\pi}{6}-\cos^{-1}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2\alpha})\\ &= \frac{d^{2}}{1+\alpha^{2}}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}+\frac{\sqrt{3(\alpha^{2}-\frac{3}{4})}}{2}+\alpha^{2}(\frac{5\pi}{6}-\cos^{-1}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2\alpha})) \tag{8} \end{align*}
View Source \begin{align*} &S=(\frac{1}{2}+(\alpha^{2}-\frac{3}{4})^{\frac{1}{2}})\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} d_{xy}^{2}+ d_{xy}^{2}\alpha^{2}(\frac{5\pi}{6}-\cos^{-1}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2\alpha})\\ &= \frac{d^{2}}{1+\alpha^{2}}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}+\frac{\sqrt{3(\alpha^{2}-\frac{3}{4})}}{2}+\alpha^{2}(\frac{5\pi}{6}-\cos^{-1}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2\alpha})) \tag{8} \end{align*} where \gamma is assumed to be 45^{\circ} for computation, then r=h=\alpha d_{xy}. h and d_{xy} can both be expressed by rate \alpha and d . The maximization of S/d^{2} is only related to coefficient \alpha , shown in Fig. 5 .

The relative area S/d^{2} changes with coefficient \alpha , and obviously there is a maximum value of S/d^{2} . The optimal \alpha_{o} can be obtained by deriving the equation or finding the abscissa of maximum point as, \begin{equation*} \alpha_{o}= \arg\max (S/d^{2}) \tag{9} \end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*} \alpha_{o}= \arg\max (S/d^{2}) \tag{9} \end{equation*}

The desired UAV formation around ground vehicle is obtained according to \alpha_{o} and d_{\max}/\lambda as, \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &d_{xy, o}= \frac{(d_{\max}/\lambda)}{(1+ \alpha_{o}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}}\\ &h_{o}= \alpha_{o}\frac{(d_{\max}/\lambda)}{(1+ \alpha_{o}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}} \end{split}\tag{10}\end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &d_{xy, o}= \frac{(d_{\max}/\lambda)}{(1+ \alpha_{o}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}}\\ &h_{o}= \alpha_{o}\frac{(d_{\max}/\lambda)}{(1+ \alpha_{o}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}} \end{split}\tag{10}\end{equation*} where h_{o} and d_{xy, o} are desired parameters of UAV formation. The formation control scheme of multi-UAVs is proposed to maintain this formation in simple environment.

B. Formation Update Scheme in Complex Environment

The formation control scheme of multi-DAVs is proposed to maintain the original desired formation, while obstacles avoidance method must be utilized and combined with formation scheme in exploration of complex environment. To maintain the original desired formation, the formation scheme is updated according to the need of obstacles avoidance.

To describe the risk of collision in the complex environment, the obstacles or threats are expressed as, \begin{align*} &\Gamma_{l}(P)=(\frac{x- x_{o, l}}{\rho_{x, l}})^{2 p_{x, l}}+(\frac{y- y_{o, l}}{\rho_{y, l}})^{2 p_{y, l}}+(\frac{z- z_{o, l}}{\rho_{z, l}})^{2 p_{z, l}}\\ &\Gamma_{\min}(P)= min(\Gamma_{l}(P)),(l=1,2,\ldots, L) \tag{11} \end{align*}
View Source \begin{align*} &\Gamma_{l}(P)=(\frac{x- x_{o, l}}{\rho_{x, l}})^{2 p_{x, l}}+(\frac{y- y_{o, l}}{\rho_{y, l}})^{2 p_{y, l}}+(\frac{z- z_{o, l}}{\rho_{z, l}})^{2 p_{z, l}}\\ &\Gamma_{\min}(P)= min(\Gamma_{l}(P)),(l=1,2,\ldots, L) \tag{11} \end{align*} where \Gamma_{l}(P) is the surface function of l\text{th} obstacle in the environment, (l=1,2, \ldots, L).\ P=(x, y, z) is the position in the environment. ( x_{o, l}, y_{o, l}, z_{o, l} ) are center of l\text{th} obstacle in three dimensions. Parameter \rho_{l} and p_{l} are utilized to describe the size and shape of l\text{th} obstacles.

The \Gamma_{l}(P) represent the relationship between position P and surface of l\text{th} obstacle, then it can describe the risk of collision when UAV at P approaching to l\text{th} obstacles. The \Gamma_{\min}(P) represents how close the closet obstacle to UAV at P , then it can describe the need of obstacles avoidance method for UAV at P .

To combine with IFDS method, the formation control scheme is updated according to original desired h_{o},\ d_{xy, o} and \Gamma_{\min}(P) . Then the Eq. (10) is updated as, \begin{align*} &z_{d, i}=(h_{o}- z_{i})(1- b_{z}e^{- \Gamma_{\min}(P_{i})/ c_{z}})^{a_{z}}+ z_{i}\\ &d_{xy, o}=((d_{\max}/\lambda)^{2}- z_{i}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}(1- b_{d}e^{- \Gamma_{\min}(P_{i})/ c_{d}})^{a_{d}} \tag{12} \end{align*}
View Source \begin{align*} &z_{d, i}=(h_{o}- z_{i})(1- b_{z}e^{- \Gamma_{\min}(P_{i})/ c_{z}})^{a_{z}}+ z_{i}\\ &d_{xy, o}=((d_{\max}/\lambda)^{2}- z_{i}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}(1- b_{d}e^{- \Gamma_{\min}(P_{i})/ c_{d}})^{a_{d}} \tag{12} \end{align*} where z_{d, i} is the updated desired flying height of i \text{th} UAV when UAV at P_{i} approaching to obstacle. The desired radial distance d_{xy, o} of i \text{th} UAV is updated according to z_{i} and d_{\max}/\lambda. d_{xy, o} decreased if z_{i} was raised by IFDS method to avoid obstacles, thereby d_{i} can be still constrained by d_{\max}/\lambda .

Then desired location ( x_{d, i}, y_{d, i} ) of i \text{th} UAV on xy plane are given as, \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &\begin{bmatrix} x_{d, i}\\ y_{d, i}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} x_{G}\\ y_{G}\end{bmatrix}- d_{xy, o} \frac{e_{i+1}+ e_{i+1}}{\Vert e_{i+1}+ e_{i-1}\Vert}\\ &e_{i}=\frac{P_{xy, i}- P_{G}}{\Vert P_{xy, i}- P_{G}\Vert}[\frac{x_{i}- x_{G}}{d_{xy, i}},\frac{y_{i}- y_{G}}{d_{xy, i}}]^{T} \end{split}\tag{13}\end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &\begin{bmatrix} x_{d, i}\\ y_{d, i}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} x_{G}\\ y_{G}\end{bmatrix}- d_{xy, o} \frac{e_{i+1}+ e_{i+1}}{\Vert e_{i+1}+ e_{i-1}\Vert}\\ &e_{i}=\frac{P_{xy, i}- P_{G}}{\Vert P_{xy, i}- P_{G}\Vert}[\frac{x_{i}- x_{G}}{d_{xy, i}},\frac{y_{i}- y_{G}}{d_{xy, i}}]^{T} \end{split}\tag{13}\end{equation*} where P_{xy, i} are location of i\text{th} UAV on xy plane. (e_{i+1}, e_{i-1}) represents the relative locations of other two neighbor UAVs for calculating the desired location of i\text{th} UAV. It's no need to distinguish the other two neighbor UAVs.

C. Combination of Obstacles Avoidance Method

The IFDS method is utilized to guide UAVs avoid collision. Compared with traditional method, the biggest advantage of IFDS method is its high computation efficiency.

The original velocity vector of UAVs are considered as initial streamlines, while the influence of static obstacles in environment to the initial streamlines are expressed as a modulation matrix, shown in Fig. 6 . Then original velocity vector are modified by the modulation matrix and regarded as the desired velocity of UAVs. The original general direction of UAV will not be changed by IFDS method.
Fig. 6.

The desired position of each UAV P_{d, i}=[x_{d, i}, y_{d, i}, z_{d, i}]^{T} is obtained according to Eq. (12) and Eq. (13) , then desired velocity vector V_{d, i} of i\text{th} UAV is obtained according to position error, given as, \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &V_{d, i}= f_{v}(\Vert P_{d, i}- P_{i}\Vert) \frac{P_{d, i}- P_{i}}{\Vert P_{d, i}- P_{i}\Vert}\\ &f_{v}(\xi)=(1- b_{v}e^{-\xi/ c_{v}})^{a_{v}} V_{\max} \end{split}\tag{14}\end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &V_{d, i}= f_{v}(\Vert P_{d, i}- P_{i}\Vert) \frac{P_{d, i}- P_{i}}{\Vert P_{d, i}- P_{i}\Vert}\\ &f_{v}(\xi)=(1- b_{v}e^{-\xi/ c_{v}})^{a_{v}} V_{\max} \end{split}\tag{14}\end{equation*}

Modulation matrix which represents the influence of l\text{th} obstacle to velocity vector V_{d, i} of UAV at P=(x, y, z) is given as, \begin{align*} &\omega_{l}(P)=\prod\limits_{i=1,i\neq l}^{L}\frac{\Gamma_{i}(P)-1}{(\Gamma_{i}(P)-1)+(\Gamma_{l}(P)-1)}\\ &n_{l}(P)=[\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial x},\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial y},\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial z}]^{T}\\ &\mathrm{t}_{l}(P)=[\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial y},-\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial x}, 0]^{T}\\ &M_{l}(P)=I-\frac{\omega_{l}(P)n_{l}(P)n_{l}(P)^{T}}{\vert \Gamma_{l}(P)\vert^{\frac{1}{\delta_{l}}} n_{l}(P)^{T} n_{l}(P)}+ \frac{\omega_{l}(P)t_{l}(P) n_{l}(P)^{T}}{\vert \Gamma_{l}(P)\vert^{\frac{1}{\sigma_{l}}}\Vert t_{l}(P)\Vert\Vert n_{l}(P)\Vert}\tag{15} \end{align*}
View Source \begin{align*} &\omega_{l}(P)=\prod\limits_{i=1,i\neq l}^{L}\frac{\Gamma_{i}(P)-1}{(\Gamma_{i}(P)-1)+(\Gamma_{l}(P)-1)}\\ &n_{l}(P)=[\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial x},\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial y},\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial z}]^{T}\\ &\mathrm{t}_{l}(P)=[\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial y},-\frac{\partial \Gamma_{l}(P)}{\partial x}, 0]^{T}\\ &M_{l}(P)=I-\frac{\omega_{l}(P)n_{l}(P)n_{l}(P)^{T}}{\vert \Gamma_{l}(P)\vert^{\frac{1}{\delta_{l}}} n_{l}(P)^{T} n_{l}(P)}+ \frac{\omega_{l}(P)t_{l}(P) n_{l}(P)^{T}}{\vert \Gamma_{l}(P)\vert^{\frac{1}{\sigma_{l}}}\Vert t_{l}(P)\Vert\Vert n_{l}(P)\Vert}\tag{15} \end{align*} where M_{l}(P) and \omega_{l}(P) are modulation matrix and weight coefficient of l\text{th} obstacle. n_{l}(P) and t_{l}(P) are normal vector and tangent vector. \delta_{l} and \sigma_{l} are repulsive and tangential parameter which represent degree of influence. The bigger those two parameters, the earlier UAV will be guided to avoid obstacle. Besides, \delta mainly focus on z direction component to raise flying height of UAV, so it is mainly considered.

Velocity vector V_{d, i} is considered as original streamlines of IFDS method. Total modulation matrix \bar{M}(P) represents influence of all obstacles on V_{d, i}.\ \bar{M}(P) and \bar{V}_{d, i}(P) are given as, \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &\bar{M}(P)= \prod\limits_{i=l}^{n} M_{l}(P)\\ &\bar{V}_{d, i}(P)=\frac{\bar{M}(P) V_{d, i}(P)}{\Vert \bar{M}(P) V_{d, i}(P)\Vert}\Vert V_{d, i}(P)\Vert \end{split}\tag{16}\end{equation*}
View Source \begin{equation*}\begin{split} &\bar{M}(P)= \prod\limits_{i=l}^{n} M_{l}(P)\\ &\bar{V}_{d, i}(P)=\frac{\bar{M}(P) V_{d, i}(P)}{\Vert \bar{M}(P) V_{d, i}(P)\Vert}\Vert V_{d, i}(P)\Vert \end{split}\tag{16}\end{equation*} where \bar{V}_{d, i}(P) is regarded as modified velocity vector of i\text{th} UAV at P . To ensure \bar{V}_{d, i}(P) can still maintain the general direction, \bar{V}_{d, i}(P) will not be in opposite direction of V_{d, i}(P) , which is \bar{V}_{d, i}(P)\cdot V_{d, i}(P) > 0 . Besides, \Vert \bar{V}_{d, i}(P)\Vert =\Vert V_{d, i}(P)\vert ensure length of velocity vector be less than maximum velocity V_{\max} .

The trajectory of ground vehicle is given as, \begin{equation*}\begin{split} \mathrm{x}_{G}(\mathrm{t}) &=100+2\mathrm{t}+100\sin(0.001\mathrm{t})\\ \mathrm{y}_{G}(\mathrm{t}) &=-200+400\sin(0.01\mathrm{t})+400\cos(0.001\mathrm{t}) \end{split}\tag{17}\end{equation*}

The obstacles is assumed to be passable for ground vehicle. The maximum distance between each UAV and ground vehicle are d_{\max}=200m and d_{\max}/\lambda=190m . Multi-UAVs take off at initial positions (150,180,0)m, (100,150,0)m and (50,180,0)m.

The desired h_{o} and d_{xy, o} are obtained according to Eq. (10) . \gamma=45^{\circ} . Then optimal rate coefficient is given as \alpha_{o}\approx 1.61. h_{o}\approx 161m and d_{xv, o}\approx 100m .

The coefficient ( a_{z}, b_{z}, c_{z} ) change the desired flying height z_{d, i} in Eq. (12) , which are set to (30,0.1,10). The coefficient ( a_{d}, b_{d}, c_{d} ) are set to (4,0.1,10). In Eq. (14) , the coefficient ( a_{v}, b_{v}, c_{v} ) are set to (40,0.1,10). The maximum speed is V_{\max}=10m/s. \delta and \sigma are set to (0.5,0.2). The maximum height of obstacles are 180m, UAV would collide with the obstacles if the IFDS method was not used.
B. Results of Simulation

In the first simulation, the IFDS method is not utilized. The trajectory of multi-UAVs and ground vehicle are shown in Fig. 7 . Obviously, UAVs collide with obstacles while the desired formation is maintained. The d_{i},\ d_{xy, i} and h_{i} of multi-UAVs are shown in Fig. 8 . Height h_{i} of multi-UAVs stay at 161m, and the d_{xy, i} are kept near 100m to maintain the UAV formation.

In the second simulation, the IFDS method is utilized and combined with updated formation control scheme. UAVs can avoid obstacles by raising the flying height h_{i} , while d_{i} of multi-UAVs are kept under constraint d_{\max}/\lambda , shown in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 10(b) , the d_{i} of second UAV exceeds the constraint d_{\max}/\lambda for a while, but it is no more than d_{max} .
SECTION V.
Conclusion

In this paper, the IFDS method will not change the stability of original system and general direction of UAV, which is suitable for maintaining the original formation. The formation control scheme is designed to eliminate the conflict in combination with IFDS method. More kinematic information of neighbor agents can be considered in the design of upper layer of formation control strategy. The controller of UAV can take sliding model control or other advanced algorithm to deal with a more complex system of quadcopter. Next, we can apply this air-ground structure to other applications such as target capturing. Another possible direction is to extend the application on the fixed wing UAV which got kinematic constraints.
