Abstract

This paper describes a collision avoidance algorithm for planning a safe path for a polyhedral object moving among known polyhedral objects. The algorithm transforms the obstacles so that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitrary reference point on the moving object. A trajectory of this reference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions. Trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates, for each vertex in the transformed obstacles, which other vertices can be reached safely.
