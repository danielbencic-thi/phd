Basic Point-Set Topology

Chapter 1. Basic Point-Set Topology
One way to describe the subject of Topology is to say that it is qualitative geometry. The idea is that if one geometric object can be continuously transformed into another, then the two objects are to be viewed as being topologically the same. For example, a circle and a square are topologically equivalent. Physically, a rubber band can be stretched into the form of either a circle or a square, as well as many other shapes which are also viewed as being topologically equivalent. On the other hand, a ﬁgure eight curve formed by two circles touching at a point is to be regarded as topologically distinct from a circle or square. A qualitative property that distinguishes the circle from the ﬁgure eight is the number of connected pieces that remain when a single point is removed: When a point is removed from a circle what remains is still connected, a single arc, whereas for a ﬁgure eight if one removes the point of contact of its two circles, what remains is two separate arcs, two separate pieces.
The term used to describe two geometric objects that are topologically equivalent is homeomorphic. Thus a circle and a square are homeomorphic. Concretely, if we place a circle C inside a square S with the same center point, then projecting the circle radially outward to the
square deﬁnes a function f : C→S , and this function is
continuous: small changes in x produce small changes in
f (x) . The function f has an inverse f −1 : S→C obtained
by projecting the square radially inward to the circle, and this is continuous as well. One says that f is a homeomorphism between C and S .
One of the basic problems of Topology is to determine when two given geometric objects are homeomorphic. This can be quite diﬃcult in general.
Our ﬁrst goal will be to deﬁne exactly what the ‘geometric objects’ are that one studies in Topology. These are called topological spaces. The deﬁnition turns out to be extremely general, so that many objects that are topological spaces are not very geometric at all, in fact.

Topological Spaces
Rather than jump directly into the deﬁnition of a topological space we will ﬁrst spend a little time motivating the deﬁnition by discussing the notion of continuity of a function. One could say that topological spaces are the objects for which continuous functions can be deﬁned.
For the sake of simplicity and concreteness let us talk about functions f : R→R .
There are two deﬁnitions of continuity for such a function that the reader may already be familiar with, the ε - δ deﬁnition and the deﬁnition in terms of limits. But it is a

2

Chapter 1

third deﬁnition, equivalent to these two, that is the one we want here. This deﬁnition is expressed in terms of the notion of an open set in R , generalizing the familiar idea of an open interval (a, b) .
Deﬁnition. A subset O of R is open if for each point x ∈ O there exists an interval (a, b) that contains x and is contained in O .
With this deﬁnition an open interval certainly qualiﬁes as an open set. Other examples are:
R itself is an open set, as are semi-inﬁnite intervals (a, ∞) and (−∞, a) . The complement of a ﬁnite set in R is open. If A is the union of the inﬁnite sequence xn = 1/n , n = 1, 2, ··· , together with its limit 0 then the complement R − A is open. Any union of open intervals is an open set. The preceding examples are special cases of this. The converse statement is also true: every open set O is a union of open intervals since for each x ∈ O there is an open interval (ax, bx) with x ∈ (ax, bx) ⊂ O , and O is the union of all these intervals (ax, bx) . The empty set ∅ is open, since the condition for openness is satisﬁed vacuously as there are no points x where the condition could fail to hold.
Here are some examples of sets which are not open: A closed interval [a, b] is not an open set since there is no open interval about either a or b that is contained in [a, b] . Similarly, half-open intervals [a, b) and (a, b] are not open sets when a < b . A nonempty ﬁnite set is not open.
Now for the nice deﬁnition of a continuous function in terms of open sets:
Deﬁnition. A function f : R→R is continuous if for each open set O in R the inverse
image f −1(O) = x ∈ R f (x) ∈ O is also an open set.
To see that this corresponds to the intuitive notion of continuity, consider what would happen if this condition failed to hold for a function f . There would then be an open set O for which f −1(O) was not open. This means there would be a point x0 ∈ f −1(O) for which there was no interval (a, b) containing x0 and contained in f −1(O) . This is equivalent to saying there would be points x arbitrarily close to x0 that are in the complement of f −1(O) . For x to be in the complement of f −1(O) means that f (x) is not in O . On the other hand, x0 was in f −1(O) so f (x0) is in O . Since O was assumed to be open, there is an interval (c, d) about f (x0) that is contained in O . The points f (x) that are not in O are therefore not in (c, d) so they remain at least a ﬁxed positive distance from f (x0) . To summarize: there are points x arbitrarily close to x0 for which f (x) remains at least a ﬁxed positive distance away from f (x0) . This certainly says that f is discontinuous at x0 .
This reasoning can be reversed. A reasonable interpretation of discontinuity of f at x0 would be that there are points x arbitrarily close to x0 for which f (x) stays

Basic Point-Set Topology

at least a ﬁxed positive distance away from f (x0) . Call this ﬁxed positive distance ε . Let O be the open set (f (x0) − ε, f (x0) + ε) . Then f −1(O) contains x0 but it does not contain any points x for which f (x) is not in O , and we are assuming there are such points x arbitrarily close to x0 , so f −1(O) is not open since it does not contain all points in some interval (a, b) about x0 .
The deﬁnition we have given for continuity of functions R→R can be applied more generally to functions Rn→Rn and even Rm→Rn once one has a notion of
what open sets in Rn are. The natural deﬁnition generalizing the case n = 1 is to say that a set O in Rn is open if for each x ∈ O there exists an open ball containing x and contained in O , where an open ball of radius r and center x0 is deﬁned to be the set of points x of distance less than r from x0 . Here the distance from x to x0 is measured as in linear algebra, as the length of the vector x − x0 , the square root of the dot product of this vector with itself.
This deﬁnition of open sets in Rn does not depend as heavily on the notion of distance in Rn as might appear. For example in R2 where open “balls" are open disks, we could use open squares instead of open disks since if a point x ∈ O is contained in an open disk contained in O then it is also contained in an open square contained in the disk and hence in O , and conversely, if x is contained in an open square contained in O then it is contained in an open disk contained in the open square and hence in O . In a similar way we could use many other shapes besides disks and squares, such as ellipses or polygons with any number of sides.
After these preliminary remarks we now give the deﬁnition of a topological space.
Deﬁnition. A topological space is a set X together with a collection O of subsets of
X , called open sets, such that:
(1) The union of any collection of sets in O is in O . (2) The intersection of any ﬁnite collection of sets in O is in O . (3) Both ∅ and X are in O .
The collection O of open sets is called a topology on X .
All three of these conditions hold for open sets in R as deﬁned earlier. To check that (1) holds, suppose that we have a collection of open sets Oα where the index α ranges over some index set I , either ﬁnite or inﬁnite. A point x ∈ α Oα lies in some Oα , which is open so there is an interval (a, b) with x ∈ (a, b) ⊂ Oα , hence x ∈ (a, b) ⊂ α Oα so α Oα is open. To check (2) it suﬃces by induction to check that the intersection of two open sets O1 and O2 is open. If x ∈ O1 ∩ O2 then x lies in open intervals in O1 and O2 , and there is a smaller open interval in the intersection of these two open intervals that contains x . This open interval lies in O1 ∩ O2 , so O1 ∩ O2 is open. Finally, condition (3) obviously holds for open sets in R .
In a similar fashion one can check that open sets in R2 or more generally Rn also satisfy (1)–(3).

Chapter 1

Notice that the intersection of an inﬁnite collection of open sets in R need not be open. For example, the intersection of all the open intervals (−1/n, 1/n) for n = 1, 2, ··· is the single point {0} which is not open. This explains why condition (2) is only for ﬁnite intersections.
It is always possible to construct at least two topologies on every set X by choos-
ing the collection O of open sets to be as large as possible or as small as possible:
The collection O of all subsets of X deﬁnes a topology on X called the discrete
topology.
If we let O consist of just X itself and ∅ , this deﬁnes a topology, the trivial
topology.
Thus we have three diﬀerent topologies on R , the usual topology, the discrete topology, and the trivial topology. Here are two more, the ﬁrst with fewer open sets than the usual topology, the second with more open sets:
Let O consist of the empty set together with all subsets of R whose complement
is ﬁnite. The axioms (1)–(3) are easily veriﬁed, and we leave this for the reader to
check. Every set in O is open in the usual topology, but not vice versa. Let O consist of all sets O such that for each x ∈ O there is an interval [a, b) with
x ∈ [a, b) ⊂ O . Properties (1)–(3) can be checked by almost the same argument as for the usual topology on R , and again we leave this for the reader to do. Intervals
[a, b) are certainly in O so this topology is diﬀerent from the usual topology on R . Every interval (a, b) is in O since it can be expressed as a union of a sequence of intervals [an, b) in O where the numbers an are chosen to satisfy a < an < b and to approach a from above. It follows that O contains all sets that are open
in the usual topology since these can be expressed as unions of intervals (a, b) .
These examples illustrate how one can have two topologies O and O′ on a set X , with every set that is open in the O topology is also open in the O′ topology, so O ⊂ O′ . In this situation we say that the topology O′ is ﬁner than O and that O is coarser than O′ . Thus the discrete topology on X is ﬁner than any other topology
and the trivial topology is coarser than any other topology. In the case X = R we have interpolated three other topologies between these two extremes, with the ﬁnitecomplement topology being coarser than the usual topology and the half-open-interval topology being ﬁner than the usual topology. In general, given two topologies on a set X , it need not be true that either one is ﬁner or coarser than the other.
Here is another piece of basic terminology:
Deﬁnition. A subset A of a topological space X is closed if its complement X − A is open.
For example, in R with the usual topology a closed interval [a, b] is a closed subset. Similarly, in R2 with its usual topology a closed disk, the union of an open disk with its boundary circle, is a closed subset.

Basic Point-Set Topology

Instead of deﬁning a topology on a set X to be a collection of open sets satisfying the three axioms we gave earlier, one could equally well consider the collection of complementary closed sets, and deﬁne a topology on X to be a collection of subsets called closed sets, such that the intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed, the union of any ﬁnite collection of closed sets is closed, and both the empty set and the whole set X are closed. Notice that the role of intersections and unions is switched compared with the original deﬁnition. This is because of the general set theory fact that the complement of a union is the intersection of the complements, and the complement of an intersection is the union of the complements.

Interior, Closure, and Boundary
Consider an open disk D in the plane R2 , consisting of all the points inside a circle C . We would like to assign precise meanings to certain intuitive statements like the following:
C is the boundary of the open disk D , and also of the closed disk D ∪ C . D is the interior of the closed disk D ∪ C , and D ∪ C is the closure of the open disk D .
The key distinction between points in the boundary of the disk and points in its interior is that for points in the boundary, every open set containing such a point also contains points inside the disk and points outside the disk, while each point in the interior of the disk lies in some open set entirely contained inside the disk.
With this observation in mind let us consider what happens in general. Given a subset A of a topological space X , then for each point x ∈ X exactly one of the following three possibilities holds:
(1) There exists an open set O in X with x ∈ O ⊂ A . (2) There exists an open set O in X with x ∈ O ⊂ X − A . (3) Every open set O with x ∈ O meets both A and X − A .
Points x such that (1) holds form a subset of A called the interior of A , written int(A) . The points where (2) holds then form int(X − A) . Points x where (3) holds form a set called the boundary or frontier of A , written ∂A . The points x where either (1) or (3) hold are the points x such that every open set O containing x meets A . Such points are called limit points of A , and the set of these limit points is called the closure of A , written A . Note that A ⊂ A , so we have int(A) ⊂ A ⊂ A = int(A) ∪ ∂A , this last union being a disjoint union. We will use the symbol ∐ to denote union of disjoint subsets when we want to emphasize the disjointness, so A = int(A) ∐ ∂A and X = int(A) ∐ ∂A ∐ int(X − A) .
As an example, in R with the usual topology the intervals (a, b) , [a, b] , [a, b) , and (a, b] all have interior (a, b) , closure [a, b] and boundary {a, b} . Similarly, in

6

Chapter 1

R2 with the usual topology, if A is the union of an open disk D with any subset of its boundary circle C then int(A) = D , A = D ∪ C , and ∂A = C . For a somewhat diﬀerent type of example, let A = Q in X = R with the usual topology on R . Then int(A) = ∅ and A = ∂A = R .
Proposition 1.1. For every subset A ⊂ X the following statements hold: (a) int(A) is open. (b) A is closed. (c) A is open if and only if A = int(A) . (d) A is closed if and only if A = A .

Proof. (a) If x is a point in int(A) then there is an open set Ox with x ∈ Ox ⊂ A . We have Ox ⊂ int(A) since for each y ∈ Ox , Ox is an open set with y ∈ Ox ⊂ A so y ∈ int(A) . It follows that int(A) = x Ox , the union as x ranges over all points of int(A) . This is a union of open sets and hence open.

(b) Since X = int(A) ∐ ∂A ∐ int(X − A) , we have A as the complement of int(X − A) , so A is closed, being the complement of an open set by part (a).

(c) If A = int(A) then A is open by (a). Conversely, suppose A is open. Then every x ∈ A is in int(A) since we can take O = A in condition (1). Thus A ⊂ int(A) . The opposite inclusion int(A) ⊂ A always holds, so A = int(A) .

(d) If A = A then A is closed by (b). Conversely, if A is closed then X − A is open, so

each point of X − A is contained in an open set disjoint from A , namely the set X − A

itself. This means that no point of X − A is a limit point of A , or in other words we

have A ⊂ A . We always have A ⊂ A , so A = A .

⊔⊓

A small caution: Some authors use the term ‘limit point’ in a more restricted

sense than we are using it here, requiring that every open set containing x contains

points of A other than x itself. Other names for this more restricted concept that one

sometimes ﬁnds are ‘point of accumulation’ and ‘cluster point’.

One might have expected the deﬁnition of a limit point to be expressed in terms

of convergent sequences of points. In an arbitrary topological space X it is natural to

Basis for a Topology

Many arguments with open sets in R reduce to looking at what happens with open intervals since open sets are deﬁned in terms of open intervals. A similar statement holds for R2 and Rn with open disks and balls in place of open intervals. In each case arbitrary open sets are unions of the special open sets given by open intervals, disks, or balls. This idea is expressed by the following terminology:
Deﬁnition. A collection B of open sets in a topological space X is called a basis for the topology if every open set in X is a union of sets in B.
A topological space can have many diﬀerent bases. For example, in R2 another basis besides the basis of open disks is the basis of open squares with edges parallel to the coordinate axes. Or we could take open squares with edges at 45 degree angles to the coordinate axes, or all open squares without restriction. Many other shapes besides squares could also be used. Another variation would be to ﬁx a number c > 0 and take just the open disks of radius less than c . These disks also form a basis for the topology on R2 .
If B is a basis for a topology on X , then B satisﬁes the following two properties:
(1) Every point x ∈ X lies in some set B ∈ B . (2) For each pair of sets B1 , B2 in B and each point x ∈ B1 ∩ B2 there exists a set B3
in B with x ∈ B3 ⊂ B1 ∩ B2 .
The ﬁrst statement holds since X is open and is therefore a union of sets in B . The second statement holds since B1 ∩ B2 is open and hence is a union of sets in B.
Proposition 1.2. If B is a collection of subsets of a set X satisfying (1) and (2) then B
is a basis for a topology on X .

The open sets in this topology have to be exactly the unions of sets in B since B
is a basis for this topology.

Proof. Let O be the collection of subsets of X that are unions of sets in B . Obviously

the union of any collection of sets in O is in O . To show the corresponding result for

ﬁnite intersections it suﬃces by induction to show that O1∩O2 ∈ O if O1, O2 ∈ O . For each x ∈ O1 ∩ O2 we can choose sets B1, B2 ∈ B with x ∈ B1 ⊂ O1 and x ∈ B2 ⊂ O2 . By (2) there exists a set B3 ∈ B with x ∈ B3 ⊂ B1 ∩ B2 ⊂ O1 ∩ O2 . The union of all such sets B3 as x ranges over O1 ∩ O2 is O1 ∩ O2 , so O1 ∩ O2 ∈ O .
Finally, X is in O by (1), and ∅ ∈ O since we can regard ∅ as the union of the

empty collection of subsets of B.

⊔⊓

We have frequently had to deal with open sets O containing a given point x . Such an open set is called a ‘neighborhood’ of x . Actually, it is useful to use the following broader deﬁnition:

8

Chapter 1

Deﬁnition. A neighborhood of a point x in a topological space X is any set A ⊂ X that contains an open set O containing x .
The more restricted kind of neighborhood can then be described as an open neighborhood.
As an example of the usefulness of this terminology, we can rephrase the condition for a point x to be a limit point of a set A to say that every open neighborhood of x meets A . The word ‘open’ here can in fact be omitted, for if every neighborhood of x meets A then in particular every open neighborhood meets A , and conversely, if every open neighborhood meets A then so does every other neighborhood since every neighborhood contains an open neighborhood.
Similarly, a boundary point of A is a point x such that every neighborhood of x meets both A and X − A .

Metric Spaces
The topology on Rn is deﬁned in terms of open balls, which in turn are deﬁned in terms of distance between points. There are many other spaces whose topology can be deﬁned in a similar way in terms of a suitable notion of distance between points in the space. Here is the ingredient needed to do this:
Deﬁnition. A metric on a set X is a function d : X × X→R such that
(1) d(x, y) ≥ 0 for all x, y ∈ X , with d(x, x) = 0 and d(x, y) > 0 if x = y .
(2) d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X . (3) d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y) for all x, y, z ∈ X .
This last condition is called the ‘triangle inequality’ because for the usual distance function in the plane it says that length of one side of a triangle is always less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.
Given a metric on X one deﬁnes the open ball of radius r centered at x to be the set Br (x) = { y ∈ X | d(x, y) < r } .
Proposition. The collection of all balls Br (x) for r > 0 and x ∈ X forms a basis for a topology on X .

A topological space together with a metric that deﬁnes the topology in this way is called a metric space.

Proof. First a preliminary observation: For a point y ∈ Br (x) the ball Bs(y) is contained in Br (x) if s ≤ r −d(x, y) , since for z ∈ Bs(y) we have d(z, y) < s and hence d(z, x) ≤ d(z, y) + d(y, x) < s + d(x, y) ≤ r .

Now to show the condition to have a basis is satisﬁed, suppose we are given a point

y ∈ Br1 (x1) ∩ Br2 (x2) . Then the observation in the preceding paragraph implies that

Bs(y ) ⊂ Br1 (x1) ∩ Br2 (x2) for any s ≤ min{r1 − d(x1, y ), r2 − d(x2, y )} .

⊔⊓

Diﬀerent metrics on the same set X can give rise to diﬀerent bases for the same topology. For example, in R2 the usual metric deﬁned in terms of lengths of vectors by d(x, y) = |x − y| has ‘balls’ which are disks, but another metric whose ‘balls’ are squares is d(x, y) = max{|x1 − y1|, |x2 − y2|} for x = (x1, y1) and y = (y1, y2) . We will leave it to the reader to verify that this satisﬁes the properties of a metric. Another metric is d(x, y) = |x1 − y1| + |x2 − y2| , which has balls that are also squares, but rotated 45 degrees from the squares in the previous metric.
Many important spaces that arise in the subject of Topology are metric spaces, but the point of view of Topology is to ignore any particular choice of metric as much as possible, and just focus on the open sets, on the topology itself.

Subspaces
We turn now to a topic which ought to be simple, and seems simple enough at
ﬁrst glance, but turns out to be a source of many headaches until one ﬁnally becomes
comfortable with it.
Given a topology O on a space X and a subset A ⊂ X , we would like to use
the topology on X to deﬁne a topology OA on A . There is an easy way to do this: Just deﬁne a set O ⊂ A to be in OA if there exists an open set O′ in O such that O = A ∩ O′ . Axiom (1) holds since if Oα = A ∩ Oα′ for sets Oα′ ∈ O then α Oα =
α(A ∩ Oα′ ) = A ∩ α Oα′ , so α Oα is in OA . Axiom (2) is similar since α Oα = α(A ∩ Oα′ ) = A ∩ α Oα′ , which is in OA if there are just ﬁnitely many indices α .
Axiom (3) is obvious.
The topology OA on A is called the subspace topology, and A with this topology
is called a subspace of X . For example, if we take X to be R2 with its usual topology, then every subset of R2 becomes a topological space. In particular, geometric ﬁgures
such as circles and polygons can now be viewed as topological spaces. Likewise, geometric ﬁgures in R3 such as spheres and polyhedra become topological spaces, with the subspace topology from the usual topology on R3 .
If B is a basis for the topology on X and A is a subspace of X , then we can obtain
a basis for the subspace topology on A by taking the collection BA of all intersections A ∩ B as B ranges over all the sets in B . This gives a basis for A because an arbitrary
open set in the subspace topology on A has the form A ∩ α Bα = α(A ∩ Bα) for
some collection of basis sets Bα ∈ B . In particular this says that for any subspace X
of Rn , a basis for the topology on X is the collection of open sets X ∩ B as B ranges over all open balls in Rn . For example, for a circle in R2 the open arcs in the circle
form a basis for its topology.
If X is a metric space, any subset A ⊂ X becomes a metric space by restricting the
metric X × X→R to A × A , since the three deﬁning properties of a metric obviously
still hold for the restricted distance function. The following Proposition gives some

10

Chapter 1

strong evidence that the subspace topology is a natural topology to use on subsets.
Proposition. The metric topology on a subset A of a metric space X is the same as the subspace topology.

Proof. Observe ﬁrst that for a ball Br (x) in X , the intersection A ∩ Br (x) consists of all points in A of distance less than r from x , so this is a ball in A regarded as a

metric space in itself. For a collection of such balls Brα (xα) we have

A ∩ Brα (xα) = A ∩ Brα (xα)

α

The left side of this equation is a typical open set in A with the subspace topology,

and the right side is a typical open set in the metric topology, so the two topologies

coincide.

⊔⊓

A subspace A ⊂ X whose subspace topology is the discrete topology is called a discrete subspace of X . This is equivalent to saying that for each point x ∈ A there is an open set in X whose intersection with A is just x . For example, Z is a discrete subspace of R , but Q is not discrete. The sequence 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 ··· without its limit 0 is a discrete subspace of R , but with 0 it is not discrete.
For a subspace A ⊂ X , a subset of A which is open or closed in A need not be open or closed in X . However, there are times when this is true:

Lemma. For an open set A ⊂ X , a subset B ⊂ A is open in the subspace topology on A if and only if B is open in X . This is also true when ‘open’ is replaced by ‘closed’ throughout the statement.

Proof. If B ⊂ A is open in A , it has the form A ∩ O for some open set O in X . This

intersection is open in X if A is open in X . Conversely, if B ⊂ A is open in X then

A ∩ B = B is open in A . (Note that the converse does not use the assumption that A

is open in X .) The argument for closed sets is just the same.

⊔⊓

Closures behave nicely with respect to subspaces:

Lemma. Given a space X , a subspace Y , and a subset A ⊂ Y , then the closure of A in the space Y is the intersection of the closure of A in X with Y .

This amounts to saying that a point y ∈ Y is a limit point of A in Y (i.e., using the subspace topology on Y ) if and only if y is a limit point of A in X .

Proof. For a point y ∈ Y to be a limit point of A in X means that every open set O

in X that contains y meets A . Since A ⊂ Y , this is equivalent to O ∩ Y meeting A ,

or in other words, that every open set in Y containing y meets A .

⊔⊓

The analogous statement for interiors is not true. For example, if A is a line segment in the x -axis in R2 , then the interior of A in the x -axis is an open interval, but the interior of A in R2 is empty.

Continuity and Homeomorphisms
Recall the deﬁnition: A function f : X→Y between topological spaces is contin-
uous if f −1(O) is open in X for each open set O in Y . For brevity, continuous functions are sometimes called maps or mappings. (A map in the everyday sense of the word is in fact a function from the points on the map to the points in whatever region is being represented by the map.)
Lemma. A function f : X→Y is continuous if and only if f −1(C) is closed in X for
each closed set C in Y .

Proof. An evident set-theory fact is that f −1(Y − A) = X − f −1(A) for each subset A

of Y . Suppose now that f is continuous. Then for any closed set C ⊂ Y , we have

Y − C open, hence the inverse image f −1(Y − C) = X − f −1(C) is open in X , so its

complement f −1(C) is closed. Conversely, if the inverse image of every closed set

is closed, then for O open in Y the complement Y − O is closed so f −1(Y − O) =

X − f −1(O) is closed and thus f −1(O) is open, so f is continuous.

⊔⊓

Here is another useful fact:
Lemma. Given a function f : X→Y and a basis B for Y , then f is continuous if and
only if f −1(B) is open in X for each B ∈ B .

Proof. One direction is obvious since the sets in B are open. In the other direction,

suppose f −1(B) is open for each B ∈ B . Then any open set O in Y is a union α Bα

of basis sets Bα , hence f −1(O) = f −1 α Bα = α f −1(Bα) is open in X , being a

union of the open sets f −1(Bα) .

⊔⊓

Lemma. If f : X→Y and g : Y →Z are continuous, then their composition gf : X→Z

is also continuous.

Proof. This uses the easy set-theory fact that (gf )−1(A) = f −1(g−1(A)) for any A ⊂

Z . Thus if f and g are continuous and A is open in Z then g−1(A) is open in Y so

f −1(g−1(A)) is open in X . This means gf is continuous.

⊔⊓

Lemma. If f : X→Y is continuous and A is a subspace of X , then the restriction f |A of f to A is continuous as a function A→Y .

Proof. For an open set O ⊂ Y we have (f |A)−1(O) = f −1(O) ∩ A , which is an open

set in A since f −1(O) is open in X .

⊔⊓

Deﬁnition. A continuous map f : X→Y is a homeomorphism if it is one-to-one and onto, and its inverse function f −1 : Y →X is also continuous.
[To be added: some examples of homeomorphisms, e.g., an open interval (a, b) is homeomorphic to R , an open ball in Rn is homeomorphic to Rn .]

Chapter 1

Product Spaces
Given two sets X and Y , their product is the set X × Y = { (x, y)|x ∈ X and y ∈ Y } . For example R2 = R × R , and more generally Rm × Rn = Rm+n . If X and
Y are topological spaces, we can deﬁne a topology on X × Y by saying that a basis consists of the subsets U × V as U ranges over open sets in X and V ranges over
open sets in Y . The criterion for a collection of subsets to be a basis for a topology is satisﬁed since (U1 × V1) ∩ (U2 × V2) = (U1 ∩ U2) × (V1 ∩ V2) . This is called the product topology on X × Y . The same topology could also be produced by taking
the smaller basis consisting of products U × V where U ranges over a basis for the
topology on X and V ranges over a basis for the topology on Y . This is because
( α Uα) × ( β Vβ) = α,β(Uα × Vβ) . For example, a basis for the product topology on R × R consists of the open
rectangles (a1, b1) × (a2, b2) . This is also a basis for the usual topology on R2 , so the product topology coincides with the usual topology.
More generally one can deﬁne the product X1 × ··· × Xn to consist of all ordered n -tuples (x1, ··· , xn) with xi ∈ Xi for each i . A basis for the product topology on X1 ×··· ×Xn consists of all products U1 ×··· ×Un as each Ui ranges over open sets in Xi , or just over a basis for the topology on Xi . Thus Rn with its usual topology is also describable as the product of n copies of R , with basis the open ‘boxes’ (a1, b1) × ··· × (an, bn) . Example. If we view points in the unit circle S1 in R2 as angles θ , then polar co-
ordinates give a homeomorphism f : S1 × (0, ∞)→R2 − {0} deﬁned by f (θ, r ) =
(r cos θ, r sin θ) . This is one-to-one and onto since each point in R2 other than the
origin has unique polar coordinates (θ, r ) . To see that f is a homeomorphism, just
observe that it takes a basis set U × V , where U is
an open interval (θ0, θ1) of θ values and V is an open interval (r0, r1) of r values, to an open ‘polar rectangle’ and such rectangles form a basis for the topology on R2 − {0} as a subspace of R2 . By restricting f to a product S1 × [a, b] for 0 < a < b
we obtain a homeomorphism from this product to a closed annulus in R2 , the region between two con-
centric circles.
More generally, Rn −{0} is homeomorphic to Sn−1 ×(0, ∞) where Sn−1 is the unit
sphere in Rn . Using vector notation, a homeomorphism f : Sn−1 × (0, ∞)→Rn − {0}
is given by f (v, r ) = r v , with inverse f −1(v) = (v/|v|, |v|) . The continuity of f and f −1 can be deduced from the explicit algebraic formulas for them, as we will see
later in this section.

Basic Point-Set Topology

Example. A product S1 × [a, b] is homeomorphic to a
cylinder as well as to an annulus. If we use cylindrical coordinates (r , θ, z) in R3 then a cylinder is speciﬁed by
taking r to be a constant r0 , letting θ range over the circle S1 , and restricting z to an interval [a, b] .

Example. The product S1 × S1 is homeomorphic to a torus, say the torus T in R3 ob-
tained by taking a circle C in the yz -plane disjoint from the z -axis and rotating this
circle about the z -axis. We can parametrize points on T by a pair of angles (θ1, θ2) where θ1 is the angle through which the yz -plane has been rotated and θ2 is the angle between the horizontal radial vec-
tor of C pointing away from the z -axis
and the radial vector to a given point of
C . One can think of θ1 and θ2 as longitude and latitude on T . A basic open set U × V in S1 × S1 is a product of two
open arcs, and this corresponds to an
open curvilinear rectangle on T . Such rectangles form a basis for the topology on T as a subspace of R3 , so it follows that T is homeomorphic to S1 × S1 .
A product space X × Y has two projection maps p1 : X × Y →X and p2 : X × Y →Y
deﬁned by p1(x, y) = x and p2(x, y) = y . These maps are continuous since if U ⊂ X is open then so is p1−1(U) = U × Y , and if V ⊂ Y is open then so is p2−1(V ) = X × V .
For each y ∈ Y there is an inclusion map iy : X→X × Y given by iy (x) = (x, y) .
This is continuous because i−y1(U × V ) is either U if y ∈ V or ∅ if y ∉ V . The map iy is a homeomorphism onto its image X × {y} since it has a continuous inverse, the restriction of the projection p1 to X × {y} . One can think of X × Y as the union of the family of subspaces X × {y} , each homeomorphic to X , with one such subspace
for each y ∈ Y . The situation is of course symmetric with respect to interchanging
X and Y , so for each x ∈ X there is a continuous inclusion map ix : Y →X × Y which
is a homeomorphism onto its image {x} × Y , and X × Y is the union of these copies
of the space X , one for each point of Y .
A function f : Z→X × Y has the form f (z) = (f1(z), f2(z)) . A basic property of
the product topology on X × Y is:
Proposition. A function f : Z→X × Y is continuous if and only if its component functions f1 : Z→X and f2 : Z→Y are both continuous.

Proof. We have f1 = p1f and f2 = p2f so f1 and f2 are continuous if f is continuous. For the converse, note that f −1(U × V ) = f1−1(U) ∩ f2−1(V ) , so this will be open

if U and V are open and f1 and f2 are continuous.

Chapter 1

As an application, we can give a topological proof that a function Rn→R given
by a polynomial in n variables is continuous. The ﬁrst step is the following fact:
If two functions f , g : Rn→R are continuous, then so also are the sum function
f +g and the product function f ·g . Namely, we can view f +g as the composition
Rn→R × R→R where the ﬁrst map is x ֏ (f (x), g(x)) and the second map is (x, y) ֏ x + y . We know the ﬁrst map is continuous if f and g are continuous,
and it is easy to check that the second map is continuous by seeing directly that the inverse image of an open interval is open. For f · g the argument is similar,
replacing the second map by the product map (x, y) ֏ xy .
A general polynomial in n variables is built up using repeated addition and multipli-
cation from constant functions, which are certainly continuous, and the coordinate functions xi , which are nothing but the projections of Rn onto its n R factors so are continuous as well.

Chapter 2

Chapter 2. Connectedness
Some spaces are in a sense ‘disconnected’, being the union of two or more completely separate subspaces. For example the space X ⊂ R consisting of the two intervals A = [0, 1] and B = [2, 3] should certainly be disconnected, and so should a subspace X of R2 which is the union of two disjoint circles A and B . As these examples show, it is reasonable to interpret the idea of A and B being ‘completely separate’ as saying not only that they are disjoint, but no point of A is a limit point of B and no point of B is a limit point of A . Since we are assuming that X is the union of A and B , this is equivalent to saying that A and B each contain all their limit points. In other words, A and B are both closed subsets of X . Since each of A and B is the complement of the other, it would be equivalent to say that both A and B are open sets. Thus we have arrived at the following basic deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition. A space X is connected if it cannot be decomposed as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. This is equivalent to saying X cannot be decomposed as the union of two disjoint nonempty closed sets.
A third equivalent condition is that the only sets in X that are both open and closed are ∅ and X itself. For if A were any other set that was both open and closed, then X would be decomposed as the union of the disjoint nonempty open sets A and X − A . Conversely, if X were the disjoint union of the nonempty open sets A and B then A would be closed as well as open, being equal to the complement of B , and A would be neither ∅ nor X .
Example. The subspace of R consisting of the rational numbers Q is not connected, since we can decompose it as the union of the two open sets Q ∩ (−∞, √2) and Q ∩ (√2, ∞) . More generally, any subspace X ⊂ R that is not an interval is not connected. For if X is not an interval, then there exist numbers a < c < b with a, b ∈ X but c ∉ X , so X is the disjoint union of the open sets X ∩ (−∞, c) and X ∩ (c, ∞) . We will see below that intervals in R are in fact connected.
Example. If we give R the topology having as basis all the intervals [a, b) , then with this topology R is not connected, because the intervals [a, b) are closed as well as open since their complements (−∞, a)∪[b, ∞) are open, being the unions of the basis intervals [a − n, a) and [b, b + n) for n = 1, 2, ··· .
Now we return to the usual topology on R to prove an extremely fundamental result:
Theorem. An interval [a, b] in R is connected.

Proof. We may assume a < b since it is obvious that [a, a] is connected. Suppose [a, b] is decomposed as the disjoint union of sets A and B that are open in [a, b] with the subspace topology, so they are also closed in [a, b] . After possibly changing

Connectedness

17

notation we may assume that a is in A . Since A is open in [a, b] there is an interval

[a, a + ε) contained in A for some ε > 0 , and hence there is an interval [a, c] ⊂ A ,

with a < c . The set C = { c | [a, c] ⊂ A } is bounded above by b , so it has a least

upper bound L ≤ b . (A fundamental property of R is that any set that is bounded

above has a least upper bound.) We know that L > a by the earlier observation that

there is an interval [a, c] ⊂ A with c > a . Since no number smaller than L is an

upper bound for C , there exist intervals [a, c] ⊂ A with c ≤ L and c arbitrarily close

to L . These numbers c are in A , hence L must also be in A since A is closed. Thus

we have [a, L] ⊂ A . Now if we assume that L < b we can derive a contradiction in

the following way. Since A is open and contains [a, L] , it follows that A contains

[a, L + ε] for some ε > 0 . But this means that C contains numbers bigger than L ,

contradicting the fact that L was an upper bound for C . Thus the assumption L < b

leads to a contradiction, so we must conclude that L = b since we know L ≤ b . We

already saw that [a, L] ⊂ A , so now we have [a, b] ⊂ A . This means that B must be

empty, and we have shown that it is impossible to decompose [a, b] into two disjoint

nonempty open sets. Hence [a, b] is connected.

⊔⊓

Path-connected Spaces
Here is another kind of connectedness that is often easier to deal with: Deﬁnition. A space X is path-connected if for each pair of points a, b ∈ X there
exists a path in X from a to b , that is, a continuous map f : [0, 1]→X with f (0) = a
and f (1) = b . The choice of the interval [0, 1] rather than some other closed interval as the
domain of f is not of much importance. All closed intervals are homeomorphic, so it is easy to change from one domain interval to another.
Often it is easy to see ‘by inspection’ that a given space is path-connected. This then tells us more:
Proposition. If a space is path-connected, then it is connected.

Proof. To argue by contradiction, suppose X is the disjoint union of nonempty open

sets A and B . Choose a point a ∈ A and a point b ∈ B . If X is path-connected there
is a path f : [0, 1]→X from a to b . Then f −1(A) and f −1(B) are nonempty disjoint

open sets in [0, 1] whose union is all of [0, 1] , contradicting the fact that [0, 1] is

connected, proved in the previous theorem.

⊔⊓

This implies for example that all intervals, not just closed intervals, are connected since it is obvious that they are path-connected. Likewise circles are path-connected and hence connected. Another example is Rn , where any two points a and b can be joined by the path obtained by parametrizing the straight line segment joining them,

18

Chapter 2

say by the function f (t) = (1 − t)a + tb , in vector notation. The same construction shows that a subspace X ⊂ Rn is path-connected if it is convex, meaning that the line segment joining any two points in X also lies in X . For example, the union of an open ball in Rn with any subset of its boundary sphere is convex and hence path-connected.
We will give an example below of a connected space that is not path-connected, so the converse of the preceding proposition fails to hold in general.
Proposition. Suppose f : X→Y is continuous and onto. Then:
(a) If X is connected, so is Y . (b) If X is path-connected, so is Y .

Proof. (a) Suppose Y is the union of disjoint nonempty open sets A and B . Then X is the union of the disjoint open sets f −1(A) and f −1(B) , which are both nonempty

if f is onto.
(b) For any points a, b ∈ Y there exist points a′, b′ ∈ X with f (a′) = a and f (b′) = b
since f is onto. If X is path-connected there is a path g : [0, 1]→X from a′ to b′ . Then the composition f g : [0, 1]→Y is a path in Y from a to b , so Y is path-

connected.

⊔⊓

A consequence of this proposition is that if two spaces are homeomorphic and one is connected, then so is the other, and the same holds also with ‘path-connected’ in place of ‘connected’. This gives a way of showing that two spaces are not homeomorphic, if one is connected or path-connected and the other is not.

Cut Points
There is a more reﬁned way to apply this fact that connectedness is preserved by homeomorphisms, using the following idea. In a connected space X , a point x ∈ X is called a cut point if removing x from X produces a disconnected space X − {x} .
Note that if f : X→Y is a homeomorphism, then a point x ∈ X is a cut point of X if
and only if f (x) is a cut point of Y , since X − {x} and Y − {f (x)} are homeomorphic via the restriction of f . Thus by counting numbers of cut points and non-cut points we can sometimes show that two spaces are not homeomorphic. Some examples are given in the table on the next page.
Cut points can also be used to show that R is not homeomorphic to Rn for n > 1 , since the latter spaces have no cut points whereas in R every point is a cut point. It is true more generally that Rm is not homeomorphic to Rn if m = n , but this is a much harder theorem. To distinguish R2 from R3 for example, one might try to use ‘cut curves’ instead of cut points, motivated by the fact that the complement of a line in R2 is disconnected whereas the complement of a line in R3 is connected. However, a hypothetical homeomorphism from R2 to R3 might take a line to a very complicated

Connectedness

19

curve which might conceivably wander around so badly that its complement was not connected, unlike the complement of a straight line. To prove that this can’t happen takes quite a bit of work, and the best way to do it is to develop some heavy machinery ﬁrst, the machinery in a branch of topology called algebraic topology.

Connected Components and Path Components
We will show that if a space X is not connected, then it decomposes as the union of a collection of disjoint connected subspaces that are maximal in the sense that none of them is contained in any larger connected subspace. These maximal connected subspaces are called the connected components of X . Similarly, if X is not pathconnected, it decomposes as the union of disjoint maximal path-connected subspaces called path components.
Let us begin by talking about path components. For a point x ∈ X let P (x) be the subspace of X consisting of points y such that there is a path in X from x to y . This path in fact lies in P (x) since any point along the path is joined to x by an initial segment of the path. Notice also that any two points y and z in P (x) can be joined by a path in P (x) since if f is a path from x to y and g is a path from x to z then we obtain a path from y to z by ﬁrst going backward along f from y to x and then forward along g from x to z .
Here is the key fact about the subspaces P (x) :
Lemma. If P (x) ∩ P (y) = ∅ then P (x) = P (y) .
Proof. Suppose there is a point z ∈ P (x) ∩ P (y) . This means there are paths from

20

Chapter 2

x and y to z . If w is any point in P (x) , then there is a path from x to w , and

hence also a path from y to w by going ﬁrst from

y to z , then to x , then to w . Thus P (x) ⊂ P (y) .

The same argument shows that P (y) ⊂ P (x) , so

P (x) = P (y) .

⊔⊓

The lemma implies that the subspaces P (x) that are distinct provide a decomposition of X into a collection of disjoint subspaces. Each P (x) is path-connected, and if A is any path-connected subspace of X then A must be contained in some P (x) since if x ∈ A then all points in A can be connected to x by a path, so A ⊂ P (x) . This shows that the subspaces P (x) are the maximal path-connected subspaces of X . They are called the path components of X .
Note that a continuous map f : X→Y takes each path component of X into some
path component of Y . This is because a path component P (x) is path-connected so its image f (P (x)) must also be path-connected, hence f (P (x)) must be contained in some path component of Y . In fact it will be contained in P (f (x)) since it contains the point f (x) .
Example. Let X be the subspace of R2
which is the closure of the graph of the function f (x) = sin(1/x) for x > 0 . Thus X consists of this graph together with the line segment A in the y -axis from (0, −1) to (0, 1) . Let B denote the graph of f itself, so X is the disjoint union of A and B . Obviously A and B are both path-connected. We will show that X itself is not path-connected, hence A and B are the two path components of X
Let f : [0, 1]→X be a path starting at a point in A . We know that f −1(A) is closed
since A is closed. We will show that f −1(A) is also open. This implies f −1(A) = [0, 1] since [0, 1] is connected and f −1(A) is nonempty. The equation f −1(A) = [0, 1] says that f ([0, 1]) ⊂ A , and thus there is no path in X joining a point in A to a point in B . To show that f −1(A) is open let t0 be any point in f −1(A) . Choose a small open disk D in R2 centered at f (t0) . Then D ∩ X has inﬁnitely many path-components, one of which is D ∩ A . Since f is continuous, f −1(D) is an open set in [0, 1] containing t0 , so there is an interval I ⊂ [0, 1] which is open in [0, 1] , contains t0 , and is contained in f −1(D) . This interval is path-connected, so its image f (I) is also path-connected and therefore lies inside one of the path components of D ∩ X . This path component contains the point f (t0) ∈ A so it has to be the path component D ∩ A . This says that f (I) ⊂ A , or in other words I ⊂ f −1(A) . Thus f −1(A) contains a neighborhood of t0 in [0, 1] . Since t0 was an arbitrary point of f −1(A) we conclude that f −1(A) is open in [0, 1] , ﬁnishing the argument.
To determine whether the space X in this example is connected we will use the

Connectedness

21

following general fact: Lemma. If a subspace A of a space X is connected, then so is A .

Proof. Suppose A is the disjoint union of subsets B and C which are closed in A and

hence also closed in X since A is closed in X . Then A∩B and A∩C are disjoint closed

sets in A whose union is A , so one of these two sets must equal A , say A ∩ B = A .

This says A ⊂ B , so A ⊂ B = B . Since we originally had A = B ∐ C this implies B = A

and C = ∅ .

⊔⊓

From this lemma we can conclude that the space X in the preceding example is connected since it is the closure of the subspace B which is path-connected and hence connected. Thus X is an example of a space which is connected but not pathconnected. Another example, very similar to this one, would be the closure of the graph of the function r = θ/(θ + 1) for θ ≥ 0 , in polar coordinates. This space consists of a circle together with a curve that spirals out to it from inside.
Now we turn to the question of decomposing a space X into maximal connected subspaces.

Lemma. If a subset A of a space X is both open and closed, then any connected subspace C ⊂ X which meets A must be contained in A .

Proof. If A is open and closed in X then C ∩ A is open and closed in C . If C is

connected this implies that C ∩ A = C , which says that C is contained in A .

⊔⊓

Proposition. If {Cα} is a family of connected subspaces of a space X , any two of which have nonempty intersection, then α Cα is connected.

Proof. Let Y = α Cα and let A ⊂ Y be open and closed in Y . Then A ∩ Cα is open and closed in Cα for each α , hence is either ∅ or Cα . If A = ∅ choose a point x ∈ A . Since A ⊂ Y and Y is the union of all the Cα ’s we have x ∈ Cα for some α . Thus A ∩ Cα = ∅ , so by the preceding lemma we must have Cα ⊂ A . Any other Cβ meets Cα by assumption, hence meets A and so is contained in A by the Lemma again. Thus Y , the union of the Cα ’s, is contained in A . We were assuming A ⊂ Y , so we have A = Y . Since A was any nonempty closed and open set in Y , we conclude that Y is

connected.

⊔⊓

We can apply the proposition to the collection of all connected subsets Cα of X that contain a given point x , to conclude that the union of all these subsets is connected. Call this union C(x) . It is obviously the largest connected set in X containing x since it contains every connected set that contains x . Obviously C(x) is also the largest connected set containing any other point y ∈ C(x) , since a larger connected set containing y would also be a larger connected set containing x . It follows that X

22

Chapter 2

is the disjoint union of all the diﬀerent sets C(x) . These are the maximal connected sets in X , the connected components of X .
Note that the connected components of X are closed subsets by the earlier fact that if a subspace A ⊂ X is connected then so is its closure. Connected components do not have to be open, however. For example, consider the rational numbers Q , topologized as a subspace of R . We know from earlier that the only connected subspaces of R are intervals, including the degenerate intervals [a, a] . Since Q contains no nondegenerate intervals, it follows that the only connected subspaces of Q are points. Thus the connected components of Q are just the individual points of Q , since connected components are maximal connected subspaces. The connected components of Q are therefore not open subsets of Q .
Path components do not have to be either open or closed, as one can see in the example of the closure of the graph of sin(1/x) . This graph is a path component that is open but not closed, while the remaining line segment of the space is a path component that is closed but not open.
Each path component of a space is contained in a connected component since path-connected subspaces are connected, hence are contained in maximal connected subspaces, the connected components. One commonly encountered situation where path components are the same as connected components is given by the following result:
Proposition. If each point in a space X has a neighborhood which is path-connected, then the path components of X are also the connected components.

Proof. The hypothesis guarantees that path components are open subsets. This im-

plies that they are also closed since the complement of a path component is a union

of path components and hence is open. Any connected set must intersect some path

component and hence be contained in it by the previous lemma, so the connected

components are contained in the path components.

⊔⊓

This proposition applies for example to an open set X in Rn , since each point in X then has a neighborhood which is a ball, which is path-connected. Notice that the proposition deﬁnitely does not apply to the closure of the sin(1/x) graph.

The Cantor Set
A space X whose connected components are points is said to be totally disconnected. This is equivalent to saying that the only connected subspaces of X are points, since connected components are maximal connected subspaces. As a trivial example, a space with the discrete topology is certainly totally disconnected since every subset is open and closed, so no subspace with more than one point can be connected.

Connectedness

For a subspace of R to be totally disconnected means that it contains no intervals, other than points, since the only connected subspaces of R are intervals. We mentioned the example of Q previously, but there are many other totally disconnected
subspaces of R . For a start, one can have subspaces such as the integers where every point is isolated, being both open and closed. This is just saying that the subspace
topology is the discrete topology, so one has a discrete subspace.
Let us ask the following question: Is there a totally disconnected subspace of R which is closed in R but contains no isolated points. Such a subspace would thus
combine features of both the integers (a closed subspace) and the rationals (a subspace with no isolated points). The answer to the question is yes, and there is a famous example which we will now describe, known as the Cantor set.
The Cantor set C is a subspace of [0, 1] constructed as an intersection of an inﬁnite sequence of sets C0 ⊃ C1 ⊃ C2 ⊃ ··· . We start with C0 = [0, 1] , and we form C1 by removing the open interval (1/3, 2/3) , so C1 = [0, 1/3] ∪ [2/3, 1] . Next we form C2 by removing the open middle thirds (1/9, 2/9) and (7/9, 8/9) of the two intervals of C1 . This leaves the four closed intervals [0, 1/9] , [2/9, 1/3] , [2/3, 7/9] , and [8/9, 1] . Now we repeat the same process over and over again, at each stage removing the open middle thirds of each interval created at the previous stage. Thus Cn consists of 2n closed intervals of length 1/3n . Finally we set C = n Cn . This is a closed subset of R , being the intersection of the closed subsets Cn .
The set C is totally disconnected since it was constructed so as to contain no intervals other than points. Namely, if C contained an interval of positive length ε then this interval would be contained in each Cn , but Cn contains no interval of length greater than 1/3n so if n is chosen to be large enough so that 1/3n is less than ε , then there is no interval of length ε in Cn .
Now let us check that C contains no isolated points. Each point x in C is in the intersection of all the Cn ’s so it is in the intersection of the sequence of interval components In of Cn that contain x . If we let xn be either endpoint of In then x = lim xn since the lengths of the In ’s are approaching 0 . We can assume x = xn for all n since we have two choices for each xn so we can always choose one of them diﬀerent from x if x happens to be an endpoint of some In . All the endpoints of the In ’s are contained in C , so this shows that each x ∈ C is a limit of a sequence of points xn ∈ C diﬀerent from x . This shows that C contains no isolated points.
There is a nice way of characterizing which points of [0, 1] lie in C in terms of base 3 decimals. The middle-third interval (1/3, 2/3) consists of base 3 decimals .a1a2 ··· with a1 = 1 , excluding only the decimal .1 = 1/3 . Thus C1 consists of the decimals .a1a2 ··· with a1 = 1 , including 1/3 as .0222 ··· and 1 as .222 ··· . In similar fashion C2 consists of decimals .a1a2 ··· with a1 = 1 and a2 = 1 . More generally Cn consists of decimals .a1a2 ··· with none of a1, ··· , an equal to 1 . Hence C consists exactly of all decimals .a1a2 ··· with no ai equal to 1 . The points of C

24

Chapter 2

that are endpoints of an interval component of some Cn are the decimals ending either in all 0 ’s or all 2 ’s.

It is interesting to think of the process of constructing C in physical terms as

taking a length of string and repeatedly cutting it into shorter pieces. If we think of

the ﬁrst piece as the interval [0, 1] and cut it at the point 1/2 , then it becomes two

pieces of string each with two endpoints. In eﬀect the single point 1/2 has become two

points, the two new endpoints of the half pieces, the intervals [0, 1/2] and [1/2, 1] .

At the next stage one cuts each of these two pieces in half, producing four separate

pieces [0, 1/4] , [1/4, 1/2] , [1/2, 3/4] , and [3/4, 1] , and so on for later stages. In

order to make all these pieces disjoint subsets of R one can image the string as being

stretched so tightly that each time it is cut, it pulls apart at the cut and shrinks to

two-thirds of its length, so after the ﬁrst cut, [0, 1/2] shrinks to [0, 1/3] and [1/2, 1]

shrinks to [2/3, 1] . Then at the next stage we cut [0, 1/3] at its midpoint and the two

pieces [0, 1/6] and [1/6, 1/3] shrink to [0, 1/9] and [2/9, 1/3] , and similarly for the

piece [2/3, 1] , and so on.

All this cutting and shrinking can be described very neatly in terms of decimal

expansions. Initially we cut [0, 1] at 1/2 producing two copies of the point 1/2 . If we

use base 2 decimals, then these two copies of 1/2 can be distinguished by regarding

one of them as .0111 ··· and the other one as .1000 ···. Normally these two decimals

are regarded as the same number, but now we want to keep them distinct, viewing

them as the two new endpoints of the cut string. Similarly at the next stage the point

1/4 duplicates itself as the two decimals .00111 ··· and .01000 ···, and the point 3/4

duplicates itself as .10111 ··· and .11000 ···, etc. The process of shrinking pieces to

two-thirds of their lengths can then be achieved by simply changing the decimal base

2 to 3 and replacing all decimal digits 1 by 2 .

Here is a question for the reader to ponder: What happens if we do not replace

decimal digits 1 by 2 but simply consider all base 3 decimals consisting of 0 ’s and

1 ’s, with no 2 ’s? How does the resulting set compare with the Cantor set?

We can determine the total length of the Cantor set by adding up the lengths of

the complementary deleted intervals. First we deleted an interval of length 1/3 , then

2 intervals of length 1/9 , then 4 intervals of length 1/27 , and so on. Thus the total

length deleted is the sum of the series

+

4 27

+

···,

which

is

a

geometric

series

with initial term 1/3 and ratio 2/3 so the sum is 1 . Thus the total length of C is 0 .

Another way to see this is to observe that the length of Cn is 2/3 of the length of Cn−1 , so the length of Cn is (2/3)n , which approaches 0 as n goes to inﬁnity.

One can imagine many similar constructions of sets that look much like the Cantor set. For example, instead of removing middle thirds at each step one could remove middle halves or middle quarters, or any other fractions. The fractions could even vary from one step to the next. Or instead of removing a single middle interval from each interval, one could remove several interior open intervals, provided that the lengths

25

of the remaining intervals approach zero. Interestingly enough, all these constructions produce ‘Cantor sets’ that are homeomorphic to the original Cantor set C . In fact, it is possible to list several properties that the Cantor set has, including being totally disconnected and having no isolated points, such that every space with these properties is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. We will study the other properties in the next couple chapters, and eventually (hopefully) prove the theorem that the list of properties characterizes the Cantor set up to homeomorphism.

Compactness

27

Chapter 3. Compactness
Compactness is a sort of ﬁniteness property that some spaces have and others do not. The rough idea is that spaces which are ‘inﬁnitely large’ such as R or [0, ∞) are not compact. However, we want compactness to depend just on the topology on a space, so it will have to be deﬁned purely in terms of open sets. This means that any space homeomorphic to a noncompact space will also be noncompact, so ﬁnite intervals (a, b) and [a, b) will also be noncompact in spite of their ‘ﬁniteness’. On the other hand, closed intervals [a, b] will be compact — they cannot be stretched to be ‘inﬁnitely large’.
How can this idea be expressed just in terms of open sets rather than in some numerical measure of size? This would seem to be diﬃcult since open sets themselves can be large or small. But large open sets can be expressed as unions of small open sets, so perhaps we should think about counting how many small open sets are needed when a large open set in a space X , such as the whole space X itself, is expressed as a union of small open sets. The most basic question in this situation is whether the number of small open sets needed is ﬁnite or inﬁnite. For example, if X is a metric space, then X is the union of all its balls Bε(x) of ﬁxed radius ε > 0 , so we could ask whether X is in fact the union of a ﬁnite collection of these balls Bε(x) of ﬁxed radius. To generalize this idea to arbitrary spaces which need not have a metric, we replace balls by arbitrary open sets, and this leads to the following general deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition. A space X is compact if for each collection of open sets Oα in X whose union is X , there exist a ﬁnite number of these Oα ’s whose union is X .
More concisely, one says that every open cover of X has a ﬁnite subcover, where an open cover of X is a collection of open sets in X whose union is X , and a ﬁnite subcover is a ﬁnite subcollection whose union is still X .
For example, R is not compact because the cover by the open intervals (−n, n) for n = 1, 2, ··· has no ﬁnite subcover, since inﬁnitely many of these intervals are needed to cover all of R . Another open cover which has no ﬁnite subcover is the collection of intervals (n − 1, n + 1) for n ∈ Z .
In a similar vein, the interval (0, 1) fails to be compact since the cover by the open intervals (1/n, 1) for n ≥ 1 has no ﬁnite subcover. Of course, there do exist open covers of (0, 1) which have ﬁnite subcovers, for example the cover by (0, 1) itself, or a little less trivially, the cover by all open subintervals of ﬁxed length, say 1/4 , which has the ﬁnite subcover (0, 1/4) , (1/8, 3/8) , (1/4, 1/2) , (3/8, 5/8) , (1/2, 3/4) , (5/8, 7/8) , (3/4, 1) . To be compact means that every possible open cover has a ﬁnite subcover. This could be diﬃcult to check in individual cases, so we will develop general theorems to test for compactness.

28

Chapter 3

Compact Sets in Euclidean Space
Spaces with only ﬁnitely many points are obviously compact, or more generally spaces whose topology has only ﬁnitely many open sets. However, such spaces are not very interesting. Our goal in this section will be to characterize exactly which subspaces of Rn are compact. We start with an important special case:
Theorem. A closed interval [a, b] is compact.

Proof. This will be somewhat similar in ﬂavor to the proof we gave that closed intervals

are connected. The case a = b is trivial, so we may assume a < b . Let a cover of

[a, b] by open sets Oα in [a, b] be given. Since a ∈ Oα for some α , there exists c > a such that the interval [a, c] is contained in this Oα , and hence [a, c] is contained in the union of ﬁnitely many Oα ’s. Let L be the least upper bound of the set of numbers c ∈ [a, b] such that [a, c] is contained in the union of ﬁnitely many Oα ’s. We know that L > a by the preceding remarks, and by the deﬁnition of L we certainly have

L ≤ b.

There is some Oα , call it Oβ , that contains L . This Oβ is open in [a, b] , so since L > a there is an interval [L − ε, L] contained in Oβ for some ε > 0 . By the deﬁnition of L there exist numbers c < L arbitrarily close to L such that [a, c] is contained

in the union of ﬁnitely many Oα ’s. In particular, there are such numbers c in the interval [L − ε, L] . For such a c we can take a ﬁnite collection of Oα ’s whose union contains [a, c] and add the set Oβ containing [L − ε, L] to this collection to obtain a ﬁnite collection of Oα ’s containing the interval [a, L] . If L = b we would now be done, so it remains only to show that L < b is not possible.

If L < b , the number ε could have been chosen so that not only is [L − ε, L] ⊂ Oβ but also [L − ε, L + ε] ⊂ Oβ , since Oβ is open in [a, b] . Then by adding Oβ to the ﬁnite collection of Oα ’s whose union contains [a, c] , as in the preceding paragraph, we would have a ﬁnite collection of Oα ’s whose union contains [a, L + ε] . However, this means that L is not an upper bound for the set of c ’s such that [a, c] is contained

in a ﬁnite union of Oα ’s. This contradiction shows that L < b is not possible, so we

must have L = b .

⊔⊓

For a subspace A of a space X to be compact means of course that every open cover of A has a ﬁnite subcover. The open cover of A would consist of sets of the form A ∩ Oα for Oα open in X . To say that A = α(A ∩ Oα) is equivalent to saying that A ⊂ α Oα . Thus for A to be compact means that for every collection of open sets in X whose union contains A , there is a ﬁnite subcollection whose union contains A . So it does no harm to interpret ‘every open cover of A has a ﬁnite subcover’ to mean precisely this.

Proposition. A closed subset of a compact space is compact, in the subspace topology.

Compactness

29

Proof. Let {Oα} be a cover of A by open sets in X . We then obtain an open cover of X by adding the set X − A , which is open if A is closed. If X is compact this open

cover of X has a ﬁnite subcover. The sets Oα in this ﬁnite subcover then give a ﬁnite

cover of A since the set X − A contributes nothing to covering A .

⊔⊓

As an example, the Cantor set is closed in [0, 1] , so it is compact because [0, 1] is compact.
Here is another way to show that a space is compact:
Proposition. If f : X→Y is continuous and onto, and if X is compact, then so is Y .

Proof. Let a cover of Y by open sets Oα be given. Then the sets f −1(Oα) form an

open cover of X . If X is compact, this cover has a ﬁnite subcover. Call this ﬁnite

subcover f −1(O1), ··· , f −1(On) . Assuming that f is onto, the corresponding sets

O1, ··· , On then cover Y since for each y ∈ Y there exists x ∈ X with f (x) = y , and this x will be in some set f −1(Oi) of the ﬁnite cover of X , so y will be in the

corresponding set Oi .

⊔⊓

This implies for example that a circle is compact since it is the image of a contin-
uous map f : [0, 1]→R2 .
In order to expand our range of compact spaces we use the notion of product
spaces, introduced in Chapter 1.

Theorem. If X and Y are compact then so is their product X × Y .

By induction this implies that the product of any ﬁnite collection of compact spaces is compact.

Proof. Let a cover of X×Y by open sets Oα in X×Y be given. Each point (x, y) ∈ X×Y

lies in some Oα , and this Oα is a union of basis sets U × V , so there exists a basis set

Uxy × Vxy containing (x, y) and contained in some Oα .

Suppose we choose a ﬁxed x and let y vary. Then the sets Uxy × Vxy cover

{x} × Y , so the sets Vxy with ﬁxed x and varying y form an open cover of Y . Since

Y is compact, this cover has a ﬁnite subcover Vxy1 , ··· , Vxyn , where n may depend

on x . The intersection Ux =

n j=1

Uxyj

is then an open set containing

x

with two key

properties: The sets Ux × Vxy1 , ··· , Ux × Vxyn cover Ux × Y , and each Ux × Vxyj is

contained in some Oα .

Now we let x vary. The sets Ux form an open cover of X , so since X is compact

there is a ﬁnite subcover Ux1 , ··· , Uxm . The products Uxi × Vxiyj of the sets Uxi with

the corresponding sets Vxiyj chosen earlier then form a ﬁnite cover of X × Y . Each

set in this ﬁnite cover is contained in some Oα , so by choosing an Oα containing each

Uxi × Vxiyj we obtain a ﬁnite cover of X × Y .

⊔⊓

We can use this result to determine exactly which subspaces of Rn are compact.

The result is usually called the Heine-Borel Theorem.

30

Chapter 3

Theorem. A subspace X ⊂ Rn is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
For a subset X ⊂ Rn to be bounded means that it lies inside some ball of ﬁnite radius centered at the origin.

Proof. First let us assemble previously-proved results to show the ‘if’ half of the the-

orem. If we assume X is bounded, then it lies in a ball of ﬁnite radius and hence in

some closed cube [−r , r ] × ··· × [−r , r ] . This cube is compact, being a product of

closed intervals which are compact. Since X is a closed subset of a compact space, it

is also compact.

Now for the converse, suppose X is compact. The collection of all open balls in Rn centered at the origin and of arbitrary radius forms an open cover of X , so there

is a ﬁnite subcover, which means X is contained in a single ball of ﬁnite radius, the

largest radius of the ﬁnitely many balls covering X . Hence X is bounded.

To show X is closed if it is compact, suppose x is a limit point of X that is not

in X . Then every neighborhood of x contains points of X . In particular each open

ball Br (x) of radius r centered at x contains points of X , so the same is true also for the closed balls Br (x) . The complements Rn − Br (x) form an open cover of X as r varies over (0, ∞) since their union is Rn − {x} and x ∉ X . This open cover of X

has no ﬁnite subcover since each Br contains points of X . Thus we have shown that

if X is not closed, it is not compact.

⊔⊓

Hausdorﬀ Spaces
We showed earlier that a compact subspace of Rn is closed. This is not something that remains true when Rn is replaced by an arbitrary space X . For example if X is a ﬁnite set with any topology then every subspace of X is compact since X has only ﬁnitely many subsets in total, but not every subset of X will be closed unless X has the discrete topology. Fortunately there is a fairly simple and natural condition to impose on a topology which will guarantee that compact subspaces are closed:
Deﬁnition. A topological space X is a Hausdorﬀ space if for each pair of distinct points x, y ∈ X there exist open neighborhoods U of x and V of y that are disjoint.
For example, every metric space X is a Hausdorﬀ space since if x and y are distinct points in X then the open balls of radius ε centered at x and y will be disjoint if ε is less than half the distance between x and y . This follows from the triangle inequality, since if there were a point z in the intersection of these two balls, then the distances between x , y , and z would satisfy d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y) < ε + ε = 2ε < d(x, y) , a contradiction.
The trivial topology on a space with more than one point is not Hausdorﬀ. A more interesting example of a non-Hausdorﬀ space is R with the topology having

Compactness

31

as its nonempty open sets the complements of ﬁnite sets, since in this topology any two nonempty open sets have a nonempty intersection. Many more examples of nonHausdorﬀ spaces can be constructed but they do not arise all that often ‘in nature’. Most non-Hausdorﬀ spaces are in one way or another artiﬁcial. It is probably not a great exaggeration to say that most interesting spaces are Hausdorﬀ.
Here are three nice properties of Hausdorﬀ spaces:
Proposition. (a) In a Hausdorﬀ space, points are closed subsets. (b) A subspace of a Hausdorﬀ space is Hausdorﬀ. (c) A product of two Hausdorﬀ spaces is Hausdorﬀ.

Proof. (a) If X is Hausdorﬀ and x is a point in X , then for any other point y there is

an open neighborhood Vy of y that is disjoint from a neighborhood of x and hence disjoint from x itself. The union of all these open sets Vy as y ranges over X − {x} is X − {x} , which is therefore open, so {x} is closed.

(b) Let A be a subspace of X and let x, y ∈ A . If X is Hausdorﬀ these two points

have disjoint open neighborhoods U and V in X , so A ∩ U and A ∩ V are disjoint

open neighborhoods of x and y in A .

(c) Suppose X and Y are Hausdorﬀ and we have two distinct points (x1, y1) and

(x2, y2) in X × Y , so either x1 = x2 or y1 = y2 . In the former case, if U1 and U2

are disjoint neighborhoods of x1 and x2 in X then U1 × Y and U2 × Y are disjoint

neighborhoods of (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in X × Y . The opposite case y1 = y2 is

handled similarly.

⊔⊓

Proposition. A compact subspace of a Hausdorﬀ space is closed.

Proof. Let X be Hausdorﬀ with A ⊂ X compact. The main work will be to show that for each x ∈ X − A there exist disjoint open sets U and V in X such that x ∈ U and A ⊂ V . This will imply that A is closed since no point x in the complement of A can be a limit point of A since it has a neighborhood U disjoint from A .
Now we construct U and V with the desired properties. The point x ∈ X − A and an arbitrary point a ∈ A have disjoint open neighborhoods Ux and Va in X since X is Hausdorﬀ. As a ranges over A the open sets Va form an open cover of A . Since A is compact, this open cover has a ﬁnite subcover. Call this subcover V1, ··· , Vn , and let the sets Ux that correspond to these Vi ’s be labelled U1, ··· , Un . The intersection U = U1 ∩ ··· ∩ Un is an open neighborhood of x that is disjoint from each Vi and hence also from the union V = V1 ∪ ··· ∪ Vn , which is an open set containing A . ⊔⊓
Corollary. A map f : X→Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorﬀ space Y is a
homeomorphism if it is continuous, one-to-one, and onto.
Proof. All that needs to be checked is that f −1 is continuous, and to do this it suﬃces to show that if C ⊂ X is closed in X then f (C) is closed in Y . But since C is a closed

32

Chapter 3

subset of a compact space, it is compact, hence f (C) is compact and therefore also

closed since Y is Hausdorﬀ.

⊔⊓

For example, consider continuous maps [0, 1]→[0, 1] × [0, 1] deﬁning paths in
the square. Intuition would suggest that no such map can be onto, but in fact this
intuition is incorrect, and there do exist continuous maps [0, 1]→[0, 1]×[0, 1] whose
image is the whole square. However, no such map can be one-to-one, otherwise the Corollary would say it is a homeomorphism, but [0, 1] and [0, 1] × [0, 1] are not homeomorphic since [0, 1] has cutpoints but [0, 1] × [0, 1] does not.
The Corollary implies that the topology on a space X that is both compact and Hausdorﬀ has a certain optimality property. Notice ﬁrst that any topology that is ﬁner than a Hausdorﬀ topology is still Hausdorﬀ, while a topology that is coarser than a compact topology is still compact.

If X is compact and Hausdorﬀ with respect to the topology O , then any other topology that is strictly ﬁner than O is Hausdorﬀ but not compact, while any other topology that is strictly coarser than O is compact but not Hausdorﬀ.
To see this, just apply the Corollary to the identity map X→X , which is continuous if
the topology in the domain is ﬁner than the topology in the range. If the topology in the domain is compact Hausdorﬀ and the topology in the range is strictly coarser, it would be compact but not Hausdorﬀ, otherwise the Corollary would imply the identity map was a homeomorphism so the two topologies would be the same. Similarly, if the topology in the range is compact Hausdorﬀ and the topology in the domain is strictly ﬁner, it would be Hausdorﬀ but not compact, otherwise the Corollary would say the identity map was a homeomorphism.

Normal Spaces
Often in a Hausdorﬀ space X there is a stronger form of the Hausdorﬀ condition that is satisﬁed: If A and B are disjoint closed sets in X , then there are disjoint open sets U and V in X with A ⊂ U and B ⊂ V . In short, disjoint closed sets have disjoint open neighborhoods. A Hausdorﬀ space with this property is called a normal space. We include the Hausdorﬀ condition as part of the deﬁnition of a normal space to guarantee that points are closed, so that the condition of disjoint closed sets having disjoint open neighborhoods includes the condition that distinct points have disjoint open neighborhoods. The reason for restricting A and B to be closed is that one would not expect arbitrary disjoint subsets to have disjoint open neighborhoods, since for example in R the sets {0} and (0, 1] do not have disjoint open neighborhoods.
In some cases the Hausdorﬀ condition automatically implies normality:
Proposition. A compact Hausdorﬀ space is normal.

Compactness

33

Proof. Let A and B be disjoint closed sets in a compact Hausdorﬀ space X . In partic-

ular this implies that A and B are compact since they are closed subsets of a compact

space. By the argument in the proof of the preceding Proposition we know that for

each x ∈ A there exist disjoint open sets Ux and Vx with x ∈ Ux and B ⊂ Vx . Letting

x vary over A , we have an open cover of A by the sets Ux , so there is a ﬁnite subcover.

Let U be the union of the sets Ux in this ﬁnite subcover and let V be the intersection

of the corresponding sets Vx . Then U and V are disjoint open neighborhoods of A

It is natural to ask whether all Hausdoﬀ spaces are normal, and here is an artiﬁcially constructed example to show that this need not be true:
Example. Let X be the subset of R2 consisting of all points (x, y) with y ≥ 0 . We construct a topology on X that is ﬁner than the usual topology in the following way. Let X′ ⊂ X be the complement of the x -axis, the points (x, y) with y > 0 . Then a basis for the new topology on X consists ﬁrst of all of the usual open disks Dr (x) of radius r and center x that are contained in X′ , and then in addition for each point x in the x -axis we take the sets Dr′ (x) = {x} ∪ (X′ ∩ Dr (x)) obtained by adding x to an open half-disk centered at x . It is easy to check that the condition for having a basis is satisﬁed, and we leave this for the reader to do. The Hausdorﬀ condition is also easily veriﬁed since any two distinct points of X are contained in disjoint basis sets. Notice that any subset of the x -axis is closed in this topology since its complement is open, being a union of basis sets. However, if we let A be the rational numbers in the x -axis and B the irrational numbers, then A and B are disjoint closed sets in X that do not have disjoint open neighborhoods, since any open set U containing A would contain basis sets Dr′ (a) for a ∈ A that intersect all the basis sets Ds′ (b) for b ∈ B with |a − b| < r , hence U would intersect any open set V containing B . Thus X is not normal.
Notice that the subspace topology on the x -axis is the discrete topology since the intersection of the open set Dr′ (x) with the x -axis is {x} , making {x} an open set in this subspace. On the other hand, the subspace topology on X′ , the complement of the x -axis, is the usual topology. So the topology on X somehow mingles these two rather diﬀerent sorts of topologies.

Proposition. Metric spaces are normal.

Before proving this we need a preliminary fact. Let X be a metric space with metric d . Given a subset A ⊂ X deﬁne the distance d(x, A) from a point x ∈ X to A to the the greatest lower bound of the set of distances d(x, a) from x to points a ∈ A . Note that d(x, A) ≥ 0 , and d(x, A) = 0 if and only if x is in the closure of A since d(x, A) = 0 is equivalent to saying that every ball Br (x) contains points of A .
Lemma. d(x, A) is a continuous function of x .

34

Chapter 3

Proof. Given ε > 0 , let x and y be points in X with d(x, y) < ε . For each δ > 0 there exists a ∈ A with d(x, a) < d(x, A) + δ . Then we have:

d(y, A) ≤ d(y, a) ≤ d(y, x) + d(x, a) < ε + δ + d(x, A)

Since this holds for each δ > 0 it follows that d(y, A) ≤ ε + d(x, A) . Rewriting

this as d(y, A) − d(x, A) ≤ ε , we can switch the roles of x and y to obtain also

d(x, A) − d(y, A) ≤ ε so |d(x, A) − d(y, A)| ≤ ε . This holds whenever d(x, y) < ε ,

from which we conclude that d(x, A) is a continuous function of x .

⊔⊓

Proof of the Proposition. If A and B are disjoint closed sets in the metric space X , we

claim that the sets U = { x | d(x, A) < d(x, B) } and V = { x | d(x, B) < d(x, A) } are

disjoint open neighborhoods of A and B , respectively. Certainly they are disjoint, and

they are open since for the diﬀerence function d(x, A) − d(x, B) , which is continuous

by the Lemma, U and V are the inverse images of the open sets (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞) .

To see that A ⊂ U note that d(x, A) = 0 for points x ∈ A and d(x, A) > 0 for points

x ∉ A since A is closed. Similarly we have B ⊂ V using the assumption that B is

closed.

Lebesgue Numbers
Given a cover of a metric space X by subsets Aα , a Lebesgue number for the cover is a number ε > 0 such that every ball Bε(x) in X is contained in at least one set Aα of the cover.
Theorem. Every open cover of a compact metric space X has a Lebesgue number.
For example, what would a Lebesgue number for the following open cover of a square be?

Compactness

35

Proof. Since X is compact, each open cover has a ﬁnite subcover, and there is no loss

of generality to ﬁnd a Lebesgue number for this subcover. Thus we may assume the

cover is by open sets U1, ··· , Un . For a ball Bε(x) to be contained in Ui is equivalent to the requirement that
d(x, X − Ui) ≥ ε . Thus we are led to consider the functions di(x) = d(x, X − Ui) , and to ask whether there exists an ε > 0 such that for each x ∈ X at least one of the

numbers d1(x), ··· , dn(x) is at least ε . Phrased diﬀerently, we are asking whether there is an ε > 0 such that the function f (x) = max{d1(x), ··· , dn(x)} satisﬁes f (x) ≥ ε for all x . Each function di(x) is continuous by the preceding Lemma, and we leave it as an exercise for the reader to verify that the maximum of a ﬁnite set

of continuous functions is again continuous. (By induction it suﬃces to do the case

of two functions.) So f is continuous. Since Ui is open, its complement X − Ui is closed and hence di(x) > 0 for all x ∈ Ui . Thus f (x) > 0 for all x ∈ X since the Ui ’s cover X . Since X is compact, the image f (X) is compact in (0, ∞) , so there is a lower bound ε > 0 for the values of f on X . By the remarks at the beginning of this

paragraph, this ε is a Lebesgue number for the cover.

⊔⊓

Corollary. Let f : X→Y be a continuous map from a compact metric space X to a
metric space Y . Then f is uniformly continuous: For each ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that d(f (x), f (x′)) < ε for all x, x′ ∈ X with d(x, x′) < δ .

Proof. Given ε > 0 , cover X by the open sets f −1(Bε/2(y)) as y ranges over Y . Let

δ be a Lebesgue number for this cover of X . Then f takes each ball Bδ(x) to some ball Bε/2(y) , so if d(x, x′) < δ then d(f (x), f (x′)) ≤ d(f (x), y) + d(y, f (x′)) <

ε/2 + ε/2 = ε .

Inﬁnite Products
There are times when one is interested in the product X1 × X2 × ··· of an inﬁnite sequence of spaces X1, X2, ··· . As a set, this product consists of all sequences (x1, x2, ···) with xi ∈ Xi for each i . We will also use the notation i Xi for this product. As an example, the Cantor set can be viewed as the product i Xi where each Xi is the set {0, 2} by identifying an inﬁnite base 3 decimal .a1a2 ··· with the sequence (a1, a2, ···) .
A ﬁrst guess for how to deﬁne a topology on an inﬁnite product i Xi would be to do the same thing as for ﬁnite products, taking as a basis the products U1 ×U2 ×··· of open sets Ui ⊂ Xi . The same argument as for ﬁnite products shows that this does in fact deﬁne a topology, called the box topology on i Xi . However, if one tries to work with this topology, one ﬁnds it has some undesirable features. For example,
many maps Z→ i Xi that one would expect to be continuous are not continuous if

36

Chapter 3

the box topology is used on the inﬁnite product. To take a concrete instance, if Z and
each Xi is R then the harmless-looking map x ֏ (x, x, ···) fails to be continuous,
since the inverse image of the product (−1/2, 1/2) × (−1/3, 1/3) × (−1/4, 1/4) × ···
is just {0} , which is not open.
Fortunately there is another topology on inﬁnite products that avoids defects
like this. Instead of taking a basis to consist of all products U1 × U2 × ··· of open sets Ui ⊂ Xi , one only takes products for which Ui = Xi for all but ﬁnitely many
values of i . This guarantees that a map f : Z→ i Xi , f (z) = (f1(z), f2(z), ···) , is
continuous if and only if each fi is continuous, since we have f −1(U1 × U2 × ···) = f1−1(U1) ∩ f2−1(U2) ∩ ··· , and this will be open if each fi is continuous, as it is really only a ﬁnite intersection since fi−1(Ui) = fi−1(Xi) = Z for all but ﬁnitely many values of i .
This topology on i Xi is called the product topology since it turns out to be the one that is used for inﬁnite products almost all the time. Notice that for ﬁnite
products it gives the same thing as the product topology deﬁned earlier.

Example. The Cantor set is homeomorphic to the product {0, 2} × {0, 2} × ··· where each {0, 2} is given the discrete topology. [Proof: Use the basis for the topology on the Cantor set given by the sets O(a1, ··· , an) consisting of all decimals whose ﬁrst n digits are a1, ··· , an and whose remaining digits are arbitrary.]
Another advantage of the product topology over the box topology is that it preserves compactness:

Theorem. An inﬁnite product

∞ i=1

Xi

with

the

product

topology

is

compact

if

each

Xi

is compact.

This would not be true for the box topology. For example, if each Xi is a ﬁnite set having at least two elements, with the discrete topology, then the box topology on the inﬁnite product is the discrete topology, which is never compact for an inﬁnite set.

Proof. We will argue by contradiction. Suppose there is an open cover O of i Xi that
has no ﬁnite subcover. Assuming this, we claim ﬁrst that there exists a point x1 ∈ X1 such that no basis set U1 × X2 × X3 × ··· with x1 ∈ U1 is covered by ﬁnitely many sets
in O . For otherwise if for every x1 there was a basis set U1 × X2 × X3 × ··· covered by ﬁnitely many sets in O , with x1 ∈ U1 , then the collection of all these U1 ’s as x1 varied
over X1 would be an open cover of X1 , so since X1 is compact this cover would have
a ﬁnite subcover, and it would follow that the cover O had a ﬁnite subcover, contrary
to assumption.
Having chosen the point x1 , we claim next that there is a point x2 ∈ X2 such that no basis set U1 × U2 × X3 × ··· with (x1, x2) ∈ U1 × U2 is covered by ﬁnitely many sets
in O. For otherwise if for every x2 there was such a basis set U1 × U2 × X3 × ··· , then
the collection of these U2 ’s as x2 varied over X2 would be an open cover of X2 , and compactness of X2 would give a ﬁnite subcover. Letting U1′ be the intersection of the

Compactness

37

corresponding ﬁnite set of U1 ’s, we would then have a basis set U1′ × X2 × X3 × ···
covered by ﬁnitely many sets in O , with x1 ∈ U1′ , contrary to how x1 was chosen in
the preceding paragraph.

Repeating this same argument, we can choose an inﬁnite sequence of points xi ∈

Xi for i = 1, 2, ··· , such that for each n , no basis set U1 × ··· × Un × Xn+1 × ···

with (x1, ··· , xn) ∈ U1 × ··· × Un is covered by ﬁnitely many sets in O . But this is

impossible because the point (x1, x2, ···) has to lie in some set in O and since this

set is open, it will contain a basis set U1 × ··· × Un × Xn × ··· containing (x1, x2, ···) ,

so in particular this basis set will be covered by a single set in O .

⊔⊓

We have considered the product of a countable collections of spaces Xn but it is also possible to deﬁne the product of an arbitrary inﬁnite collection of spaces Xα where α ranges over any index set I . If I is uncountable we cannot write elements
of the product α Xα as sequences (x1, x2, ···) . Instead, elements of α Xα are
regarded as functions α ֏ xα ∈ Xα , assigning an element of Xα to each index α , just as sequences (x1, x2, ···) can be viewed as functions i ֏ xi ∈ Xi . One can
write an element of α Xα brieﬂy as (xα) , it being understood that this is not just a single xα but a family of them parametrized by α ∈ I . As in the case of countable products, the product topology on α Xα has as basis the products α Uα of open sets Uα ⊂ Xα such that Ua = Xα for all but ﬁnitely many values of α . It is again a theorem that α Xα is compact if each Xα is compact, but the proof requires a fancier form of induction that depends on a preliminary discussion of set theory topics called
the ‘well-ordering principle’ and the ‘axiom of choice’, so we will not go into this here.

Chapter 4

Chapter 4. Quotient Spaces
Our next objective is to describe a general procedure for building complicated spaces out of simpler spaces. This is the topological analog of how all sorts of objects are made in the real world. Just think of all the diﬀerent words there are in the English language for putting things together: gluing, pasting, taping, stapling, stitching, sewing, welding, riveting, soldering, brazing, bonding, nailing, bolting, clamping, ...
To take two simple examples, we can construct either a cylinder or a M¨obius band by taking a rectangular strip and gluing two opposite edges together:

The gluing process can be described as a map f : X→Y where X is the rectangle and
Y is either the cylinder or the M¨obius band. The map f is onto, but not quite oneto-one because of the gluing: Two points on opposite edges of the rectangle that are glued together have the same image under f , but other than this, f is one-to-one.
Is it possible to describe the topology on Y just in terms of the topology on X and the map f ? If so, then we can construct the space Y just by saying “start with the space X and glue this to that", since the gluing instructions are telling what the set Y and the map f are. In many cases there is an easy way to characterize open sets in Y in terms of open sets in X :
Proposition. If f : X→Y is continuous and onto, with X compact and Y Hausdorﬀ,
then a set U ⊂ Y is open in Y if and only if f −1(U) is open in X .

Proof. Continuity of f says that f −1(U) is open if U is open, so we need to see that the converse is true if X is compact and Y is Hausdorﬀ. If f −1(U) is open in X then X−f −1(U) is closed and hence compact since X is compact. The image f (X−f −1(U))

is then compact in Y , and therefore also closed since Y is Hausdorﬀ. But since f is

onto we have f (X − f −1(U)) = Y − U . Thus Y − U is closed, so U is open.

⊔⊓

This Proposition applies to the cylinder and M¨obius band examples. One’s ﬁrst guess might have been that the open sets in Y are the images f (O) of open sets O in X . However, this isn’t right because an open neighborhood of a point x on the left or right edge of the rectangle is sent to a set in Y that is not an open neighborhood

Quotient Spaces

41

of f (x) , but only ‘half’ of an actual open neighborhood U of f (x) . To get the other
half of U one would have to enlarge the open set O in X to include also an open neighborhood of the other point x′ with f (x′) = f (x) . This amounts to replacing O by f −1(U) , as stated in the Proposition.

The Quotient Topology
For a map f : X→Y the previous Proposition gives conditions under which the
topology on Y can be characterized in terms of the topology on X . It is also possible to make this characterization into a deﬁnition of a topology on Y , as the following shows:
Proposition. Given a space X , a set Y , and a function f : X→Y , then the collection of
all sets U ⊂ Y such that f −1(U) is open in X is a topology on Y .

Proof. The axioms for unions and intersections are satisﬁed since f −1( α Uα) =

α f −1(Uα) and f −1( α Uα) = α f −1(Uα) . For the other two axioms we have

f −1(∅) = ∅ and f −1(Y ) = X .

⊔⊓

Notice that we did not require f to be onto in this Proposition. If f is not onto then points y ∈ Y − f (X) form open sets {y} since their inverse images f −1(y) are empty and hence open. So these points are just isolated points of Y having nothing to do with the topology on f (X) . Assuming f is onto is thus not a very serious restriction.
Deﬁnition. If the map f : X→Y is onto, the topology on Y given by this Proposition
is called the quotient topology on Y , and the map f is called a quotient map. One also says that Y is a quotient space of X .
In these terms, the earlier Proposition then says that any continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorﬀ space that is onto is a quotient map.
In the examples of the torus and M¨obius band as quotient spaces of a rectangle we already had existing models of the quotient space, but sometimes one wants to construct a quotient space without having a model of it available beforehand. One would just like to start with a space X and say “glue this to that" and know that these instructions will automatically produce a quotient space of X . To see that this is
always possible, suppose ﬁrst that we do have a quotient map f : X→Y . The points
of X that are ‘glued together’ to produce a point y ∈ Y are exactly the points in

42

Chapter 4

f −1(y) . Since quotient maps are onto, f −1(y) is always nonempty. Thus the points y ∈ Y are in one-to-one correspondence with the subsets f −1(y) of X . These subsets are disjoint for diﬀerent choices of y , and their union is all of X since each point of X is sent by f to some point of Y . Thus the sets f −1(y) form a partition of X into disjoint subsets. For example, for the cylinder and M¨obius band these subsets of the rectangle each have either one or two points — either a pair of points on the left and right edges of the rectangle or a single point not on either of these edges.
Conversely, suppose we are given a partition of X into disjoint nonempty subsets. For x ∈ X we denote the set in the partition containing x by [x] . If we simply deﬁne
Y to be the set of all these subsets [x] , then we have a natural function f : X→Y
sending x to [x] , and this f is onto so we can use it to deﬁne a topology on Y by specifying that a set U ⊂ Y is open exactly when f −1(U) is open in X . This makes f into a quotient map. We will use the notation X/ ∼ for this quotient space Y whose points are the sets [x] in the partition of X . Here ∼ is the relation on X given by x ∼ x′ if [x] = [x′] , i.e., x and x′ lie in the same set in the partition of X . This is an equivalence relation, meaning that it satisﬁes the three properties
(i) x ∼ x for all x ∈ X . (ii) If x ∼ y then y ∼ x . (iii) If x ∼ y and y ∼ z then x ∼ z .
Conversely, every equivalence relation on X determines a partition of X into the equivalence classes [x] = { x′ ∈ X | x′ ∼ x } .
In practice the partition of X is often speciﬁed implicitly by saying which points we wish to glue together, or in other words, which points of X we wish to become identiﬁed to single points in Y . For example, to obtain the cylinder from the rectangle [0, 1] × [0, 1] we make the identiﬁcations (0, t) ∼ (1, t) for t ∈ [0, 1] , and to obtain the M¨obius band we instead identify (0, t) ∼ (1, 1 − t) . If identiﬁcations in a space X are speciﬁed by means of a relation ∼ then this determines a quotient space X/ ∼ associated to the partition of X into the smallest subsets that contain all the speciﬁed pairs x ∼ x′ . In particular, if no identiﬁcations are speciﬁed for a point x ∈ X then x becomes a set [x] = {x} of the partition all by itself.
Example. The torus S1 × S1 can be realized as a quotient space of a rectangle [0, 1] × [0, 1] by identifying both pairs of opposite edges via (0, t) ∼ (1, t) and (s, 0) ∼ (s, 1) .

If we ﬁrst identify the top and bottom edges of the rectangle we obtain a cylinder,

Quotient Spaces

43

and then identifying the two ends of the cylinder produces a torus. Notice that the identiﬁcations of opposite edges of the rectangle force all four corners to be identiﬁed to a single point. In particular, we are making the identiﬁcation (0, 0) ∼ (1, 1) even though this is not part of either of the original identiﬁcations (0, t) ∼ (1, t) and (s, 0) ∼ (s, 1) , but follows since (0, 0) ∼ (0, 1) ∼ (1, 1) .
Given a concrete quotient map f : X→Y we can also form the abstract quotient
space X/ ∼ associated to the partition of X into the subsets f −1(y) , and it would be nice to know that this is really the same as Y . The map f induces a well-deﬁned
function f : X/ ∼ →Y sending f −1(y) to y , and this f is obviously one-to-one and
onto.
Proposition. This function f : X/ ∼ →Y is a homeomorphism.

Proof. Let p : X→X/ ∼ be the quotient map x ֏ [x] = { x′ ∈ X | f (x′) = f (x) } , so

f = f p . Then a set U ⊂ Y is open if and only if f −1(U) is open (since f is a quotient

map), but since f −1(U) = p−1(f −1(U)) and p is a quotient map, this is equivalent to

f −1(U) being open.

⊔⊓

Example. Let us describe three ways to obtain the sphere S2 as a quotient space. First, as shown in the ﬁgure below, we can form S2 from two closed disks by identifying their boundary circles together to form a single circle, the equator of S2 . The two disks then become the upper and lower hemispheres of S2 . More formally, we can take the two disks as the space X = D2 × {−1, 1} ⊂ R2 × R = R3 , where D2 is the closed unit disk in R2 , and then the identiﬁcations are (x, 1) ∼ (x, −1) for x ∈ ∂D2 ,
with the map X→S2 given by vertical projection of each disk onto the hemisphere it
is tangent to.

A second way to realize S2 as a quotient space is to start with a single closed disk D2 and glue the top half of its boundary circle to the bottom half, each point in the upper half being identiﬁed with the point directly below it in the lower half, as in the next ﬁgure.

44

Chapter 4

Parallel vertical lines in the disk then become parallel vertical circles in S2 . It would
not be diﬃcult to write down a formula for an explicit quotient map D2→S2 that
does this, although there is really no need for explicit formulas. The third construction also realizes S2 as a quotient of D2 , but this time all the
points of ∂D2 are identiﬁed to a single point of S2 , the south pole. This is achieved
by a map D2→S2 that sends each radial line segment to a meridian of S2 going from
the north pole to the south pole. We can view this as taking a disk tangent to the sphere and wrapping it completely around the sphere, as in the following ﬁgure:
This example diﬀers from all the previous ones in that the map f : X→Y is no longer
ﬁnite-to-one. In the next example we will not have a ready-made model of the quotient space,
so we will be constructing a new space as a quotient of a known space. Example. Let us construct a surface, commonly called the Klein bottle, by modifying the earlier construction of the torus from a rectangle by reversing the orientation of one of the edges of the rectangle:
By deﬁnition, the Klein bottle is the quotient space of the rectangle obtained by identifying opposite edges according to the orientations shown. We will use the notation K2 for this space, the superscript indicating that it is a 2 -dimensional surface. Identify-

Quotient Spaces

45

ing the top and bottom edges of the rectangle gives a cylinder, but to identify the two ends of the cylinder by deforming the cylinder in R3 requires that the cylinder pass
through itself in order to make the orientations match, as in the third ﬁgure. Thus we have a map from K2 into R3 which is not one-to-one because two circles in K2 have the same image circle C in R3 . In fact, it is a theorem that there is no embedding of K2 into R3 , i.e., there is no subspace of R3 homeomorphic to K2 . However, there is an embedding into R4 . The ﬁrst three coordinates of this embedding are the map
K2→R3 indicated in the ﬁgure. For the fourth coordinate we just need a map f : K2→R that takes diﬀerent values on the
two circles C1 and C2 of K2 that map to C . In the rectangle these two circles are positioned as in the ﬁgure at the right. We can choose f to have a value ε > 0 on C1 and be 0 everywhere outside a small neighborhood of C1 . Example. Let P 2 be the set of all lines through the origin in R3 . This is a metric space
if we deﬁne the ‘distance’ between two lines through the ori-
gin to be the smaller of the two angles between them, so this
angle lies in the interval [0, π /2] . The ﬁrst two properties
required of a metric are obviously satisﬁed, and we will leave
it for the reader to check the triangle inequality. There is a
natural map p : S2→P 2 sending a point x ∈ S2 to the line through the origin con-
taining x . Each line through the origin intersects S2 in two antipodal points x and −x , so p is onto and is exactly two-to-one. We can see that p is continuous since p−1 of an ε -ball in P 2 consists of two antipodal ε -balls in S2 . It follows that p is
a quotient map since it is a continuous map from a compact space onto a Hausdorﬀ space (metric spaces are Hausdorﬀ). This means that we can regard P 2 as the quotient space of S2 in which each point x is identiﬁed with the antipodal point −x , so P 2 = S2/(x ∼ −x) .
The classical name for P 2 is the projective plane. This comes from thinking of
how 2 -dimensional pictures (drawings or paintings, for example) of 3 -dimensional
objects are obtained. Each point of a 3 -dimensional object projects onto the plane
of the picture along the line from the point to the viewer’s eye. The points that we
see are then really just all the diﬀerent lines converging to our eye. Normally one’s
angle of vision is something less than 180 degrees, and a picture encompasses con-
siderably less than 180 degrees. But imagine what might happen if we could see more
than 180 degrees at a time. Two points in space that were exactly 180 degrees apart
would presumably be recognized as distinct points. So perhaps if we were making
a mathematical model of how we see things we should not identify antipodal points of S2 but just consider S2 itself. This leads to a kind of geometry called spherical
geometry. The other alternative of identifying antipodal points leads to a slightly dif-
ferent geometry called projective geometry, which is in some ways closer to Euclidean

Chapter 4

geometry, and therefore preferable for some purposes.
Each line through the origin in R3 intersects the upper hemisphere of S2 in either one or two points, the latter possibility holding only for lines in the xy -plane. This means that we can also describe P 2 as the quotient space of the upper hemisphere
obtained by identifying antipodal points in its boundary, the equator. Since the upper
hemisphere is homeomorphic to a disk via vertical projection onto the unit disk in the xy -plane, this means that P 2 is describable as the quotient space of the disk D2 with the identiﬁcations x ∼ −x for x ∈ ∂D2 .
As with the Klein bottle, it is impossible to embed P 2 as a subspace of R3 , so one
looks instead for a map P → 2 R3 that is almost an embedding. We will describe a map
that is an embedding on the interior of D2 and folds the circle ∂D2/(x ∼ −x) onto a
line segment. The image of this map is shown in the ﬁgure on the right below:

To describe the construction in words, we ﬁrst deform the D2 in the ﬁgure on the left
so that it becomes a sphere with a slit. The boundary circle of the slit is divided into
four arcs and we would like to identify these four arcs in pairs, a with a and b with b
according to the orientations shown. Identifying the ﬁrst pair presents no problems, but to identify the second pair then forces all four arcs to coincide in R3 , so that one
has a sphere pinched along a line segment as the image of the map P → 2 R3 . The
preimage of the interior of this line segment consists of two distinct open arcs in P 2 .
The upper half of the third ﬁgure is known as a crosscap. It is the image of a map of a M¨obius band to R3 , the M¨obius band obtained by removing an open disk from P 2 . Thinking of P 2 as D2 with antipodal boundary points identiﬁed, the M¨obius band is obtained by removing a smaller concentric disk from D2 , leaving an annulus, with antipodal points on one of its boundary circles identiﬁed. Thinking of P 2 as S2/(x ∼ −x) , one ﬁrst removes symmetric disk neighborhoods of the two poles of S2
leaving an equatorial band, and then one identiﬁes antipodal points in this band to
produce a M¨obius band.
This example of the projective plane easily generalizes to higher dimensions. The n -dimensional projective space P n is the space of lines through the origin in Rn+1 , the quotient space Sn/(x ∼ −x) , or equivalently the quotient of Dn with antipodal points of ∂Dn identiﬁed. When n = 1 this is just identifying the endpoints of a

semicircle, so P 1 is homeomorphic to S1 .
It can easily happen that a quotient space of a Hausdorﬀ space is non-Hausdorﬀ. Here is a simple example:
Example. Let X = R × {0, 1} , two disjoint copies of R , and make the identiﬁcations (x, 0) ∼ (x, 1) for all x > 0 . Then the two points x0 = (0, 0) and x1 = (0, 1) are distinct in the quotient although any two neighborhoods U0 of x0 and U1 of x1 in the quotient intersect since they contain points (x, 0) ∼ (x, 1) for x > 0 . Quotient maps are not generally open maps, taking open sets to open sets, but this happens to be the case in this example.
If we make a small modiﬁcation of this example by setting (x, 0) ∼ (x, 1) for x ≥ 0 rather than x > 0 then the quotient becomes Hausdorﬀ, three lines in R2 meeting at a point.
Here is a technical result that is used quite often when proving things about quotient spaces:
Lemma. Given a quotient map f : X→Y and a space Z , then a function g : Y →Z is continuous if and only if the composition gf : X→Z is continuous.

Proof. Let O ⊂ Z be open. Then by the deﬁnition of a quotient map, the set g−1(O) is open in Y if and only if f −1(g−1(O)) = (gf )−1(O) is open in X . This is saying

that g is continuous if and only if gf is continuous.

Surfaces
In this section we ﬁnally get to make a detailed study of a particular class of spaces that are important in several branches of mathematics, surfaces. Our point of view is purely topological, so some of the more reﬁned structural questions about surfaces that are studied in these other branches of mathematics, such as analytic structure and metric properties like curvature, are ignored here. It is just the basic topology that we are interested in.
Deﬁnition. A surface is a Hausdorﬀ space X such that each point x ∈ X has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to R2 , or equivalently, an open disk in R2 .
Certainly R2 itself is a surface by this deﬁnition, or any open set in R2 . A compact example is S2 , since every open hemisphere in S2 , the region on one side of a plane in R3 through the center of the sphere, is homeomorphic to an open disk. Another compact example is the torus S1 × S1 . The projective plane and the Klein bottle are two more examples. For the projective plane one can obtain open neighborhoods

Chapter 4

homeomorphic to a disk by taking the images of open hemispheres in S2 under the
natural quotient map S2→P 2 .
The torus is the ﬁrst in an inﬁnite sequence of compact surfaces, the n -holed
tori. Here is a picture for n = 3 :

More generally one can deﬁne an n -dimensional manifold to be a Hausdorﬀ space in which each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to Rn . The Hausdorﬀ condition is included to exclude strange spaces that would otherwise have to be considered as manifolds too. For example, when n = 1 the quotient space of R × {0, 1} obtained by identifying (x, 0) with (x, 1) for all x > 0 has the property that each point of the quotient has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R .
In a manifold every point has a path-connected neighborhood, so by a Proposition in Chapter 2 we know that path-components are the same as connected components, and these components are open sets. So each component is itself a manifold that is connected. A compact manifold can have only ﬁnitely many components since the diﬀerent components form an open cover of the manifold.
We will focus mainly on compact surfaces in this chapter, with the goal of obtaining a complete list of all of them. Before starting on this, however, let us digress to derive the analogous but simpler result for 1 -dimensional manifolds:
Theorem. A compact connected 1 -dimensional manifold is homeomorphic to S1 .
Proof. Let X be a compact connected 1 -dimensional manifold. Compactness implies that there is a ﬁnite cover of X by open subsets U1, ··· , Un homeomorphic to open intervals. We must have n ≥ 2 since a single open interval is not compact. We may assume there are no inclusions Ui ⊂ Uj for i = j . Since X is connected there must exist two of these sets Ui and Uj that intersect. By examining how Ui and Uj can intersect we will show that either (a) Ui ∪ Uj is homeomorphic to S1 or (b) Ui ∪ Uj is homeomorphic to an open interval. In the latter case we can replace Ui and Uj by this open interval to produce an open cover with fewer sets, so by induction this will leave only case (a) to consider. In case (a) the subset Ui ∪ Uj of X is open since it is a union of two open sets, and it is closed since it is a compact subspace of a Hausdorﬀ space, being homeomorphic to S1 . So if X is connected we would have X = Ui ∪ Uj homeomorphic to S1 , ﬁnishing the proof.
It remains to show that if Ui ∩ Uj is nonempty then Ui ∪ Uj is homeomorphic to either S1 or an open interval. We know that Ui ∩ Uj is open in X and hence in Ui which is homeomorphic to an open interval, so Ui ∩ Uj is a union of disjoint open

intervals in Ui . Let A be one of these intervals. Then A is an open connected set in Uj , so since Uj is homeomorphic to an open interval, A is also an open interval in Uj . We claim that A must be an end interval of Ui , or in other words, if we choose a homeomorphism between Ui and an interval (a, b) then this homeomorphism takes A to an interval (a, c) or (c, b) . For suppose A corresponds to an interval (c, d) with

a < c < d < b . We know that A is not all of Uj since Uj is not contained in Ui , so this means that at one end of A there are distinct points xi ∈ Ui and xj ∈ Uj . However, this violates the Hausdorﬀ property of X since every neighborhood of xi meets every neighborhood of xj in points in A . This contradiction shows that A must be an end interval of Ui , and the same reasoning shows that it must also be an end interval of Uj . Moreover, at one end of A we must have a point of Ui and at the other end a point of Uj , otherwise the Hausdorﬀ property would again be violated. Since Ui and Uj each have only two ends, this means that Uj ∩ Uj can consist of at most two intervals. If there are two intervals we have option (a) and if there is only one interval we have

option (b).

⊔⊓

By pushing this reasoning a little farther it would not be hard to show that a noncompact connected 1 -dimensional manifold that is the union of a countable collection of open sets homeomorphic to R must be homeomorphic to R itself. (The option (b) cannot occur, so it follows that the manifold can be expressed as the union of an increasing sequence of open intervals U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ ··· , which implies that the manifold must be homeomorphic to R .) One may ask whether there are noncompact connected 1 -dimensional manifolds that are not the union of a countable collection of open sets homeomorphic to R . The answer is that there are, but these Frankensteinian monsters exist only in laboratories, not in nature.

Our aim is to provide an explicit list of all compact connected surfaces, at least for the surfaces that can be built from a ﬁnite collection of disjoint polygons by identifying pairs of edges. We call such surfaces polygonal. It is in fact true that all compact surfaces are homeomorphic to polygonal surfaces, although we will not prove this here.
The list of surfaces will contain the sphere S2 , the n -hole torus which will write as nT 2 , and a sequence of surfaces nP 2 generalizing the projective plane P 2 . To construct nP 2 start with the sphere S2 , then remove the interiors of n disjoint closed disks in S2 and attach a cross-cap to the boundary circle of each of the resulting holes by forming a quotient space in which the boundary circle of each cross-cap is identiﬁed with a boundary circle of a hole:

50

Chapter 4

When n = 1 this gives P 2 . Since P 2 can also be obtained from a disk D2 by identifying antipodal pairs of points in its boundary, a cross-cap can be obtained from an annulus S1 × [0, 1] by identifying antipodal pairs of points in one of its boundary circles. It follows that nP 2 could also be obtained by taking a sphere, removing the interiors of n disjoint closed disks, then identifying pairs of antipodal points on each of the resulting boundary circles.
Theorem. Every compact connected polygonal surface is homeomorphic to either the sphere S2 , an n -hole torus nT 2 , or a sphere with n crosscaps nP 2 .
One might wonder where the Klein bottle K2 is in this list. As we will see, K2 is homeomorphic to 2P 2 .
Proof. Let S be a polygonal surface, obtained by identifying pairs of edges of some ﬁnite set of polygons. If there are two or more polygons and S is connected, there must be a pair of edges in two diﬀerent polygons that are identiﬁed. If we identify these two edges, the two polygons become a single polygon, reducing the the total number of polygons needed to construct S . After repeating this reduction a ﬁnite number of times we may assume S is obtained by identifying the edges of a single polygon.
The plan of the proof is to identify one pair of edges at a time and to see inductively what the resulting surface becomes after each such identiﬁcation. What we will show by induction is that at each stage the surface is homeomorphic to one of a family of standard models which we call ‘spheres with handles, cross-handles, cross-caps, and holes’. To construct one of these standard models, we start with a sphere with the interiors of a ﬁnite set of disjoint closed disks removed. These will be taken to be round disks bounded by actual circles and to lie all in a row on the sphere. After the interiors of the disks are removed we have a sphere with holes. We allow cross-caps to be attached to some of the holes, and we allow cylinders to be attached to certain pairs of adjacent holes. There are two essentially diﬀerent ways to attach such a cylinder, depending on choices of orientations. These are shown in the following ﬁgure:

Quotient Spaces

51

In the ﬁrst case we say we are attaching a handle, and in the second case we say we are attaching a cross-handle. Just as attaching a cross-cap is equivalent to identifying pairs of antipodal points in the boundary of a hole, attaching a handle or cross-handle is equivalent to identifying the boundary circles of two holes.
After we have shown that the given surface S is homeomorphic to one of the standard models, the rest of the proof will consist of showing:
(A) Attaching a cross-handle is equivalent to attaching two cross-caps, i.e., the two surfaces obtained by attaching a cross-handle or a pair of cross-caps are homemorphic.
(B) If there is at least one cross-cap already present, then attaching a handle is equivalent to attaching a cross-handle.
By applying (A) repeatedly we can replace all cross-handles by cross-caps, so we may assume S is a sphere with some number (perhaps zero) of handles and some number (perhaps zero) of cross-caps attached. Then if there is at least one cross-cap we can apply (B) to eliminate all handles, ﬁrst replacing them by cross-handles and then by pairs of cross-caps using (A). The result will be that we have either a sphere, a sphere with handles, or a sphere with cross-caps, as stated in the Theorem.
