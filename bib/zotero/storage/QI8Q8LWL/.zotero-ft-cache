Minimum-Time Path Planning for Autonomous Landing of UAV on Aerial Drone Carrier
Morteza Alijani1 and Anas Osman2

Abstract—The motivation for this work stems from the need to develop trajectory planning algorithms for small UAVs with limited resources. The goal is to address one of the most critical problems in UAV design, namely weight constraints. Therefore, in order to reduce the weight, small batteries are used which affect the ﬂight duration and overall performance. To increase the operating time during a mission, frequent recharging is typically required. To solve this problem, an autonomous airto-air take-off and landing on a drone carrier for recharging is proposed. The main objective of this study is to calculate the minimum time and thus the shortest maneuver route between the UAV and the drone carrier. To achieve this goal, the path planning algorithm is utilized through the closed-loop direct optimal control approach to calculate the optimal time, which is deﬁned as a cost function. In addition to the optimization techniques, the singular perturbation technique (SPT) and the Hamiltonian are used to solve and reﬁne the optimal control problem (OCP). Finally, the numerical simulation results in both open and closed loop are presented and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, technology has made an impressive leap in development and innovation, which has led to a noticeable demand for new technologies, especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The UAV is an aircraft that can be ﬂown autonomously or remotely from the ground without a pilot on board. Over the past few years, UAVs have gained increasing popularity in both civil and military operations. UAVs are thriving in practical applications such as wildlife monitoring [1], disease control [2], search and rescue [3], delivery services at Amazon and Google in the US [4,5], DHL-Postdienst in Germany [6], Smart Dust [7] and military services [8]. Nevertheless, the implementation of the system with UAVs is limited by battery power in terms of capacity and ﬂight time. During search and rescue missions, for example, these small UAVs are exposed to considerable risk due to battery constraints, resulting in frequent downtimes for recharging. One of the latest techniques proposed by researchers to tackle this issue is autonomous take-off and landing on a mobile platform that can be used for recharging [9]. In this scenario, the operation is performed automatically without human intervention. The primary goal of this approach is to ensure continuous operation and an extension of the ﬂight

time of the UAV without any disturbances. This technique has already been applied in many cases, such as autonomous take-off and landing on a moving aircraft carrier [10] and vessels [11]. Moreover, studies have recently been carried out that include the implementation of a free autonomous landing system Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which allows the UAVs to land safely on a mobile platform [12], [13]. Vision-based autonomous landing techniques also suggest a target tracking system that can land on a moving platform [9]. The same is true for air-to-air refueling, which has achieved an extraordinary degree of research popularity, especially through the continuous connection of Air-to-Air Autonomous Refueling (AAAR) with the military sector. Airto-air refueling has proven to be effective in extending ﬂight range and endurance [13]. On the other hand, one of the main challenges for intelligent UAV development is path planing [14]. Taking to account the battery limitations on the UAV, it is necessary to identify the shortest route for manoeuvres of UAVs, since the power consumed during manoeuvres is closely linked to the length of the ﬂight path. The motivation behind path planning methods in UAVs is not only to ﬁnd an optimal solution but also to provide UAVs with a collision-free orbit. Typically, the process of extracting the optimal path and the corresponding optimal control signal is divided into two main categories, namely open-loop and closed-loop optimization, since many different algorithms have been developed for each technique. Closedloop optimization itself can be divided into linear and nonlinear optimization, depending on the nature of the dynamics of the system subject to the optimization process. For example, in [15], the authors use the nonlinear model predictive control approach based on a geometric representation of the error to track the posture of the multirotor Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) based on the SO(3) special orthogonal group. Recently, some closed-loop nonlinear optimization algorithms have also been developed, which introduce full feedback nonlinear model prediction control that combines trajectory optimization and tracking control into a single uniﬁed approach. The Sequential Linear Quadratic used in a Model Predictive Control (SLQMPC) to solve a nonlinear optimal control problem and perform an experiment with the full system dynamics of the MAV [16]. Although the closed-loop system can be robustly controlled against external disturbances, the optimization is dynamically unacceptable because the optimization process can only be applied to the error part of the UAV dynamics, while in the case of open-loop optimization, more effective optimization can be realized since the optimization is performed for the main dynamics of the system [16,17].

Moreover, the identiﬁcation of the optimal path of a system can be explained as an optimal control problem for which two main algorithms can be used, including direct and indirect methods. In the direct approach, the parameters involved in the dynamics of the UAV are optimized to obtain an optimal cost function. In indirect methods, on the other hand, the optimization algorithm has to compute variations, which leads to a two-boundary value problem. The indirect method is usually associated with nonlinear systems with complex dynamics, since they can beneﬁt from the analytical capabilities of the indirect approach. The direct method, however, is a numerical method that considers only linear systems that can be directly optimized [17]. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a direct closed-loop optimization method, which is a numerical method for determining the optimal path and the associated optimal control of the UAV. The proposed optimization method is a Hamiltonian method based on a numerical approach. The reason for choosing this technique is that there is no speciﬁc algorithm that can deﬁne an optimal path for the UAVs. Therefore, due to the linear model and experimental setup, we choose numerical methods since an exact model of the system is not available and path planning can be performed ofﬂine in our proposed algorithm [17]. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. We have presented the dynamic model of the UAV in Section II. The optimal control solution using Hamilton’s principle and singular perturbation technique is described in detail in Section III. The numerical simulation, results and conclusion are discussed in Section IV and Section V, respectively.
II. DYNAMICAL MODEL
In this section we demonstrate the dynamic system of the UAV with forces in detail. We use the simpliﬁed model of the UAV to obtain a feasible closed-loop solution. The formulation of the problem is done through the construction of the dynamic model illustrated in Figure 1. In this study, the spatial coordinate system of the UAV and aerial platform has been established in the (2D) X-Y axis demonstrated in Figure 2. The X-axis and the Y-axis are in the same vertical plane, X-axis is perpendicular to the Y-axis. The UAV and aerial (Drone) carrier have the same direction and positive in X-axis. The equations describing the motion of the UAV in the vertical plane are presented in (1) to (7) [18]. By considering the Figure 1, in these formulas, point u represents the position of the UAV and point d depicts the position of the Drone carrier, while vector vu and vd illustrates the velocity of UAV and drone carrier, respectively. (xu, yu) and (xd, yd) are respectively the positions of the UAV and Carrier, Mu is the total mass of the UAV, ✓u represents the interceptor’s heading angle (the UAV), TF is the total thrust force of the UAV produced by 4-rotors, DF , and FL are the total drag force and total lift force that affect the UAV, accordingly. Finally, ↵ is the angle of attack of the UAV which is variable and related to the landing direction. Additionally, in formula 6, ⇢ is the air density, s is the reference area of the UAV and cl is

the lift coefﬁcient related to the angle of attack. Further, from a control point of view, in order to successfully control the UAV, the normal acceleration required during landing should be equal to the normal acceleration which the UAV actually generates during the landing process. Therefore, for satisfying this condition, the acceleration is presented in formula (7) [18].

III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
This section contains the mathematical formulation of the optimal control problem (OCP) to achieve the goal considered in this paper. We assume that the path planning environment for the UAV is free of static and dynamic obstacles, which is the primary assumption in this study to reduce the complexity of the computation. Formulas presented in the following section are based on Figure 2 and Figure 3. To calculate the minimum time, we suppose that the UAV (interceptor) is ﬂying

at a constant speed of vu in the horizontal plane. Its objective is to reach the target (Drone Carrier), ﬂying at a constant velocity of vd in a given direction. For describing the motion, we used a coordinate system with an origin at the interceptor’s center-ofmass and with X-Axis direction parallel to the target’s constant velocity vector (Figure 2). The equations of motion illustrated at Figure 2 including the UAV and the drone carrier are as follows:

where x and y are relative displacements, ✓u is the interceptor’s heading angle, and Rc is the minimum turning radius of the interceptor. The variable c is the controller and its magnitude is bounded by unity, |c|  1. For simplifying the problem, the time dependency of all variables has been eliminated. We initiate the process at t0 = 0 to tf in the following optimal control problem (OCP).

The primary purpose of the cost function in this paper is dedicated to ﬁnding the minimum time required for the UAV to reach the charging platform while imposing a soft bound on the control variable via a positive weighting factor and quadratic form. This factor can be used to ensure that the control remains within its prescribed bounds. Consequently, the objective function in optimal control problem (Bloza

approaches may be used. In this study, we employed the Hamiltonian principle technique. The Hamiltonian is a function used to solve the optimal control problem of a dynamic system. It can be observed as an instantaneous increment of the Lagrangian expression of a problem that can be optimized over a certain time horizon. By using the deﬁnition of principle the Hamiltonian function H and B for boundary value problem (BVP) [19], we have:

H(t, x, c, ✓u, µx, µy, µ✓u ) = f0(t, x, c) + µx(x0(t)) (16)

+µy(y0(t)) + µ✓u (

By putting the related equation from (15) in (16), the Hamiltonian function computed as follows:
H(t, x, c, ✓u, µx, µy, µ✓u ) = µ⌥( c2) + µx(vd vucos✓u) (17)
+µy( vusin✓u) + µ✓u c
Now because:

@H = 0 @⌥

(18)

and from the transversality condition we have:

D⌥f = µ0

(19)

Then, we can obtain that:

D⌥ = µ0

(20)

By taking to account the autonomous conditions in our problem we can have:

Dtf = µ0 = H(tf ) = H(t)

(21)

Thus, the Hamiltonian is equal to µ0, and the remaining ad-joint equations are as follows:

Finally, the control equation is:

(26)

The next step is dedicated to ﬁnding the ✓˙u corresponding to the triangular collision in Figure 3 between the UAV and the drone carrier, which ﬁrst illustrates the path from the point of view of an astatic observer located at the initial position of the UAV, then deﬁnes the collision triangle between the two moving objects from an initial to a ﬁnal conﬁguration and determines where they would interact with each other. Based on the collision triangle and taking into account that the line of sight should not rotate with respect to the law of parallel navigation [20], we approached ✓˙u as follows:

For the calculation of the t˙f on the basis of the collision triangle, we have chosen a technique of order reduction in connection with the singular perturbation technique (SPT),

which is particularly noticeable in the design of the optimal

control, which requires the solution of state and cost functions

including initial and ﬁnal conditions [21]. Consequently, by applying the method of order reduction in equations (8-10)

we have found:

IV. NUMERICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS
To evaluate the performance of our solution and determine the minimum time a UAV needs to intersect the Drone Carrier. From the experimental parameters proposed in Table 1, we considered two case studies with open and closed loop control at = 0.08, which were selected for a moderately maneuverable UAV (Interceptor). The term ”closed-loop” or ”feedback form” means that instead of making one attempt to solve the problem at t0 with the given ﬁxed x0 and y0 with a ﬁxed ✓˙u, we repeatedly update the value of ✓˙u with the current measures of x0 and y0. Ultimately, this should greatly improve the accuracy of the results. In addition, (multiplier) has been adjusted so that the hard limit of control is not violated. Figure 4, presents the path of the initial state in both open and closed loop. (it is illustrated in the reference system of the interceptor). Figures 5 and 6 show the time records of the heading and control. As demonstrated, both controls resemble a similar approach, however, in terms of path planning both open and closed loop tend to signiﬁcantly differ, especially in satisfying the end conditions of the interception. In order to correct these, higher-order terms are implemented, for the control to remain in open loop. In the second case, however, the results look very similar and the control system is practically indistinguishable from the controller. This is not surprising, because we know that we are approaching the Zermelo’s problem when the UAV is highly manoeuvrable, so we use the Singular perturbation technique (SPT) to reduce this problem. The interception problem is solved to the ﬁrst order for both open-loop and feedback-loop. The open-loop solution applies to systems with initial and/or ﬁnal boundary layer, whereas the closed-loop solution can be applied to problems with initial boundary layer only. One of the major advantages of the SPT is the on-board implementation of optimal control techniques as direct inputs to the autonomous ﬂight control system. As a result, such an implementation requires the optimal control solution to be obtained in a feedback form. In addition, from Figures (7,4) and Figures (8,5) we can observe that changing the value of has an impact on the performance of open-loop and closed-loop, as we decrease the value the results are almost identical.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a path planning algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to reach the drone carrier for recharging through air-to-air landing. We calculate the

optimal route to reduce the ﬂight time and save energy, since the in-ﬂight power consumption is directly related to the total length of the ﬂight path. Singular Perturbation technique (SPT) and optimal control methods are implemented to enable the UAV to intercept the drone carrier. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in identifying the optimal travel path that leads to minimum travel time by using the closed loop numerical direct approach. Further development would include problem formulation in 3D with simulations under a practical environment such as ROS (Robot Operating System), which allows the sensor data to be considered and map out the surrounding environment to construct robust path planning.
