Abstract

In this paper, we show that the universal covering space of a surface can be used to unify previous results on computing paths in a simple polygon. We optimize a given path among obstacles in the plane under the Euclidean and link metrics and under polygonal convex distance functions. Besides revealing connections between the minimum paths under these three distance functions, the framework provided by the universal cover leads to simplified linear-time algorithms for shortest path trees, for minimum-link paths in simple polygons, and for paths restricted to c given orientations.

    Let be a set of points in the plane, no three in a line. The of specifies, for every ordered triple, a positive or negative orientation; and the (for short, ) of specifies, for every unordered pair of line segments spanned by , whether they cross each other. Keller and Perles (2016) proved that the x-type of can be reconstructed from the of noncrossing spanning trees. In this paper, we show that the x-type of can already be reconstructed from the , which is a subgraph of . The proof crucially relies on the analysis of (snes) between two disjoint planar straight-line graphs. snes are a bipartite analogue of triangulations of planar straight-line graphs; they correspond to maximal cliques in .

    Let be a simple polygon of vertices. We consider two-point shortest path queries in . We build a data structure of size in time such that given any two query points and , the length of an shortest path from to in can be computed in time, or in time if both and are vertices of , and an actual shortest path can be output in additional linear time in the number of edges of the path. To achieve the result, we propose a mountain decomposition of simple polygons, which may be interesting in its own right. Most importantly, our approach is much simpler than the previous work on this problem.
