Abstract. We introduce and study a new concept of parameterised topological complexity, a topological invariant motivated by the motion planning problem of robotics. In the parametrised setting, a motion planning algorithm has high degree of universality and ﬂexibility, it can function under a variety of external conditions (such as positions of the obstacles etc). We explicitly compute the parameterised topological complexity of obstacle-avoiding collision-free motion of many particles (robots) in 3-dimensional space. Our results show that the parameterised topological complexity can be signiﬁcantly higher than the standard (nonparametrised) invariant.
1. Introduction
To create an autonomously functioning system in robotics one designs a motion planning algorithm. Such an algorithm takes as input the initial and the ﬁnal states of the system and produces a motion of the system from the initial to ﬁnal state as output. The theory of robot motion planning algorithms is an active ﬁeld of robotics, we refer the reader to the monographs [17], [18] for further references.
A topological approach to the robot motion planning problem was developed in [8], [9]; the topological techniques explained relationships between instabilities occurring in robot motion planning algorithms and topological features of robots’ conﬁguration spaces.
In this paper we develop a new approach to theory of motion planning algorithms. We want our algorithms to be universal or ﬂexible in the sense that they should be able to function in a variety of situations, involving external conditions

which are viewed as parameters and are part of the input of the algorithm. A typical situation of this kind arises when we are dealing with collision free motion of many objects (robots) moving in the 3-space avoiding a set of obstacles, and the positions of the obstacles are a priori unknown. This speciﬁc problem serves as the main motivation for us in this article and we analyse it in full detail.
To illustrate our approach consider the following practical situation. A military commander controls a ﬂeet of n submarines in waters with m mines, which are movable and are relocated every 24 hours. Each morning the commander assigns a motion for every submarine, from the current to the desired positions, such that no collisions between the submarines or between the submarines and the mines occur. A parametrised motion planning algorithm, as we discuss in this paper, will take as input the positions of the mines and the current and desired positions of the submarines and will produce as output a collision-free motion of the ﬂeet. In this example the positions of the mines represent the external conditions of the system. In section 9 we study a mathematical version of this problem in full generality.
To model the situation mathematically we use the language of algebraic topology. We consider a map p : E → B which allows us to view E as the union of a family of ﬁbres X = Xb = p−1(b), parametrised by the points of the base b ∈ B. A choice of a point of the base b ∈ B corresponds to a choice of the external conditions for the system. The parametrised topological complexity TC[p : E → B] is a reﬂection of complexity of a universal motion planning algorithm in this setting; we also use the abbreviated notation TCB(Xb) = TCB(X) to emphasise its relationship to the ﬁbre. We establish several basic results describing the nature of this notion and in particular give lower and upper bounds depending on the topological spaces involved.
Our main result is described in Section 9 where we prove the following Theorem:
Theorem 1.1. The parametrised topological complexity of the problem of collisionfree motion of n robots in 3-space in the presence of m ≥ 2 point obstacles with unknown a priori positions equals 2n + m − 1.
This result can be compared with the known answer for the standard (i.e. nonparametrised) topological complexity of the problem of collision-free motion of n robots in the presence of m obstacles which equals 2n, see [11]. Thus we see that the parametrised topological complexity can exceed the non-parametrised one and their diﬀerence can be arbitrarily large, reﬂecting computational cost for ﬂexible motion planning. The result shows that, unlike ordinary topological complexity, each additional obstacle imposes a cost on the motion planner.
In this paper we consider robots and obstacles represented by single points which may appear unrealistic. However it is known that our approach is equivalent (under

certain conditions) to the situation when every robot and obstacle has convex shape, see for example [1], [3].
The main eﬀort of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is in analysis of algebraic properties of the cohomology algebra of a corresponding conﬁguration space, see Section 9.
Theorem 1.1 is stated for the 3-dimensional case, however our methods prove a similar result in Euclidean space of any odd dimension. The answer in the evendimensional case is slightly diﬀerent and its treatment requires diﬀerent tools. We plan to describe the even-dimensional case in a separate publication. We shall also develop explicit parametrised motion planning algorithms having minimal topological complexity for a variety of situations important for applications.

2. Parametrised motion planning

In robotics, a motion planning algorithm takes as input pairs of admissible states
of the system and generates a continuous motion of the system connecting these
two states, as output. Let X be the conﬁguration space of the system which is a path-connected topological space. Given a pair of states (x0, x1) ∈ X × X, a motion planning algorithm produces a continuous path γ : I → X with γ(0) = x0 and γ(1) = x1, where I = [0, 1] is the unit interval. Let XI denote the space of all continuous paths in X (with the compact-open topology). The map

(2.1)

π : XI → X × X, π(γ) = (γ(0), γ(1)),

is a ﬁbration, with ﬁber ΩX, the based loop space of X. A solution of the motion planning problem, a motion planning algorithm, is then a section of this ﬁbration, i.e. a map s : X × X → XI satisfying π ◦ s = idX×X . The section s cannot be continuous as a function of the input unless the space X is contractible, see [8].
For a path-connected topological space X, the topological complexity TC(X) is deﬁned to be the sectional category, or Schwarz genus, of the ﬁbration (2.1), TC(X) = secat(π). That is, TC(X) is the smallest number k for which there is an open cover X × X = U0 ∪ U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Uk and the map π admits a continuous section sj : Uj → XI satisfying π ◦ sj = idUj for each j. Refer to the survey [9] and the recent volume [14] for detailed discussions of the invariant TC(X), which provides a measure of navigational complexity in X. Recent important results on TC(X) were obtained in [4], [15].
In this paper, we pursue a parameterised version of topological complexity, where the motion of the system is constrained by conditions imposed by points in another topological space.
To describe the setting of parametrised motion planning consider a ﬁbration

(2.2)

p: E → B.

In general we only require (2.2) to be a Hurewicz ﬁbration but in most applications it will be a locally trivial ﬁbration. Here the space B parametrises the external conditions for the system and for any value b ∈ B the ﬁbre Xb = p−1(b) is the space of “real” or “achievable” conﬁgurations of the system under the external condition b (Example 2.1 below describes a speciﬁc situation of this kind). We assume throughout that the ﬁbre Xb is nonempty and path-connected for any b ∈ B. A motion planning algorithm takes as input the current and the desired states of the system and produces a continuous motion from the current state to the desired state. The additional conditions in the parametrised setting are: (a) the current and the desired states must lie in the same ﬁbre of p (i.e. they have to satisfy the same external conditions) and (b) the motion of the system must also be restricted to the same ﬁbre. In practical terms this additional restriction means that the external conditions represented by the point of the base b ∈ B will remain constant under the motion.
In the sequel we shall denote by
F (Y, n) = {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Y n | xi = xj if i = j}
the conﬁguration space of n distinct ordered points lying in a topological space Y .
Example 2.1. Consider a system represented by n pairwise distinct points in the k-dimensional space z1, . . . , zn ∈ Rk moving in the complement of a set of obstacles o1, o2, . . . , om ∈ Rk which are also pairwise distinct. In practical situations one has k = 3 or k = 2. Hence, zi = zj, oi = oj (for i = j), and zi = oj. In the formalism of parametrised motion planning, the base space B = F (Rk, m) is the conﬁguration space of m distinct ordered points in Rk representing the obstacles, the total space E = F (Rk, n + m) is the conﬁguration space of tuples (z1, . . . , zn, o1, . . . , om) and the projection p : E → B is given by p(z1, . . . , zn, o1, . . . , om) = (o1, . . . , om). A motion planning algorithm produces for two conﬁgurations, (z1, . . . , zn, o1, . . . , om) and (z1′ , . . . , zn′ , o1, . . . , om), a continuous motion
(z1(t), . . . , zn(t), o1, . . . , om) ∈ F (Rk, n + m), where t ∈ [0, 1],
with zi(0) = zi and zi(1) = zi′ for i = 1, . . . , n. Observe that the positions of the obstacles are not assumed to be known in advance but are rather part of the input of the problem to be solved by the planner.
The above example motivates the following general constructions and numerical invariants measuring the parametrised topological complexity; we brieﬂy describe these notions here and will examine them in detail in Section 4 and in the subsequent sections. For a ﬁbration p : E → B with ﬁbre X, let EBI denote the space of all continuous paths γ : I → E lying in a single ﬁbre of p, so that the path

p ◦ γ is constant. Denote by E ×B E = {(e, e′) ∈ E × E | p(e) = p(e′)} the space of pairs of conﬁgurations lying in the same ﬁbre. The map Π : EBI → E ×B E, γ → (γ(0), γ(1)), is a ﬁbration, with ﬁbre ΩX, the space of based loops in X. Recall that we assume the ﬁbre X to be path-connected. We deﬁne the parameterised topological complexity of the ﬁbration p : E → B to be the sectional category of the associated ﬁbration Π, i.e.
TC[p : E → B] := secat(Π).
If the ﬁbration p is clear from the context, we will sometimes use the abbreviated notation TC[p : E → B] = TCB(X) emphasising the role of the ﬁbre X.
We shall see below that the parametrised topological complexity of a ﬁbration p : E → B with ﬁbre X can be strictly greater than the topological complexity TC(X), in particular this is the case in the situation of Example 2.1 - collision-free motion planning with multiple obstacles.
As is well known, if Y is a manifold without boundary of dimension at least two, the forgetful map p : F (Y, n + m) → F (Y, m), p(x1, . . . , xn+m) = (x1, . . . , xm), is a ﬁbration, the Fadell-Neuwirth bundle, with ﬁbre F (Y {m points}, n). Results of Section 9 below yield that for k = 3 or more generally for any odd k ≥ 3 one has
TC[p : F (Rk, n + m) → F (Rk, m)] = 2n + m − 1
We may compare this result with the topological complexity
TC(F (Rk {m points}, n)) = 2n
of the ﬁbre found in [11] for k = 2 and k = 3 and m ≥ 2. 1 The diﬀerence between the parametrised and non-parametrised topological complexities TCB(X)−TC(X) in this example equals m − 1; hence this diﬀerence may be arbitrarily large.

3. Sectional category and its generalised version
In this section, we review notions of sectional category of a ﬁbration. The concept of sectional category was originally introduced by A. Schwarz [19], who used the term “genus”of a ﬁbration.
Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration; this means that p is a continuous map satisfying the homotopy lifting property with respect to any space, [20].
Deﬁnition 3.1. The sectional category of p is the smallest integer k ≥ 0 such that the base B admits an open cover B = U0 ∪ U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Uk with the property that
1Note that [11] deals with the non-normalised version of topological complexity which is by 1 higher than the normalised version which we use in this paper.

each set Ui admits a continuous section si : Ui → E; here si is a continuous map with p ◦ si : Ui → B equal to the inclusion idUi : Ui → B.
We shall denote the sectional category of p by secat(p) or more informatively secat(p : E → B). Note that secat(p : E → B) = 0 if and only if p admits a globally deﬁned continuous section.
If the base B is locally contractible (which is a typical situation for this article) then any point b ∈ B has a neighbourhood U ⊂ B with a continuous section U → E and the sectional category secat(p) depends only on the global topological structure of p.
For a path-connected topological space X the symbol cat(X) denotes the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of X. It can be deﬁned as the sectional category of the Serre ﬁbration p0 : P0(X) → X where P0(X) denotes the space of all continuous paths γ : [0, 1] → X with γ(0) = x0 (the base point of X) and p0(γ) = γ(1), i.e. cat(X) = secat(p0). It is easy to see that cat(X) can also be described as the smallest k ≥ 0 such that X admits an open cover X = U0 ∪ U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Uk with the property that each inclusion Ui → X is nullhomotopic, i = 0, 1, . . . , k.
There is also a notion of generalised sectional category of a ﬁbration p : E → B, which we denote by secatg(p : E → B) and abbreviate secatg(p):

Deﬁnition 3.2. The generalised sectional category secatg(p : E → B) of the ﬁbration p : E → B is deﬁned as the smallest integer k ≥ 0 such that the base B
admits a partition into k + 1 subsets

B = A0 ⊔ A1 ⊔ · · · ⊔ Ak, Ai ∩ Aj = ∅ for i = j,
with the property that each Ai admits a continuous section si : Ai → E. Note that here we impose no restrictions on the nature of the sets Ai; in particular we do not require these sets to be open.

Clearly one has secat(p) ≥ secatg(p). In a recent paper, Garc´ıa-Calcines [13] (see also [21]) proved that for a ﬁbration p : E → B with both spaces E and B
being ANRs one has in fact the equality

(3.1)

secat(p : E → B) = secatg(p : E → B).

Recall that a metrisable topological space X is an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR) if for any homeomorphism h : X → Y mapping X onto a closed subset h(X) of a metrisable topological space Y there exists an open neighbourhood U of h(X) ⊂ Y which retracts onto h(X). Refer to Borsuk [2] for a detailed discussion. Well known facts concerning ANRs include:

TOPOLOGY OF PARAMETRISED MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHMS

(i) Any ANR is locally contractible; (ii) Any polyhedron is an ANR; (iii) A metrisable topological space is an ANR if it can be represented as the
union of countably many open subsets which are ANRs.
For applications in robotics one may always restrict attention to the class of ANR spaces.
For convenience of the reader we recall the known cohomological lower bound for the sectional category:
Proposition 3.3. Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration and let R be a ring. Suppose that a set of cohomology classes u0, u1, . . . , uk ∈ H∗(B, R) satisfying p∗ui = 0 for i = 0, 1, . . . , k has nontrivial product u0 ⌣ u1 ⌣ · · · ⌣ uk = 0 ∈ H∗(B, R). Then secat(p : E → B) is greater than k.
Proof. Assuming the contrary, secat(p) ≤ k, let B = U0 ∪ U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Uk be an open cover with the property that each Ui admits a homotopy section si : Ui → E. Then ui|Ui = s∗i p∗(ui) = 0 and hence ui can be lifted to a relative cohomology class u˜i ∈ H∗(B, Ui, R), i.e. ui = u˜i|B. The product u˜0 ⌣ u˜1 ⌣ · · · ⌣ u˜k lies in the trivial group H∗(B, ∪ki=0Ui, R) = H∗(B, B, R) = 0 and hence the product
u0 ⌣ u1 ⌣ · · · ⌣ uk = (u˜0 ⌣ u˜1 ⌣ · · · ⌣ u˜k)|B = 0
vanishes which contradicts our assumptions.

4. The concept of pararmeterised topological complexity

In this section, we give the general deﬁnition of parameterised topological com-
plexity, and discuss some initial examples and results. We repeat some of the constructions mentioned brieﬂy at the end of section 2. Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration. We wish to deﬁne a topological invariant measuring the complexity of
motion planning algorithms in the family of conﬁguration spaces parameterised by p. Recall that such an algorithm is a rule taking pairs of points e0, e1 ∈ E with p(e0) = p(e1) = b ∈ B to a continuous path γ : I → Xb in the ﬁbre Xb = p−1(b) with γ(0) = e0 and γ(1) = e1. Denote by EBI the space of all continuous paths γ : I → E such that the path p ◦ γ is constant; these are paths lying in single ﬁbre of E. Let E ×B E ⊂ E × E be the space of pairs of conﬁgurations (e, e′) lying in the same ﬁbre, i.e. E ×B E = {(e, e′) ∈ E × E | p(e) = p(e′)}. Sending a path to its endpoints deﬁnes a map

(4.1)

Π : EBI → E ×B E, γ → (γ(0), γ(1)),

Clearly, Π is a ﬁbration with ﬁbre ΩX, the space of based loops in X, where X is the ﬁbre of p : E → B.

D. COHEN, M. FARBER, AND S. WEINBERGER

Deﬁnition 4.1. The parameterised topological complexity TC[p : E → B] of the ﬁbration p : E → B is deﬁned as the sectional category of Π : EBI → E ×B E,
TC[p : E → B] := secat(Π : EBI → E ×B E).

Explicitly, TC[p : E → B] is equal to the smallest integer k ≥ 0 for which the space E ×B E admits an open cover

(4.2)

E ×B E = U0 ∪ U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Uk,

and the map Π : EBI → E ×B E admits a continuous section si : Ui → EBI for each i = 0, 1, . . . , k.
We occasionally use the more compact notation TCB(X) for the parameterised topological complexity

TCB(X) = TC[p : E → B] = secat(Π : EBI → E ×B E).

For a ﬁbration p : E → B and a subset B′ ⊂ B, let E′ = p−1(B′), and let p′ : E′ → B′ denote the restricted ﬁbration over B′. Then we obviously have

(4.3)

TC[p : E → B] ≥ TC[p′ : E′ → B′],

or in abbreviated notation,

TCB(X) ≥ TCB′ (X) for B′ ⊂ B. In particular, if B′ = {b} is a single point, we obtain

(4.4)

TCB(X) ≥ TC(X).

In sections 8, 9 of this paper we shall see examples where strict inequality holds in (4.4). Moreover, we shall see that the diﬀerence TCB(X) − TC(X) can be arbitrarily large.
Next we consider a few examples where (4.4) is satisﬁed as an equality.

Example 4.2. Suppose that E = X × B is the trivial ﬁbration. In engineering terms it means that the external conditions are invariable (not changing). Then E ×B E = X × X × B and EBI = XI × B. In this case ﬁbration (4.1) reduces to p×id : XI ×B → X ×X ×B where p : XI → X ×X is given by p(γ) = (γ(0), γ(1)). Clearly the Schwarz genus of p × id is equal to TC(X). We see that in this case TCB(X) = TC(X), i.e. trivial parametrisation does not add complexity.

Proposition 4.3. Let p : E → B be a principal bundle with group G (a connected topological group). Then

(4.5)

TCB(G) = cat(G) = TC(G).

TOPOLOGY OF PARAMETRISED MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHMS

Here cat(G) denotes the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of G, see section 3.

Proof. Consider the homeomorphisms

F : E × G → E ×B E, F (e, g) = (e, ge),
and F ′ : E × P0(G) → EBI , F ′(e, γ) = (t → γ(t)e).
Here P0(G) denotes the spaces of continuous paths γ : I → G with γ(0) = 1 ∈ G. Let p0 : P0(G) → G be given by p0(γ) = γ(1). From the commutative diagram

E × P0(G) F ′

/ EBI

id ×p0

Π

 E×G

F

 / E ×B E

the sectional category of Π is equal to the sectional category of id ×p0. The latter clearly coincides with the sectional category of p0 which is cat(G), according to the deﬁnition, see section 3. This shows that TCB(G) = cat(G) and the equality (4.5) now follows from the inequalities TCB(G) ≥ TC(G) ≥ cat(G).

Example 4.4. Consider the Hopf ﬁbration S3 → S2 with ﬁbre X = S1. In this case B = S2 and TC(X) = TC(S1) = 1. By Proposition 4.3, TCB(S1) = 1 and we shall describe a speciﬁc motion planner. We think of S3 as being the set of pairs (z1, z2) ∈ C × C satisfying |z1|2 + |z2|2 = 1. The group S1 = {u ∈ C | |u| = 1} acts on S3 by u · (z1, z2) = (uz1, uz2) and the base S2 is the space of orbits of this action. We may represent the base S2 as C ∪ {∞} and then the projection p : S3 → S2 is given by p(z1, z2) = z1 · z2−1.
We shall describe a parametrised motion planning algorithm with two open sets

S3 ×S2 S3 = U0 ∪ U1.

Here

U0

the

of

all

pairs

((z1, z2), (z1′ , z2′ ))

satisfying

z1 z2

=

z1′ z2′

and

(z1, z2) = (−z1, −z2). The set U1 consists of all pairs ((z1, z2), (z1′ , z2′ )) satisfying

z1 z2

=

z1′ z2′

and

(z1, z2) = (z1, z2).

The

section

: U0 → (S3)IS2

can

be

deﬁned by

s0((z1, z2), (z1′ , z2′ )) = (t → (eitϕz1, eitϕz2))

where ϕ ∈ (−π, π) satisﬁes z1′ = eiϕz1 and z2′ = eiϕz2. The section s1 : U1 → (S3)IS2 can be deﬁned by the formula

s1((z1, z2), (z1′ , z2′ )) = (t → (eitϕz1, eitϕz2))

10

D. COHEN, M. FARBER, AND S. WEINBERGER

where ϕ ∈ (0, 2π) satisﬁes z1′ = eiϕz1 and z2′ = eiϕz2.
Proposition 4.5. If p : E → B is a ﬁbration with path-connected ﬁbre X, and TCB(X) = 0, then X is contractible. Conversely, if the ﬁbre X is contractible and E ×B E is homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex then TCB(X) = 0.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement follows from (4.4) and the known fact that TC(X) = 0 if and only if X is contractible. The second statement follows by applying obstruction theory. The ﬁbre of ﬁbration (4.1) is the loop space ΩX, which is contractible if X is contractible.

Remark 4.6. The case of Proposition 4.5 when the ﬁbres of p : E → B are convex sets is trivial, however a slightly more general situation when the ﬁbres are star-like is already not obvious.

Our main Deﬁnition 4.1 deﬁnes parametrised topological complexity using open covers of E ×B E. We note that:
Proposition 4.7. If p : E → B is a locally trivial ﬁbration and the spaces E and B are metrisable separable ANRs then in Deﬁnition 4.1 instead of open covers one may use arbitrary covers of E ×B E or, equivalently, arbitrary partitions
E ×B E = F0 ⊔ F1 ⊔ · · · ⊔ Fk, Fi ∩ Fj = ∅
admitting continuous sections si : Fi → EBI where i = 0, 1, . . . , k. In other words,
TC[p : E → B] = secatg(Π : EBI → B ×B E).
Proof. Due to the result of Garc´ıa-Calcines described earlier in section 3 (see equation (3.1)), Proposition 4.7 follows once we have shown that under our assumptions the spaces EBI and E ×B E are ANRs.
We note that the ﬁbre X of p : E → B is an ANR, being a neighbourhood retract of E (by [2, Chapter IV, Theorem (3.4)]). Secondly, X × X is an ANR, by [2, Chapter IV, Theorem (7.2)]. And ﬁnally, applying [2, Chapter IV, Theorem (10.5)], E ×B E is an ANR as it is the total space of a locally trivial ﬁbration E ×B E → B with ﬁbre X × X obtained by pulling back the product ﬁbration E × E → B × B along the diagonal ∆B : B → B × B.
Next, we note that the map EBI → B (which sends a path γ ∈ EBI to the constant path p ◦ γ in B) is a locally trivial ﬁbration with ﬁbre XI . Indeed, if U ⊂ B is an open subset such that p : E → B is trivial over U then the ﬁbration EBI → B is also trivial over U . Thus the space EBI is the total space of a locally trivial ﬁbration with base B and ﬁbre XI . We observe that XI is an ANR by [2, Chapter IV, Theorem (5.1)]. Now, since we know that both spaces B and XI

TOPOLOGY OF PARAMETRISED MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHMS

11

are ANRs we obtain that EBI is ANR as well, by [2, Chapter IV, Theorem (10.5)]. This completes the proof.

5. Homotopy invariance

Proposition 5.1. If ﬁbrations p : E → B and p′ : E′ → B are ﬁbrewise homotopy equivalent then TC[p : E → B] = TC[p′ : E′ → B].

Proposition 5.1 follows from the following observation:

Proposition 5.2. Consider the commutative diagram

where p, p′ are ﬁbrations, p′ = pf , p = p′g and g◦f : E′ → E′ is ﬁbrewise homotopic to the identity map 1E′ : E′ → E′. Then TC[p′ : E′ → B] ≤ TC[p : E → B].

Proof. Let ht : E′ → E′ be a homotopy satisfying p′ ◦ ht = p′ and h0 = 1E′ while h1 = g ◦ f . Let U ⊂ E ×B E be a subset with a continuous section s : U → EBI of Π. Consider the set V = (f × f )−1(U ) ⊂ E′ ×B E′. We want to describe a continuous section s′ : V → (E′)IB of the ﬁbration Π′ : (E′)IB → E′ ×B E′. For a pair (a, b) ∈ V and τ ∈ [0, 1] we set

 

h3(1−τ ) (b),

for 2/3 ≤ τ ≤ 1.

This proves our statement.

6. Product Inequality
In this section we establish a product inequality for parameterised topological complexity.
Proposition 6.1. Let p′ : E′ → B′ and p′′ : E′′ → B′′ be ﬁbrations with pathconnected ﬁbres X′ and X′′ respectively. Assume that the spaces E′, B′, E′′, B′′ are metrisable. Consider the product ﬁbration p : E → B, with ﬁbre X, where B = B′ × B′′, E = E′ × E′′, X = X′ × X′′ and p = p′ × p′′. Then,
TC[p : E → B] ≤ TC[p′ : E′ → B′] + TC[p′′ : E′′ → B′′].

Equivalently, in abbreviated notation,
TCB′×B′′ (X′ × X′′) ≤ TCB′ (X′) + TCB′′ (X′′).
Proof. Let Π : EBI → E ×B E, Π′ : (E′)IB′ → E′ ×B′ E′, Π′′ : (E′′)IB′′ → E′′ ×B′′ E′′ denote the ﬁbrations of (4.1). It is readily checked that EBI = (E′)IB′ × (E′′)IB′′ , E ×B E = (E′ ×B′ E′) × (E′′ ×B′′ E′′), and that the ﬁbration Π : EBI → E ×B E is equivalent to the product ﬁbration
Π′ × Π′′ : (E′)IB′ × (E′′)IB′′ → (E′ ×B′ E′) × (E′′ ×B′′ E′′).
Since the sectional category of the product ﬁbration is at most the sum of the sectional categories of the constituent ﬁbrations (see [19, Proposition 22]), the result follows.
Corollary 6.2. Let p′ : E′ → B and p′′ : E′′ → B be ﬁbrations over base B with ﬁbres X′ and X′′ respectively. Assume that the spaces E′, E′′, B are metrisable. Let p : E → B be the ﬁbration with ﬁbre X = X′ × X′′, where E = E′ ×B E′′ and p = p′ ×B p′′. Then,
TC[p : E → B] ≤ TC[p′ : E′ → B] + TC[p′′ : E′′ → B].
Equivalently, in abbreviated notation,
TCB(X′ × X′′) ≤ TCB(X′) + TCB(X′′).
Proof. Identify B with its image under the diagonal ∆ : B → B × B in the base of the ﬁbration p′ × p′′ : E′ × E′′ → B × B. The result then follows from Proposition 6.1 by applying inequality (4.3).

7. Upper and lower bounds

Let X denote the ﬁbre of a ﬁbration p : E → B. We note the following obvious inequality:

(7.1)

TCB(X) ≤ cat(E ×B E).

Let dim(Y ) denote the covering dimension of a topological space Y . We shall also use the notation hdim(Y ) for the minimum dimension dim Z where Z is a space homotopy equivalent to Y . We shall refer to hdim(Y ) as to homotopical dimension of Y . Using the known properties of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category we can write

(7.2) as follows from (7.1).

TCB(X) ≤ hdim(E ×B E),

TOPOLOGY OF PARAMETRISED MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHMS

13

Proposition 7.1. Let p : E → B be a locally trivial ﬁbration with path-connected ﬁbre X. Assume that the topological spaces E and B are metrisable. Then one has

TCB(X) = TC[p : E → B] ≤ 2 dim(X) + dim(B).

Proof. We apply the general upper bound for the sectional category [19] in terms of the dimension of the base, TCB(X) ≤ dim(E ×B E). Next we note that E ×B E is the total space of a locally trivial ﬁbration over B with ﬁbre X × X implying dim(E ×B E) ≤ dim(X × X) + dim B ≤ 2 dim X + dim B, cf. [5, Chapter 7].

The upper bound of Proposition 7.1 can be improved under connectivity assumptions on the ﬁbre X of p : E → B:

Proposition 7.2. Let p : E → B be a locally trivial ﬁbration with ﬁbre X where

the spaces E, B, X are CW-complexes. Assume that the ﬁbre X is r-connected.

Then

Proof. The ﬁbre of the ﬁbration Π : EBI → E ×B E (see (4.1)) is ΩX; it is (r − 1)connected. The asserted upper bound follows by applying [19, Theorem 5]. Note that the left inequality is strict and not ”less or equal”.

Proposition 7.3. Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration with path-connected ﬁbre. Consider the diagonal map ∆ : E → E ×B E, where ∆(e) = (e, e). Then the parameterised topological complexity TC[p : E → B] = TCB(X) is greater than or equal to the cup length of the kernel ker[∆∗ : H∗(E ×B E; R) → H∗(E; R)] where R is an arbitrary coeﬃcient ring. In other words, if for some cohomology classes u1, . . . , uk ∈ H∗(E ×B E; R) satisfying
∆∗(ui) = 0, i = 1, . . . , k
the cup-product
u1 ⌣ u2 ⌣ · · · ⌣ uk = 0 ∈ H∗(E ×B E; R)
is nonzero then TCB(X) ≥ k.

Proof. Consider the commutative diagram

where the map c : E → EBI associates with each e ∈ E the constant path c(e)(t) = e. Clearly c is a homotopy equivalence, and Π ◦ c = ∆. Therefore, the kernel of

Π∗ : H∗(E ×B E; R) → H∗(EBI ; Π∗R) coincides with

(7.3)

ker[∆∗ : H∗(E ×B E; R) → H∗(E; ∆∗R)].

Our claim now follows from Proposition 3.3.

Our next goal is to relate the kernel (7.3) with the ideal of the zero-divisors of the ﬁbre X, i.e. with

(7.4)

ker[⌣: H∗(X; R) ⊗ H∗(X; R) → H∗(X; R)].

Recall the classical Leray-Hirsch theorem [16, Theorem 4D.1]. Let p : E → B be a locally trivial ﬁbration with ﬁbre X and let R be a commutative coeﬃcient ring (typically Z or a ﬁeld). Assume that:
(a) For each q ≥ 0, the cohomology Hq(X; R) is a free ﬁnitely generated R-module.
(b) There exist cohomology classes cj ∈ H∗(E; R) such that their restrictions ι∗(cj) form a free basis of H∗(X; R) for each ﬁbre X, where ι : X → E denotes the inclusion.
The Leray-Hirsch theorem states that under these hypotheses the cohomology of the total space H∗(E; R) is a free H∗(B; R)-module with basis {cj}. Explicitly, the map

(7.5) Φ : H∗(B; R)⊗R H∗(X; R) → H∗(E; R),

bi ⊗ ι∗(cj ) → p∗(bi) ⌣ cj ,

is an isomorphism.

Proposition 7.4. If a locally trivial ﬁbration p : E → B with ﬁbre X satisﬁes the Leray-Hirsch theorem and the cohomology of the base H∗(B; R) is ﬂat as an
R-module then the kernel ker[∆∗ : H∗(E ×B E; R) → H∗(E; ∆∗R)] is isomorphic, as an H∗(B)-module, to

(7.6)

H∗(B) ⊗R ker[⌣: H∗(X; R) ⊗ H∗(X; R) → H∗(X; R)].

Proof. Applying the Ku¨nneth formula, we see that the cohomology classes

(7.7)

Cj,j′ = f ∗(cj × cj′ ) ∈ H∗(E ×B E; R)

restrict to a free basis on each ﬁbre X × X of the ﬁbration p′ : E ×B E → B where f : E ×B E → E × E denotes the inclusion; therefore the ﬁbration p′ satisﬁes the assumptions of the Leray-Hirsch theorem as well. We obtain an isomorphism

Φ′ : H∗(B; R) ⊗ H∗(X × X; R) → H∗(E ×B E; R)

TOPOLOGY OF PARAMETRISED MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHMS

which appears in the following commutative diagram

≃ Φ

 / H∗(E; R).

Here ∆X : X → X × X is the diagonal. To check commutativity one compares (7.5) and (7.7). We obtain that the kernel of ∆∗ coincides (after applying the isomorphisms Φ′ and Φ) with ker(1 ⊗ ∆∗X ). Since H∗(B; R) is ﬂat as an R-module we obtain ker(1 ⊗ ∆∗X ) = H∗(B; R) ⊗ ker(⌣).

This result may seem to suggest that under the assumptions of the Leray-Hirsch
theorem the cup-length of the kernel (7.3) equals the zero-divisors cup-length of the
ﬁbre. We shall see below that it is not the case. The isomorphism of Proposition 7.4 is only additive and in reality the multiplicative structure of ker(∆∗) is a deformation of the ideal of the zero-divisors of the ﬁbre.

8. Motion planing for a robot in 3-space and two obstacles with unknown in advance positions

Here we consider the situation of parametrised motion planning in 3-dimensional
space with two ﬂoating obstacles, it is a special case of the situation considered in
Example 2.1. This discussion is intended to illustrate our general Theorem 9.1. The obstacles are represented by two distinct points o1, o2 ∈ Rk where k = 3.
The position of the robot is represented by z ∈ Rk −{o1, o2}. The relevant ﬁbration is the Fadell-Neuwith ﬁbration

(8.1)

p : E = F (Rk, 3) → B = F (Rk, 2), p(o1, o2, z) = (o1, o2).

The ﬁbre of this locally trivial ﬁbration has the homotopy type of a bouquet of two spheres

X = p−1(o1, o2) ∼= {z ∈ Rk | z = o1, z = o2} ≃ Sk−1 ∨ Sk−1.

The base space B = F (Rk, 2) ≃ Sk−1, has the homotopy type of a sphere, and the total space E = F (Rk, 3) has the homotopy type of a 2(k − 1)-dimensional
CW-complex. Since the ﬁbre X ≃ Sk−1 ∨ Sk−1 of the ﬁbration (8.1) is (k − 2)-connected,
Proposition 7.2 shows that, for any k ≥ 2, the parameterised topological complex-
ity admits the upper bound

(8.2)

TC[p : F (Rk, 3) → F (Rk, 2)] ≤ 3.

16

D. COHEN, M. FARBER, AND S. WEINBERGER

We show below that for k = 3 one has TC[p : F (Rk, 3) → F (Rk, 2)] = 3. Note that the (unparameterised) topological complexity of the ﬁbre is TC(X) = 2, see [9].
Below we consider integral cohomology, skipping Z in the notation. It is known (see Theorem V.4.2 from [7]) that the space F (Rk, 3) has three (k − 1)-dimensional cohomology classes ω12, ω13, ω23 which satisfy the following relations

(8.3)

ωi2j = 0, and ω13ω23 = ω12(ω23 − ω13)

and generate the cohomology ring. Next we explain the relationship between
Theorem V.4.2 from [7] and the Lerey-Hirsch theorem; similar arguments will be
used later in this paper. First note that the class ωij is deﬁned as the pull-back of the fundamental class u ∈ Hk−1(F (Rk, 2)) under the projection on the i-th and j-
th particles of the conﬁguration; here the index i = 1 corresponds to o1, the index i = 2 corresponds to o2 and the index i = 3 corresponds to z. The classes ω13 and ω23 restrict to a set of free generators of the ﬁbre; hence we see that ﬁbration (8.1) satisﬁes the assumptions of the Leray-Hirsch theorem. The class ω12 generates the cohomology of the base B. By the Leray-Hirsch theorem the following classes form an additive base of the integral cohomology of F (Rk, 3) in positive degrees:

ω12, ω13, ω23, ω12ω13, ω12ω23.

The ﬁrst 3 classes have degree (k − 1) and the last 2 classes have degree 2(k − 1).
Relation (8.3) expresses the product of the “ﬁbrewise” classes ω13ω23 in terms of the generators in degree 2(k − 1) mentioned above. Note that the products ω12ω13 and ω12ω23 vanish when restricted to the ﬁbre.
The three term relation (8.3) represents the cup-product of the total space H∗(E) as a deformation of the tensor product algebra H∗(B) ⊗ H∗(X).
Next we consider cohomology of the space E ×B E which can be identiﬁed with the conﬁguration space of tuples (o1, o2, z, z′) ∈ (Rk)4 satisfying o1 = o2, z = o1, z = o2, z′ = o1, z′ = o2. By Proposition 7.4 the ﬁbration p′ : E ×B E → B satisﬁes the assumptions of the Leray-Hirsch theorem and hence the additive structure of
the cohomology is given by 5 classes

(8.4)

ω12, ω13, ω23, ω1′ 3, ω2′ 3

of degree (k − 1), by 8 classes of degree 2(k − 1)

(8.5) ω13ω1′ 3, ω13ω2′ 3, ω23ω1′ 3, ω23ω2′ 3, ω12ω13, ω12ω23, ω12ω1′ 3, ω12ω2′ 3,

and by 4 classes of degree 3(k − 1)

(8.6)

ω12ω13ω1′ 3, ω12ω13ω2′ 3, ω12ω23ω1′ 3, ω12ω23ω2′ 3.

TOPOLOGY OF PARAMETRISED MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHMS

17

Multiplicatively these classes satisfy the following relations

ωi2j = 0, ωi′j2 = 0 and two three term relations

(8.7)

ω13ω23 = ω12(ω23 − ω13), ω1′ 3ω2′ 3 = ω12(ω2′ 3 − ω1′ 3).

The ﬁrst relation (8.7) follows from the fact that the classes ωij are pull-backs of the corresponding classes in H∗(E) under the projection on the ﬁrst coordinate; similarly for the second relation in (8.7).
Finally we examine the map ∆ : E → E ×B E and the homomorphism induced on cohomology. Since ∆∗(ωij) = ∆∗(ωi′j) we see that the classes ω13 − ω1′ 3 and ω23 − ω2′ 3 lie in the kernel of ∆∗. We claim that the product

(8.8)

(ω13 − ω1′ 3)2(ω23 − ω2′ 3) ∈ H∗(E ×B E)

is nonzero. Note that here we use our assumption that k = 3 since for k even the square above would vanish, since then the class ω13 − ω1′ 3 has degree k − 1 (odd) and the square of any cohomology class of odd degree is zero. Our claim is
equivalent to the non-vanishing of the product

ω13ω1′ 3(ω23 − ω2′ 3) = ω13ω1′ 3ω23 − ω13ω1′ 3ω2′ 3 = ω13ω23ω1′ 3 − ω1′ 3ω2′ 3ω13 = ω12(ω23 − ω13)ω1′ 3 − ω12(ω2′ 3 − ω1′ 3)ω13 = ω12ω23ω1′ 3 − ω12ω13ω2′ 3.
We see that this class is the diﬀerence of two distinct generators from the list (8.6) and hence it is nonzero. Applying Proposition 7.3 combined with the upper bound (8.2) we obtain
TC[p : F (Rk, 3) → F (Rk, 2)] = 3
for k = 3.2 By Theorem 2.2 from [11], TC(R3−{o1, o2}) = 2 (in normalised notations). Thus
we see that the parametrised topological complexity in this example is higher than the standard (i.e. non-parametrised) one.

2Note that this argument applies without modiﬁcations to any odd dimension k ≥ 3.

9. Obstacle-avoiding collision-free motion of multiple robots in the presence of multiple obstacles with unknown in advance positions

In this section we generalise the result of the previous section in several directions: ﬁrstly we allow multiple robots moving ovoiding collisions, secondly we allow an arbitrary number of obstacles. Our main focus is on the case of 3-dimensional underlying space however our results are applicable more generally to Euclidean space Rk of any dimension k with the only restriction that k must be odd.
In the case when the dimension k is even the ﬁnal answer is slightly diﬀerent, it requires diﬀerent lower and upper bounds and will be described in a separate publication.
Our setting is as follows: we consider m ≥ 2 obstacles in Rk represented by pairwise distinct points z1, . . . , zm, there are also n robots represented by the points zm+1, . . . , zm+n ∈ Rk, these points must be pairwise distinct and distinct from the positions of the obstacles. As described in Example 2.1 we have to consider the Fadell-Neuwirth ﬁbration

(9.1)

p : F (Rk, n + m) → F (Rk, m),

where (z1, . . . , zm, zm+1, . . . , zm+n) → (z1, . . . , zm) and compute its parametrised topological complexity. In the previous section we considered the special case m = 2, n = 1 and k = 3. It will be convenient to use the notation p : E → B for (9.1); the ﬁbre F (Rk − Om, n) of this ﬁbration will be denoted by X. Here Om denotes a conﬁguration of m distinct points representing the obstacles.
To explain our assumption m ≥ 2 we note that in the case m = 1 the base
of the ﬁbration (9.1) is contractible and hence the ﬁbration is trivial. Example
4.2 shows that in this case the parametrised topological complexity coincides with TC(F (Rk − O1, n)) which is known [11].
In this section we shall prove the following theorem which can be viewed the
main result of this paper.

Theorem 9.1. Let k ≥ 3 be odd. The parameterised topological complexity of the motion of n ≥ 1 non-colliding robots in Rk in the presence of m ≥ 2 non-colliding
obstacles is equal to 2n + m − 1. In other words, the parameterized topological complexity of the Fadell-Neuwirth bundle p : F (Rk, n + m) → F (Rk, m) is

(9.2)

TC p : F (Rk, n + m) → F (Rk, m) = 2n + m − 1.

Note that for k = 3 the standard (i.e. nonparametrised) topological complexity of the ﬁbre of the Fadell-Neuwirth ﬁbration is 2n, see Theorem 5.1 of [11].3 Thus

3The arguments of the proof of Theorem 5.1 from [11] extend with minor modiﬁcations to the case k ≥ 5 odd.

TOPOLOGY OF PARAMETRISED MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHMS

19

we see that the parametrised topological complexity exceeds the standard one by

approximately the number of obstacles.

The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 9.1.

First, we apply Proposition 7.2 to get an upper bound. We note that the ﬁbre X

of the Fadell-Neuwirth ﬁbration (9.1) is (k − 2)-connected and hdim X = (k − 1)n,

while the homotopical dimension of the base is hdim B = (k − 1)(m − 1). Hence

the space E ×B E has homotopical dimension (k − 1)(2n + m − 1). Consequently, from the upper bound estimate of Proposition 7.2, we obtain TC p : E → B <

that

is

(9.3)

TC p : F (Rk, n + m) → F (Rk, m) ≤ 2n + m − 1.

This gives an upper bound in (9.2).
The proof of Theorem 9.1 will use the structure of the integral cohomology ring H∗(E ×B E), which we describe next.

Proposition 9.2. The integral cohomology ring H∗(E ×B E) contains degree k − 1 classes
ωij, ωi′j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n + m,
which satisfy the following relations

ωi2j = (ωi′j)2 = 0

for all i < j,

ωirωjr = ωij(ωjr − ωir) for all i < j < r,

ωi′rωj′ r = ωi′j(ωj′ r − ωi′r) for all i < j < r,

ωij = ωi′j

for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m.

Proof. A point of the space E ×B E can be represented by an (m + 2n)-tuple of the form

(z1, . . . , zm, zm+1, . . . , zm+n, zm′ +1, . . . , zm′ +n) ∈ (Rk)m+2n.

where the ﬁrst m points represent m obstacles, and the tuples (zm+1, . . . , zm+n) and (zm′ +1, . . . , zm′ +n) represent the initial and the ﬁnal conﬁgurations of the robots. Clearly, we require that for any i < j

(9.4)

zi = zj and zi′ = zj′ ,

and besides

(9.5)

zi = zj′ for i ≤ m;

20

D. COHEN, M. FARBER, AND S. WEINBERGER

note that index j in (9.5) automatically satisﬁes j > m. Conditions (9.4) and (9.5)
guarantee that no collisions between robots and between obstacles happen.
For any pair of indexes i < j satisfying either (9.4) or (9.5) we may view the corresponding pair of points as an element of the conﬁguration space F (Rk, 2) of pairs of distinct points in Rk. The space F (Rk, 2) is homotopy equivalent to the sphere Sk−1 and has therefore a fundamental class in Hk−1(F (Rk, 2)). Using this, for i < j one deﬁnes the class ωij ∈ Hk−1(E ×B E) as the pull-back of the fundamental class under the map E ×B E → F (Rk, 2) projecting conﬁgurations in E ×B E into the pairs (zi, zj). Similarly, for i ≤ m and j > m one deﬁnes the class ωi′j ∈ Hk−1(E ×B E) as the pull-back of the fundamental class under the map E ×B E → F (Rk, 2) projecting E ×B E onto the pairs (zi, zj′ ). Besides, for m < i < j ≤ m + n we deﬁne ωi′j as above by using the projection E ×B E → F (Rk, 2) on the pair (zi′, zj′ ). Finally we formally deﬁne ωi′j for i < j ≤ m by setting ωi′j = ωij.
All the relations mentioned in the statement of Proposition 9.2 are well known
to hold in cohomology of conﬁguration spaces, see [7, Chapter V]. Since our classes
are pull-backs of cohomology classes originating from conﬁguration spaces these
relations hold as well.

Next we introduce the following notations. We shall consider sequences I = (i1, i2, . . . , ip) and J = (j1, j2, . . . , jp) consisting of elements of the index set
{1, 2, . . . , m + n}

such that is < js for all s = 1, . . . , p; we shall express this by I < J for brevity. For each such pair I < J we deﬁne a cohomology class

ωIJ = ωi1j1 ωi2j2 . . . ωipjp ∈ H (k−1)p(E ×B E)

as the cup-product of the classes ωij deﬁned above. The classes

ωI′ J ∈ H(k−1)p(E ×B E) are deﬁned similarly where instead of the classes ωij one takes the classes ωi′j. The case p = 0 is also allowed; in this case we deﬁne ωIJ = 1 = ωI′ J .
A sequence J = (j1, j2, . . . , jp) is said to be increasing if j1 < j2 < · · · < jp.

Proposition 9.3. A free basis of the abelian group H∗(E ×B E) is given by the set of cohomology classes of the form

(9.6)

ωI1J1 ωI2J2 ωI′ 3J3 ,

where I1 < J1, I2 < J2, I3 < J3, the sequences J1, J2, J3 are increasing and J1 takes values in {1, . . . , m}, while J2 and J3 take values in {m + 1, . . . , m + n}.

TOPOLOGY OF PARAMETRISED MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHMS

21

Proof. We want to apply the Leray-Hirsch theorem to the ﬁbration E ×B E → B. Recall that E = F (Rk, n + m) and B = F (Rk, m) and the ﬁbre of this ﬁbration is X × X where X = F (Rk − Om, n). The classes ωij with i < j ≤ m originate
from the base of this ﬁbration. Moreover, it is well known that the cohomology of the base H∗(B) = H∗(F (Rk, m)) has a free additive basis consisting of the classes
ωIJ where I < J run over all sequences of elements of the set {1, 2, . . . , m} such
that the sequence J = (j1, j2, . . . , jp) is increasing. Clearly here p must be at most m − 1.
Next consider the classes ωI2J2 and ωI′ 3J3 where I2 < J2, I3 < J3 and the increasing sequences J2 and J3 consist of elements of the set {m + 1, . . . , m + n}. Using the known results about the cohomology algebras of conﬁguration spaces
(see [7, Chapter V, Theorems 4.2 and 4.3]) as well as the Ku¨nneth theorem we see that the restrictions of the family of classes ωI2J2ωI′ 3J3 onto the ﬁbre form a free basis in the cohomology of the ﬁbre H∗(X × X). Hence, applying the Leray-Hirsch theorem [16], we obtain that a free basis of the cohomology H∗(E ×B E) is given
by the set of classes of the form

(9.7)

ωI1J1 ωI2J2 ωI′ 3J3

where I1 < J1, I2 < J2, I3 < J3, the sequences J1, J2, J3 are increasing and J1 takes values in {1, . . . , m} while J2 and J3 take values in {m + 1, . . . , m + n}.

Using Proposition 9.3 one may show that the classes ωij, ωi′j are multiplicative generators of the cohomology ring H∗(E ×B E) and the relations mentioned in Proposition 9.2 form a deﬁning set of relation. However we shall not need this statement in this paper.
Note that the maximal degree of the class of the form (9.7) is (2n + m − 1)(k − 1) and the top degree is achieved by taking J1 = (2, 3, . . . , m) and J2 = J3 = (m + 1, . . . , m + n).
Next we consider the diagonal map ∆ : E → E ×B E.

Proposition 9.4. For any i < j the class

(9.8)

ωij − ωi′j

lies in the kernel of the homomorphism ∆∗ : H∗(E ×B E) → H∗(E) induced by the diagonal map ∆ : E → E ×B E.

Proof. The points of the space E = F (Rk, n + m) are represented by conﬁgurations (z1, z2, . . . , zn+m) of pairwise distinct points of Rk and ∆ maps such a conﬁguration to (z1, z2, . . . , zm, zm+1, . . . , zn+m, zm+1, . . . , zn+m) (where the last n points

22

are repeated twice. Our statement now follows from the explicit description of the classes ωij and ωi′j given in the proof of Proposition 9.2.

To prepare the tools to complete the proof of Theorem 9.1 we shall need Lemma
9.5 below. But ﬁrst a few notations. Let T ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , m} be a subset and let p > m. Consider the following cohomology classes in H∗(E ×B E):

ΩT = ωip and Ω′T = ωi′p.

i∈T

i∈T

The classes ΩT and Ω′T are not among the generators of Proposition 9.3 but they can be explicitly expressed in terms of the generators, see below.
From now on we shall assume that the dimension k ≥ 3 is odd; the degree of the cohomology classes ωij and ωi′j is then even and hence they commute. Besides, we shall formally introduce classes ωij with i > j based on the convention

ωij = −ωji. Lemma 9.5. One has the identities

j=m+1

It is a product of 2n + m − 1 elements of the kernel of the homomorphism induced by the diagonal map, see Proposition 9.4. Showing x = 0 will allow us to use Proposition 7.3 to obtain the lower bound

TC[F (Rk, n + m) → F (Rk, m)] ≥ 2n + m − 1

on the parametrised topological complexity of the Fadell-Neuwirth bundle. As this coincides with the previously obtained upper bound (9.3), Theorem 9.1 would follow.

Since we assume that k ≥ 3 is odd we have (ωij − ωi′j)2 = −2ωijωi′j (using Proposition 9.2). Hence x = 0 is equivalent to y = 0 where

Here I = {1, 1, . . . , 1}, and J = {m+2, m+3, . . . , m+n}; note that I is a sequence of length n − 1 consisting of 1’s. Using notations introduced before Lemma 9.5

(with p = m + 1) we may write

where T, S ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , m} run over all subset satisfying T ∩ S = {1} and T ∪ S =

Expanding the brackets gives a sum of many monomials, and each of these monomials is one of the generators described in Proposition 9.3. However some monomials appear several times and may potentially cancel each other.
Consider the monomial

(9.13)

−ω12ω23ω24 . . . ω2mω1(m+1)ω2′ (m+1)ωIJ ωI′ J

which arises by taking T = {1}, S = {1, 2, . . . , m}, i = 1 and α = 2. It is easy
to see that this is the only choice producing this monomial. Indeed, if the set
T contained an element i > 1 then the factor ω1i would be present which is not the case. If the set S would miss a certain element j > 2 then the factor ω2j would not be present, however all such factors are present. Thus, we see that the class y ∈ H∗(E ×B E) is nonzero since it contain as a summand one of the free generators which cannot be cancelled by any other term.
This completes the proof of Theorem 9.1.
