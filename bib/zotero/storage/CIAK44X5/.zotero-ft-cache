Abstract—This paper introduces a new vector ﬁeld guidance method to generate continuously ﬂyable paths for unmanned air vehicles. The central idea of the proposed vector ﬁeld approach is imbibed in the commanded course angle, which is expressed as a nonlinear function of the position error with respect to the desired path. Considering straight line and circular paths, the asymptotic behavior of position error is shown to converge to zero. Analysis of path curvature establishes a signiﬁcantly lower maximum value as compared to a popular existing method. Simulation results are presented considering a two-dimensional kinematic model of the vehicle. Overall, the method presents an easily computable path following solution with superior curvature characteristics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Applications of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have increased rapidly in recent decades, encompassing defense, agriculture, healthcare, and various civilian aspects. These missions often require a UAV to follow predeﬁned paths autonomously. Algorithms used for generating path following guidance command should be low in complexity, accurate in performance, issue commands within the vehicle’s dynamic capability.
The existing literature on path following guidance problem can be broadly categorized as virtual target-based approaches, control theory-based solutions, and vector ﬁeld-based methods. The virtual target-based framework utilizes classical missile guidance laws like a pure pursuit [1], line-of-sight guidance [2], proportional navigation and its variants [3], [4]. The guidance law directs a UAV to follow a virtual target moving at a ﬁxed look-ahead distance on the desired path which eventually drives the UAV to the path. One of the concerns with this class of solutions is the lack of virtual target existence guarantee in case there are signiﬁcant disturbances that increase the UAV relative separation beyond the prescribed look-ahead distance.
Several types of control design techniques have been developed for path-following problems in robotics that include various class of UAVs. Ref. [5], presents a survey of path following algorithms including methods like linear quadratic regulator (LQR), sliding mode control, model predictive control, back-stepping control, and adaptive control. An adaptive optimal UAV guidance law using linear quadratic regulator

(LQR) formulation is presented for tighter control on errors in the presence of high wind disturbances in [6]. Ref. [7] uses the optimal guidance for achieving terminal impact angle against a target for developing path following guidance logic. In [8], sliding mode control design is used to follow commanded course angle, thereby leading the UAV to the desired straight line or circular path. Ref. [9] proposes model predictive control to compute commanded heading direction for tracking of boundaries. Back-stepping controller design is used for underactuated follower-UAV equipped with pan-tilt camera to achieve the objective of following leader-UAV autonomously in [10].
Vector ﬁelds present a novel path following approach which fuses both the path planning and path tracking elements into one. By providing a commanded heading direction at each point in the workspace, vector ﬁelds provide guidance inputs that are robust to disturbances, obstacle avoiding deviations and other realistic perturbations. Vector ﬁeld based commanded course angle guidance for straight line and circular orbit is discussed in Ref. [8,11,12]. Nelson et al. [8,11] introduced vector ﬁelds approach wherein the tangent of the commanded course angle at a location was proportional to the positional error with respect to the desired path. Ref. [12], considers the lateral-error rate as a function of ground speed and relative course orientation error which is reduced to zero subsequently using the method presented in [8]. Stable course angle variation is not inherently guaranteed for these vector ﬁelds and Lyapunov’s direct approach was used to prove the same.
Lyapunov vector ﬁeld utilizes the property of positive definite potential function to construct a stable vector ﬁeld. The basic construction consists of a contraction term that governs the radial speed and a circulation term which controls the tangential speed with respect to the reference point or path. This approach is realized extensively in coordinated standoff target tracking scenario for stationary [13], and maneuvering [14], [15], [16] target. Lim et al. [15], presented a numerical integration method for calculating individual UAV paths to achieve simultaneous stand-off tracking of target at desired position and time, whereas, [16] proposed a modiﬁed Lyapunov vector ﬁeld that provides lower maximum curvature

limit while circumnavigating around a stationary target. In most of the path following methods, the focus is on
deducing smooth convergence to the path and curvature variation along the trajectory has not received signiﬁcant attention. Curvature relates directly to the turning rate capability of the UAV and is hence an important consideration in UAV path following guidance algorithm design. In this work, a new vector ﬁeld based guidance method is proposed for UAVs to follow desired straight line and circular paths. More versatile form of commanded course angle is proposed while considering curvature analysis to establish the signiﬁcance of the proposed vector ﬁeld method. As the main contributions of this work, a signiﬁcant curvature advantage is established for the proposed method.

II. PROPOSED GUIDANCE LAW
This section discusses the proposed guidance method for the path following problem. Considering straight line and circular orbit as two desired path following scenario commanded course angle is proposed in terms of the UAV position error with respect to the path. The nonlinear kinematics of UAV for a two-dimensional engagement scenario can be expressed as

x˙ = V cos χ

(1)

y˙ = V sin χ

(2)

where, (x, y) is the instantaneous position of UAV in cartesian coordinates. Here, χ, as mentioned above is the course angle measured with respect to the positive x-axis.

A. Straight line path following

The proposed vector ﬁeld guidance law considers a straight line path following scenario as shown in Fig. 1, wherein, UAV is at a distance x from the path to be followed, the desired course angle χd can be expressed as,



sin−1 

1 1+kl x2

,

if x ≤ 0

χd =

(3)

π − sin−1 

1 1+kl x2

,

otherwise

where kl is a positive constant given for straight line path

following. Fig. 2 shows the proposed heading angle proﬁle

with respect to lateral error considering kl = 0.005. It can

be seen that the proposed course angle varies smoothly to the

desired

course

angle

on

the

path,

that

is,

χ=

π 2

at

x = 0.

At

very large distances from the path, the commanded heading

is pointed along the shortest distance approach to the path,

that is, χ = 0 or π. The speciﬁc choice of course angle

variation is motivated by the resulting curvature characteristics,

more details of which will be discussed in Section III. The

commanded heading variation with different choices of kl is

plotted in Fig. 3. It is evident from Fig. 3 that higher values

of kl correspond to steeper variation in course angle near the

desired path.

The asymptotic behavior of proposed straight line path fol-

lowing guidance law can be veriﬁed using Lyapunov’s indirect

and, W˙ = 0 for x = 0

and hence by Lyapunov’s method of stability, the lateral error converges to zero asymptotically.

B. Circular path following

Consider a circular path following scenario shown in Fig.

4, where UAV is placed outside a desired circular orbit, and

instantaneous pose is represented in terms of polar coordi-

nates (r, γ). In this case, the commanded course angle χd is proposed in terms of radial distance r, measured from center

(xc, yc) of the desired circular orbit of radius rd as



χd

1 1+kc (r−rd )2

,

π − sin−1

1 1+kc (r−rd )2

,

if 0 < r ≤ rd r ≥ rd

(9)

where, kc is a positive constant for circular path following

scenario. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (9) corresponds to a commanded

course

angle

variation

with

χd

=

at

r

For

second

term in Eq. (9), the proposed course angle is directed towards

the center of circular orbit for r >> rd with χd ≈ γ + π and

it

attains

χd

π 2

at

r

rd.

The

UAV can be expressed in polar coordinates as

Similar to the analysis presented in Section A, we consider a

function

as

W

=

r˜2,

where

radial

distance

error

is

expressed as r˜ = r − rd. Upon differentiation of the function,

W˙ = r˜r˜˙

(12)

Using Eq. (10), in Eq. (12) results in

W˙ = r˜V cos(χd − γ)

(13)

Hence, the system is asymptotically stable about r = rd.

III. CURVATURE CHARACTERISTICS

Curvature variation for the proposed vector ﬁeld can be

obtained as

κ = dχd ds

=

dχd dt ds

= χ˙ d V

(17)

dt

From Eq. (17), it is clear that curvature is directly proportional to turn rate of UAV.

Using Eq. (3) and considering x > 0, the course rate can be obtained as

χ˙ d

=

2klx klx2) kl2x4

Using Eq. (1) and Eq. (3), in Eq. (18)

χ˙ d

cos χd

(19)

On further simplifying and rearranging Eq. (19)

χ˙ d

=

−

(1

2V klx + klx2

)2

(20)

Finally, using Eq. (17), an expression for the curvature can be

deduced as

κ

=

−

(1

2klx + klx2)2

(21)

The

curvature

maxima

can

be

obtained

on

solving

dκ dx

0.

Accordingly,

d dx

−2klx (1 + klx2)2

= 0, ⇒ x

=

1 √
3kl

(22)

Using Eq. (22) in Eq. (21), the maximum curvature can be

obtained

as

κmax

−9 8

kl 3

,

which

occurs

at

x

√1 3kl

.

B. Circular path

Similar to the case of straight lines, the expression of curvature for the circular path can be obtained by using Eq. (17) as

κ= r

1 1 + kc(r − rd)2

−

2kc(r − rd) 1 + kc(r − rd)2

2

for

all r ≥ rd

(23)

On differentiating Eq. (23), w.r.t r, a higher-order nonlinear

equation is obtained, which does not lead to feasible explicit

closed-form expression of maximum curvature.

IV. SIMULATION AND RESULTS

This section considers a two-dimensional kinematic model

for simulation studies with ﬁrst order course control. The ﬁrst

order course control considered for simulation results can be

expressed as

χ˙ = α (χd − χ)

(24)

where, α is a proportional gain constant. Considering straight line and circular path following scenario, UAV trajectory and corresponding parameters establishing successful convergence across the desired trajectory are plotted in subsequent sections.

A. Straight line path following

Consider an initial position of UAV at (x0, y0) = (90m, −90m) with a constant speed of V = 25 m/s is assigned

to follow the desired path at x = 0 m. The proposed vector

ﬁeld is generated using gain kl = 0.0015 which corresponds to a commanded course direction (using Eqn. (3)) of 176.4

degree at initial lateral error(initial x-cordinates) x0 = 90 m. Fig. 5a plots UAV trajectory to follow desired straight line

path at x = 0 m. Fig. 5b shows course angle converges to 90

degree at zero lateral error, thereby leading to the desired path.

Fig. 5c illustrates the convergence of lateral error to zero.

Fig. 5d demonstrate the comparative curvature performance

with Nelson et al. for straight line path following scenario.

The curvature maxima expression for considered commanded

course angle of 176.4 degree and given initial lateral error

results

in

κmax

=

−

2.59 x0

for

the

proposed

for Nelson et al., corresponding expression

method, is κmax

whereas,

=

−

6.12 x0

.

The curvature maxima so obtained for initial lateral error of

90 m, results in κmax = −0.028 m−1 at x = 13.45 m for

the proposed method, which matches the theoretical value as

discussed in Section III. Maximum curvature for Ref. [8], is κmax = −0.068 m−1 at x = 4.00 m. The comparative results

show the signiﬁcant advantage of the method offers in terms

of the maximum curvature of the path.

B. Circular path following
Consider a desired circular orbit of center (xc, yc) = (0m, 0m) and radius rd = 50m is used for simulation studies. Here, speed of UAV is kept constant at 25 m/s and gain kc is calculated for each case.
1) Initial point outside a circular orbit: For initial point outside the orbit, UAV is considered to be at (r0, γ0) = (100m, 5◦) with initial course angle χ0 = 150◦ and the gain constant kc used for simulation is 0.006. Fig. 6a shows UAV trajectory for path following of circular orbit. Fig. 6b illustrates radial error converges to zero in approximately 4 seconds. The corresponding radial distance converges to the desired radius of rd = 50 m as shown in Fig. 6c.
Fig. 6d illustrate the comparative curvature performance with Nelson et al. [8]. The curvature maxima for the proposed method results in κmax = −0.038 m−1 at r = 58.36 m, whereas, that for Ref. [8], maximum curvature is κmax = −0.107 m−1 at r = 52.31 m.

V. CONCLUSIONS
A new vector ﬁeld is proposed for straight line and circular path following. The proposed vector ﬁeld generates a commanded heading direction as an arc-sin variation of a nonlinear function of the position error throughout the domain of interest. Curvature analysis is carried out to obtain a closed-form expression of the maximum curvature for the straight line path following scenario. Simulation results show a signiﬁcant advantage for the proposed method in terms of the maximum curvature as compared to a popular existing method. Addressing variable curvature and validation with high ﬁdelity vehicle model are some future directions.
