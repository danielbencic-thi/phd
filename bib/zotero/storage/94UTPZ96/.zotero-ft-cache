Adaptation of Lazy-Theta* for UAS 3D path planning considering safety costs
Rafael Rey, Jose A. Cobano, L. Merino and F. Caballero 1

Abstract— This paper presents a 3D path planning solution for UAS to obtain a safe and smooth path. The safety plays an important role in the missions with UAS surrounding or entering the buildings. The heuristic search algorithms are good candidates to address this problem. The Lazy Theta* algorithm has been modiﬁed to foster safety and smoothness maintaining a distance from obstacles of the environment. Modiﬁcations to consider a new cost component related to the distance to the obstacles are performed. Tests in a realistic environment are shown to evaluate how the modiﬁed algorithm computes safer and smoother paths. Moreover, a comparison with the A* algorithm, the A* algorithm considering the new cost component and the original Lazy Theta* is presented.
I. INTRODUCTION
Safe and efﬁcient path generation is a key problem in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) applications where the robot has to navigate autonomously and close to obstacles such as building or indoors, for instance, disaster management [1], rescue operations [2], industrial inspection [3] and package delivery1, to name a few. Typically this planning implies a trade-off due to the challenges in computing safe paths, and the complexity of the generation of efﬁcient trajectories that can be executed with relatively low control effort.
UAS path planning has been extensively studied in the literature. Heuristic search algorithms such as A* [4] or D* [5], [6] have been frequently used for UAS path-planning. A common drawback of these discrete search techniques is that the computed path is not the shortest in continuous space because they are formed by grid edges. The Lazy-Theta* algorithm (a more efﬁcient variant of the Theta* [7]), has been proposed for UAV planning in several works [8], [9], [10], [11], as it offers certain advantages. As shown in [12], the algorithm leads to paths signiﬁcantly shorter than A* in 3D grids. Also, it produces smoother paths, avoiding the typical post-processing step required to smooth the zig-zag patterns that algorithms like A* provide.
Most former works focus on computing the shortest path. However, as discussed above, in many applications we need to consider at the same time other aspects, like safety, maintaining a distance from obstacles. This can be done by

considering additional cost factors when computing the optimal path, like the distance function with respect to obstacles. Lazy Theta*, however, cannot consider cost functions, as it is directly designed to minimize the Euclidean distance. A*, on the other hand, can consider generic cost functions, but the path will suffer from the same drawbacks mentioned above.
In this paper, we modify the original Lazy-Theta* [12] and extend it to consider the additional cost components while, at the same time, maintaining some of its advantages. The aim is to compute safe and efﬁcient 3D paths for UAS ﬂying close to building or crossing it. The modiﬁcations implemented foster safety. We provide comparisons with other search algorithms in order to evaluate the trade-off between safety and computation time.
The paper is organized into ﬁve sections. Section II reviews the literature on path planning. The proposed 3D path planning algorithm is presented in Section III. The experimental results and analysis is shown in Section IV, and ﬁnally Section V presents the conclusions.
II. 3D PATH PLANNING FOR UAS
Different types of approaches for tackling 3D path planning have been proposed in the literature: discrete search optimal algorithms, sampling-based algorithms and bioinspired algorithms. Among the search methods, A* [4], [13] and Theta* [14] are the preferred approaches in the literature. The zig-zag patterns of the A* are solved by the any-angle path planning Theta* [15]. A faster version of Theta* algorithm is presented in [16]. Another variation of the Theta* is the Lazy Theta* algorithm, which also optimizes the computational load of the algorithm by reducing the number of lines of sight checks [12]. As mentioned above, it has been proposed for UAV planning [8], [9], [10], [11].
Sampling-based algorithms such as RRT (Rapidly exploring Random Tree) have also been used in path planning [17]. A comparison between A* and RRT algorithms for path planning in UAS is presented in [18]. Variants of the RRT have also been proposed such as RRT* and RRT-Connect. RRT* produces very optimal paths at the expense of non real-time rates [19]. RRT-Connect achieves faster solutions but at the cost of obtaining longer paths [20]. The advantage of the graph-based methods with respect to sampling-based algorithms is a path closer to the shortest solution, and it is deterministic. Different probabilistic methods are used to solve the motion planning problem in UAVs but the planned trajectory can vary signiﬁcantly from one execution to another [21].

A class of methods also used for planning are those based on motion primitives. In [22], they are used for navigating through partially known environments with multicopters. Other alternative is to solve the optimal control problem using mixed-integer programming [23]. Bioinspired approaches imitate the behavior of humans or other animals, it is worth to mention Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) [24], and also genetic algorithms [25]. These algorithms generally require signiﬁcant computational resources, and their performance may vary depending on the scenario considered.
Heuristic search algorithms are used in this work due to the advantages previously mentioned, related to the path length and repeteability. Among the search algorithms presented, we choose the Lazy Theta* algorithm because computes shorter and smoother paths reducing the computation time with respect to Theta* algorithm.
III. 3D PLANNER BASED ON LAZY THETA* ALGORITHM
The proposed 3D path planning algorithm is based on the Lazy Theta* algorithm [12]. Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of the original Lazy Theta* algorithm and highlights the modiﬁcations implemented, that will be explained below.
The scenario is discretized into a 3D grid for the search algorithm. The voxel centres of the grid are the nodes s of the graph, and we consider a 26-node neighborhood. The aim is to ﬁnd a valid path from an initial node to the goal node without crossing obstacles. The algorithm assumes full observability of this grid.
Lazy Theta* is a variation of Theta* [12], which is a anyangle version of the A* [15]. Theta* creates the path without restringing it to the graph edges. The key difference between A* and Theta* is that the latter allows the parent of a vertex to be any vertex in the graph if it is visible from it. However, the associated line of sight checks increase the computational load, thus negatively impacting the performance in terms of path computation time.
The term ’Lazy’ in the Lazy Theta* algorithm comes from the fact that the algorithm reduces the line of sight checks performed during the search, buy delaying them until they are strictly necessary. Lazy Theta* assumes line of sight between nodes when expanding the search (ComputeCost in Line 30), delaying the most possible the line of sight check (which actually takes place in SetVertex in line 37). This is very important in 3D graph with respect to 2D graph because in 3D we have 26 neighbours for each vertex instead of the 8 neighbours of the 2D situation.
A. Variations on the original Lazy Theta* algorithm
This section describes the modiﬁcations performed on the original Lazy Theta*. The ﬁrst modiﬁcation tackles the separation of the obstacles by introducing a non-uniform cost related to the distance to the closest obstacle of each node, so safer paths are computed as they move further away from obstacles. This non-uniform cost is also a suitable way to consider traversability issues on the grid.
The second modiﬁcation relates to the line of sight in order to produce a smooth path that avoids the obstacles of the

environment and in turn fosters the safety. The line of sight feature links the different nodes of the path if they are visible to each other, so the possible beneﬁts of introducing the distance cost term to get safer paths could be lost. Therefore, a maximum line of sight distance helps to control the effect of considering distance costs during the evaluation of the cost of the grid nodes. Hence, in every line of sight check, if the distance between the nodes is higher than a maximum line of sight then there is no line of sight between these two nodes.
The modiﬁcations are shown in red in Algorithm 1. The resultant variant to compute safer paths is called Cost-Aware Lazy Theta* algorithm (CALT*). Next, both modiﬁcations of the Lazy Theta* algorithm are described in detail:
• Cost to reach a node. A new cost term, cobs(s ), is added to the Euclidean distance (g function deﬁned in Algorithm 1) in the original algorithm (see lines 33, 35, 40 and 41 of the Algorithm 1). For each node in the grid, cobs depends on the distance to the nearest obstacle. Then, the cost to reach a node is now a sum of the path length, g, and the new cost component for the nodes that deﬁne the trajectory, cobs. The latter component is weighted by a factor Cw which makes paths with larger safe margins with respect to obstacles depending on its value.
• Line of sight. The line of sight is limited to prevent the algorithm linking two nodes further than a given distance. Thus, a maximum line of sight distance is included, max in line 38 of the Algorithm 1, allowing the algorithm to link two nodes only if they are not further than this distance. If this distance is set to ∞ then we recover the original Lazy-Theta* algorithm. This will affect directly the number of expanded nodes.

B. Generation of 3D grid costs
The distance cost for each node of the grid evaluated during the search process is generated ofﬂine considering the distance to the closest occupied node to every node in our 3D Map, that is to the closest obstacle. For this purpose we generate a distance ﬁeld (DF) from either a PointCloud or an Octomap [26], storing for each node the distance to the closest obstacles and the associated cost. This avoids calculating it online every time the node is evaluated, with the corresponding computational cost saving.
We have chosen the same exponential decay function as the one used in the ROS Layered Costmap 2D [27]:

cobs(s) = W0 · e−cs f ∗DF(s)

(1)

where DF(s) is the distance to the closest obstacle in meters from state s, cs f is the scaling factor of the exponential decay, that modulates the decay ratio and W0 is the maximum cost for a node close.
Figure 1 shows how both modiﬁcations inﬂuence the path computed fostering the safety and smoothness. The inclusion of the maximum line of sight and the distance cost makes the computed path to surround the building depending on the

Inﬂuence of the CALT* algorithm: (a) Path computed considering the distance cost and line of sight without limits; (b) Path computed considering the maximum line of sight but not the distance cost; (c) Path computed considering both modiﬁcations of the proposed algorithm with weight cost 0.05; (d) Path computed considering both modiﬁcations of the proposed algorithm with weight cost 0.15.
weight cost (see Figure 1-d), instead of passing through of the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the building with a lower value of the weight cost 1-c). Figure 1-a shows the path computed when line of sight is not limited and the distance cost is considered. This path is very similar to one computed by the original Lazy Theta* because the effect of the distance cost is overridden when line of sight is not limited and so the path computed passes through the windows. Figure 1-b shows how the maximum line of sight inﬂuences without considering the distance cost. This path is smoother than the one computed in the ﬁrst case and the path computed passes through the windows again.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Many tests have been performed with each algorithm considering the scenario shown in Fig. 2. This scenario corresponds to Challenge 3 of the 2020 Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) held in Abu Dhabi (UAE) on February 20-25, 20202. The challenge required to autonomously detect, locate and extinguish ﬁres on different ﬂoors of a building, as well as in its surroundings. Safety is crucial in applications with UAS where the robot should approach to a facade or come into a building. Therefore, the proposed algorithm should be relevant in these applications.

Ubuntu OS 16.04 LTS. All the planning algorithms in this paper have been developed in C++ language and has been integrated in ROS (Robot Operating System) framework. Particularly, with ROS Kinetic Distribution.
This section compares results obtained with A*, A* considering the distance cost to the obstacles, Lazy Theta* and CALT* algorithms. Two paths are considered to evaluate each algorithm: the ﬁrst one is to ﬂy from one facade to the opposite one, the UAS can pass through the building or surround it (see Fig. 1); in the second one the UAS has to enter the building passing through a window (see Fig. 3). Path length, separation of the obstacles and computation time are the metrics used to evaluate the algorithms. We consider a 3D costmap for the distance to obstacles cost generated with cs f = 0.5 in (1).
Figure 1 shows the behaviour of each algorithm when the UAS should ﬂy from one facade to the opposite one. In this case, the distance cost makes the path crossing the building through a window, Cw = 0.05 (see Fig. 1-c)), or surrounding the building, Cw = 0.15 (see Fig. 1-(d)).
Figures 5 and 6 show the computation time and the path length with the A* considering the distance cost with different Cw, the original Lazy Theta* and CALT* algorithm varying the line of sight (LoS) and the cost weight (Cw). The computation time of the A* and original Lazy Theta* are 189ms and 335ms respectively. The inclusion of the modiﬁcations in the Lazy Theta* increases the computation time. Regarding to the A* considering the distance cost, the computation time is greater that the CALT* from Cw = 0.2. The times with lower cost weight than Cw = 0.2 is better than the one with CALT* but the paths are not smooth and presents abrupt changes of heading (see Fig. 1-(d) and 4).
Figure 6 shows how the path length increases with the line of sight and the cost weight. Once the distance cost is considered, the length increases as the path should be safer

and so they surround the building further. Note that the path length also depends on the line of sight as it slightly increases with lower line of sight because nodes are not linked from the maximum line of sight. The effect of both modiﬁcations of the CALT* shows the expected behaviour with respect to the safety.
Figures 7 and 8 also show the computation time and the path length with the CALT* but when the UAS has to enter the building. In this case, the computation time with the A* is 368ms and the one with the original Lazy Theta* is 489ms. Again the path length computed by the CALT* is shorter than the one of the A* considering the distance cost (see Fig. 3-(c) and 8) the path computed by CALT* is safer and smoother, passing farther from the edges of the window (see Fig. 3-(d)).
Figure 9 illustrates how safer, smoother and longer paths are computed as the cost weight increases with the same line

of sight, LoS = 2.5. Red and blue areas show the distanceto-obstacle costs, red area represents higher cost area and blue red lower cost areas. It can be observed as the cost weight increases, the path moves from the red areas to the blue areas, so the path run away from the building resulting in a safer and longer path.
The inﬂuence of the distance to obstacle cost on the safety

of the path when UAS has to enter into the building is shown in Fig. 3. The path computed by A* and the original Lazy Theta* passes close to the edges of the window. The path of the A* presents abrupt changes of heading and instead the Lazy Theta* computes a shorter and smoother path than the A*, 7.75m and 10.00m respectively. However, both A* with the new cost and CALT* compute safer paths because they pass farther from the edges of the window (Fig. 3-c and Fig. 3-d). The smoothness of the paths are very different and the path length is 12.59m with the A* considering the distance cost (with Cw = 0.15) and 8.88m with the CALT* (with LoS = 2.5m and Cw = 0.15). Regarding the Lazy Theta*, the path length of the CALT* is greater than the original one and is still less than the path length computed by the A*.
Therefore, the improvements of the CALT* with respect the safety when UAS navigates close to obstacles such as building or indoors are shown from the result obtained. Considering the trade-off due to safety and computation time, the cost weight should be considered with small values in the scenario considered. Note that A* considering the distance cost can take lower times but the path computed is less safe because it approaches more to the obstacles and the path has more changes of heading and is longer (see Fig. 3). In the rest of cases the CALT* also improves to the other algorithms tested with respect to the computation time.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
A 3D path planning algorithm considering safety costs has been presented in this paper. The aim is to foster safety in missions of UAS navigating autonomously and close to obstacles such as buildings or indoors.
A Lazy Theta* algorithm has been modiﬁed to compute safe and smoother path maintaining its advantages. The modiﬁcations introduce a non-uniform cost related to the distance from the closed obstacles and a limitation of the line of sight in order to ensure the effect of the new cost component.
Experimental results show the performance of the CALT* considering the safety, smoothness and computation time.

After analyzing the data obtained, the distance cost introduced should be considered in the cost function with small values of the cost weight parameter. A comparison with A* algorithm, A* considering the distance cost and the original Lazy Theta* algorithm is also performed to show the advantages of the proposed algorithm.
Future work will be focused on studying the inﬂuence of different distance costs on the modiﬁed Lazy Theta* algorithm and the consideration of partial-observability for replanning and moving obstacles. The computation time is crucial for replanning when moving obstacles are detected, so the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithm should be improved. Moreover, the authors will evaluate to incorporate the dynamics of the UAS in the algorithm to compute

trajectories. State lattices could be considered although can be computationally expensive.
