Abstract

The paper proposes a method that uses topological information to guide the path search in any 2D workspace. Our method generates topological paths taking into consideration the constraints of the workspace. Then, a path planner based on the A * , called Homotopic A * (HA * ), guides the path search in the workspace using the generated topological paths. Simulated and real results with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are presented showing the feasibility of the proposal. Comparison with well-known path planning algorithms has also been included.
