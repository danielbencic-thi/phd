Abstract Path planning is one of the most important steps in the navigation and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It ensures an optimal and collision-free path between two locations from a starting point (source) to a destination one (target) for autonomous UAVs while meeting requirements related to UAV characteristics and the serving area. In this paper, we present an overview of UAV path planning approaches classified into five main categories including classical methods, heuristics, meta-heuristics, machine learning, and hybrid algorithms. For each category, a critical analysis is given based on targeted objectives, considered constraints, and environments. In the end, we suggest some highlights and future research directions for UAV path planning.

1 Introduction
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a class of flying, mobile robots able to perform various tasks and navigate in dynamic environments. In the beginning, UAVs were dedicated for military applications, by 1930. They were experimented during the second world war [1]. A few years after, the deployment of UAVs appeared in civil applications and became more frequent. Nowadays, we can see that UAVs are used in many fields such as security and surveillance [2, 3], agriculture [4, 5], meteorology [6, 7], archaeology [8, 9], etc. They serve especially for reaching inaccessible areas and in emergency cases (disaster rescue) [10, 11]. With more automation, UAVs are considered as autonomous vehicles able to make appropriate decisions according to their autonomy level.

UAV Path planning is one of the most important problems in the navigation and control of UAVs [12]. Its main objective is to find the optimal and collision-free trajectory to reach the desired destination by satisfying some criteria such as length (distance), smoothness, cost, computational time, and energy. To achieve these objectives, path planning needs to face with some constraints related to the UAV’s physical characteristics such as energy, velocity, and UAV’s axes. The path planning is conditioned by the work-space depending on whether it is urban, rural, or authorized. In Europe and some partner countries, the EUROCONTROL organization manages and coordinates the exploitation of UAVs with Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) by defining a set of regulations [13] and prohibited flying areas [14]. The urban environment is a challenging area, it is characterized by cluttered areas that are complicated and complex. Particularly,

to improve the efficiency of UAV’s operations in urban, sub-urban, and inter-city areas, The Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) launched a two years project called CORUS-XUAM [15]. The main objective of this project is to establish new technologies, concepts, and rules for the deployment of airspace systems in these areas [16]. In fact, buildings and moving vehicles present a large risk to the movement of UAVs. They are considered as obstacles that may lead UAVs to make dangerous maneuvers and rotations that can cause physical damages. Nevertheless, rural zones are characterized by a less density of obstacles. Therefore, UAVs are less vulnerable to damages. On the other side, in high-level altitude, UAVs suffer less from the obstacles as the number of threats decreases but it makes them greedy in energy consumption. To overcome that, the energy sources of UAVs are multiplied. Actually, UAVs can be powered by fuel, battery, chemical substances, and solar cells [17].
Path planning is an NP-hard problem. Several research works have been presented to solve it with classical techniques, heuristics, meta-heuristics, and machine learning approaches. In the past couple of years, some surveys overview the different approaches. Each of them brings a contribution as it is summarized in Table 1. In fact, in [18], authors focused on the UAV path planning using classical algorithms using velocity and acceleration as criteria of classification. Yang et al. [19] presented a survey of UAV path planning approaches categorized into five classes including sampling-based, node-based, mathematical-based, bioinspired-based, and multi-fusion-based approaches. Pandey

et al. [20] reviewed the UAV path planning optimization based on meta-heuristic algorithms. Zhao et al. [21] surveyed meta-heuristics and machine learning algorithms used for optimizing the UAV path planning. Radmanesh et al. [22] introduced some UAV path planning objectives and presented UAV path planning approaches classified into classical and heuristic techniques. Aggarwal and Kumar [23] presented UAV path planning techniques classified into three categories including representative techniques, coordinate techniques, and non-coordinate techniques. Despite that, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work classified the path planning techniques according to the approaches they used. To address this, we propose through this paper a comprehensive review of researches related to UAV path planning by distinguishing five families: classical methods, heuristics, meta-heuristics, machine learning, and hybrid approaches.
This paper gathers publications from several credible databases such as IEEE, Springer, Taylor and Francis, World Scientific, and Elsevier as shown in Table 2. Fig. 1 presents the number of UAV path planning publications by database and by publication type. We can see that most of the conferences targeted IEEE database, while we notice a balance in journal publications between Elsevier, IEEE, and Springer. The names of the concerned journals are detailed in the top 10 ranking given in Table 3. Fig. 2 illustrates the number of UAV path planning publications by year. In the last four years, this field recorded a great rise with a peak reached in 2018. Fig. 4 represents the distribution of publication we

3.2 Path Planning Constraints

4 Path Planning Approaches Classification

3.2.1 Altitude
Altitude is directly related to the safety of UAVs. In fact, when UAVs fly at a low level of altitude, then the number of obstacles increases. Consequently, collisions probability increases. On the other hand, flying at a high level of altitude increases the energy consumption of UAVs. The altitude is given in meters.

In the literature, several path planning approaches were proposed in the UAV area. We propose in the following a classification based on the type of the used Algorithm. As shown in Fig. 5, we distinguish five categories: methods based on classical approaches, methods using heuristics, methods using meta-heuristics, those applying machine learning, and hybrid methods (Tables 6 and 7).

3.2.2 Climb/Descend Angles

4.1 Classical Approaches

Climb and descend angles are presented as necessary angles of UAVs for taking off, landing, and moving between multiple heights. They are measured in degrees. Climb and descend angles influence energy consumption, especially for fixed-wings.
3.2.3 Energy Consumption

Various classical approaches were developed for solving the UAV path planning problem including Rapid-exploring Random Trees (RRT) [61], Voronoi Diagram (VD) [62], Artificial Potential Field (APF) [63], Visibility Graph (VG) algorithm [64], Dijkstra algorithm [65], and Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) algorithm [66]. They are summarized in Fig. 6 and Table 8.

Energy consumption is represented as the power consumed by UAVs in terms of fuel, battery, chemical substances, or solar panels. It depends on traveling time, distance, altitude, and also the nature of the served environment. The energy consumption is given in Watts
3.2.4 Obstacles and Threats
Obstacles are defined as any objects that interrupt UAVs path. Obstacles can be static (such as buildings, mountains, trees...) or dynamic like moving objects and vehicles. Radars and missiles are considered as real threats since the radar can detect UAVs and missile damages them by their attacks.
3.2.5 UAV’s Axes
UAV in motion performs multiple rotations in three dimensions. These rotations revolve around three main axes, which are pitch, roll, and yaw angle axes.
3.2.6 Velocity
Velocity is a constraint for UAVs in the context of path planning. It affects directly the fuel consumption and the safety of UAVs during the path planning process. It is preferred to take into consideration a rational velocity to preserve energy.

4.1.1 Rapid‑Exploring Random Trees Algorithm
Yang et al. [24] developed a novel approach, called Gaussian Process-based RRT (GP-RRT), based on the integration of Gaussian Process (GP) map-building model into RRT algorithm for tackling the UAV path planning problem. The effectiveness of GP-RRT algorithm was evaluated in two test areas (urban and 3D cluttered environments) using Rotary UAV. Simulation results showed that GP-RRT provides a safe and collision-free path in the most complex 3D environment.
In the work of Kothari and Postlethwaite [25], an enhanced RTT algorithm, called Chance Constraint-RRT (CC-RRT), based on the introduction of Chance Constraint approach [67] into RRT algorithm for solving the real-time UAV path planning problem. The performance of CC-RRT was validated using two scenarios. In the first one, experiments were performed with the presence of 4, 20, and 25 obstacles. In the second one, 4 static obstacles and one dynamic obstacle were used. Experimental results proved that CC-RRT is more efficient compared to the standard RRT on real-time detection, cost optimization, and avoidance of dynamic obstacles.
Lin and Saripalli [26] proposed an improved RTT algorithm based on the integration of Dubins curves strategy into RTT algorithm for optimizing the UAV path planning in an indoor environment. The robustness of the improved RRT algorithm was tested in a 3D environment using Parrot ARDrone with the presence of 6 static obstacles, 24 virtual moving obstacles, and 20 real dynamic obstacles.

Experimental results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles in real-time.
Xinggang et al. [27] suggested a Variable Probabilitybased Bidirectional RRT (VPB-RRT) algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of the VPB-RRT algorithm was evaluated in a 3D environment with two experiences. In the first experience, 6 static obstacles were used in a simple study area. In the second one, 7 static obstacles and one complex barrier were distributed randomly in the area. The superiority of VPB-RRT was demonstrated in terms of path length and planning time compared to A*, RRT, and RRT-Connect [68].
Yang et al. [28] proposed a novel model, called EPF-RRT, based on the integration of Potential Field into the original RTT for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of EPF-RRT was validated using simple and complex obstacles taking into account path length and time cost metrics. Experimental results demonstrated that EPFRRT provides good performance compared to the traditional RRT in terms of path length and execution time.
Zu et al. [29] suggested an improved RRT (IRRT) algorithm for solving the multi-UAVs trajectory planning problem. The IRRT algorithm was tested using three experiences in a 2D study area. In the first experience, 2 UAVs were used and their paths were generated in a way that conflict occurred. The second experience used 5 UAVs and 7 circular obstacles with trajectory conflict. In the last one, 5 UAVs and 15 circular obstacles were distributed without conflict. Experimental results demonstrated the efficiency of improved RRT in the cooperation of multiple UAVs under conflict circumstances. Improved RRT algorithm reached the target in an acceptable time in case of unpredictable threats presence.
Sun et al. [30] developed an Improved RRT (Im-RRT) algorithm based on the integration of dynamic pg value and dynamic step length in RRT algorithm for optimizing the UAV path planning. The effectiveness of Im-RRT was assessed in a 2D area with the presence of 25, 75, and 100 static obstacles. Experimental results demonstrated that Im-RRT outperforms Bi-RRT [69] and RRT of path length generation and execution time.
Meng et al. [31] proposed a novel approach based on RRT algorithm for optimizing the UAV path planning. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in a real 3D complex topography containing mountains taking into account three constraints such as altitude, pitch angles, and range of UAV in flying missions. It was demonstrated that the improved RRT algorithm is appropriate for the 3D environment since it ensures a safe and collision-free path with a wider range.
Wen et al. [32] proposed Heuristic Dynamic Domain RTT (HDDRRT) algorithm based on the hybridization of Dynamic Domain RTT [70] and an extension of RTT

Simulation results validated the strength of HDDRTT in terms of selecting safe paths and avoiding obstacles in dangerous environments.
Lee et al. [33] presented a Bidirectional Spline-RRT* (BS-RRT*) algorithm based on the integration of the spline method [72] into RRT algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of the BS-RRT* algorithm was validated in two study cases using small RC aircraft. In the first case, UAV has a fixed altitude and the flight is in 2D. In the second case, UAV is free to move in three directions. Experimental results proved that the Bidirectional spline-RRT* algorithm provides a safe and smooth path for fixed-wing UAVs by satisfying the constraints related to fixed-wing flight.
Aguilar et al. [34] suggested a novel approach based on the combination of RRT* Goal [34] and RTT* Limit [34] algorithms for UAV path planning problem. The effectiveness of RRT*GL was assessed in a 3D environment using RGB-D sensors to collect the work-space environment. Simulation results showed that RRT*GL provides better performance compared to original RRT, RRT*, RRT* Goal, and RTT* Limit in terms of optimal path, execution time, and energy efficiency.
Meng et al. [35] developed an Informed RRT* (IRRT*) algorithm based on the integration of the oblique cylinder subset method into RRT* algorithm for optimizing the UAV path planning. The performance of IRRT* was evaluated in a 3D cubic area test using 1, 3, and 6 ground cylindrical obstacles. Experimental results proved the superiority of IRRT*

algorithm compared to the traditional RRT* algorithm in terms of path length optimization and safe flying in larger search areas.
Mechali et al. [36] suggested a Rectified RRT* algorithm based on integrating the smoothing method into RRT* algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The effectiveness of Rectified RRT* was validated in a 3D real environment using 3 parallel piped and parallel segment obstacles separately with the presence of 1, 2, and 3 static obstacles. According to the simulation, Rectified RRT* provided a smooth and short trajectory compared to RRT* algorithm. Moreover, Rectified RRT* optimizes energy consumption.
4.1.2 Voronoi Diagram
Bortoff [37] introduced the Voronoi Diagram algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The author evaluated the Voronoi Diagram algorithm in two cases with 10 known obstacles and 2 random radars. In both cases, simulation results demonstrated that the Voronoi Diagram algorithm generates optimal path length while keeping a safe distance from threats.
In another work, Chen et al. [38] developed an improved Voronoi Diagram algorithm based on the integration of Consistence theory [73] into Voronoi Diagram for solving the multiple UAVs path planning problem. The effectiveness of the improved Voronoi Diagram algorithm was experienced in a static environment with 3 moving UAVs in a square area. Simulation results proved the robustness of the presented method in terms of collision-avoidance and path length optimization.

Baek and Han [39] suggested a modified Voronoi Diagram algorithm (mVD) for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of mVD was estimated using 1 UAV and 15 sensors distributed randomly in a square area of 300 × 300 [m2 ]. Experimental results showed that mVD performs better traditional VD, CSS [74], and exhaustive search [75] algorithms in terms of computation complexity and energy consumption optimization.

of heuristic approaches is given in Table 9. Hereafter, we present some of them.
4.2.1 A‑Star Algorithm

Fig. 7  Classical approaches for UAV path planning
4.1.7 Analysis
As presented in the subsection above, several classical approaches such as RRT, VD, APF, VG, Dijkstra, and PRM are proposed for solving the UAV path planning problem. The main reason of their success is their easy implementation while giving good results in terms of Path optimization, fast solution generation, and efficiency for static environments with simple obstacles. The pros and cons of each of them are provided in Table 7.
We can see clearly from Fig. 7 that APF algorithm is the most applied approach thanks to its easy implementation, fast convergence, and low time complexity. However, it has some weaknesses such as poor performance, low efficiency, and failure in case of the presence of multiple obstacles, especially, when they are close to each other. In this case, it is RRT that performs well and gives good solutions with completeness guaranteed. Nevertheless, RRT does not take into account the length of the path. To overcome this issue, PRM and Dijkstra algorithms were applied to provide an optimal path length and manage the complexity of obstacles. VG and VD are two famous classical algorithms that are both able to solve the real-time UAV path planning problem. Therefore, VG is not suitable for complex obstacles’ shapes and its efficiency decreases when the number of obstacles increases. VD overcomes this issue by ensuring more safety, but no optimal paths are guaranteed in terms of length.
4.2 Heuristic Approaches
For solving the UAV path planning, many heuristic-based algorithms were proposed as shown in Fig. 8. The summary

In path planning, A-Star (A*) algorithm is a popular heuristic algorithm, it was firstly introduced by Hart et al. [97].
Dong et al. [78] proposed a Virtual Force A* (HVFA) algorithm based on the introduction of virtual force method [98] into A* algorithm for solving the UAV path re-planning problem. The performance of HVFA algorithm was assessed in 4 experiences. In the first and second experiences, HVFA was performed in a 2D environment using 10 circle obstacles in comparison with A* algorithm. In the 2 last experiences, the level of threats was increased and HFVA algorithm was performed in comparison to Fuzzy virtual Force (FVF) [98]. It was demonstrated that HVFA provides better performance compared to A* and FVF in terms of path cost and execution time (Table 10).
Geng et al. [77] suggested A* algorithm for solving multiUAVs path planning problem. The effectiveness of A* was evaluated in a 3D environment in 2 cases. In the first case, one cubic obstacle with mountains was used in the simulation. In the second case, only the mountains were used. According to experimental results, A* algorithm provides an optimal path compared to other path planning approaches. However, computation time is a little higher due to supplementary processing when stealth is considered.
Wang et al. [79] proposed an improved A* algorithm, called Dubins-Sparse A-Star (Dubins-SAS) algorithm, based on the integration Dubins curve into SAS algorithm [99] for optimizing the UAV path planning. The effectiveness of Dubins-SAS algorithm was assessed in a 2D environment using 3 obstacles. Experimental results demonstrated that Dubins-SAS outperforms SAS algorithm in terms of planning time and the number of nodes needed to find the optimal path.
In their proposal, Tianzhu et al. [80] suggested an improved A* algorithm for optimizing the UAV path planning in a 3D environment. The performance of the Improved A* algorithm was evaluated in a 3D simulation map using 3 different experiences. In the first one, eight static obstacles and one flying UAV at high altitude were used. In the second one, the number of obstacles was reduced to 2. In the last experience, radar was added to test the behavior of the UAV under dangerous threats. Simulation results showed that improved A* provides better performance compared to ACO and APF in terms of cost-efficiency and path length optimization.
Zhang and Meng [81] developed Sparse A* Search (SAS) algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The effectiveness of SAS algorithm was validated in a 3D environment with the presence of multiple mountains

The performance of BAA* algorithm was validated in a 3D complex environment using 4 static obstacles in 3 different study cases. Simulation results demonstrated that BAA* algorithm outperforms A* and SA* [101] by generating the best path cost with minimum nodes and less execution time.
Zhang et al. [87] proposed an Improved A* algorithm, called Learning Real-Time A-star algorithm (LRTA-Star) based on the combination of Model-based predictive control [102] and A* algorithm for real-time penetration path planning. The performance of LRTA-Star algorithm was assessed in a 3D environment in 3 cases with the presence of 4, 8, and 13 obstacles respectively in each study case. Simulation results showed the robustness of LRTA-Star in comparison with SAS and D* algorithms [103] in terms of time-efficiency and path length optimization.
4.2.2 Bi‑Level Programming Algorithm
In the work of Liu et al. [91], authors proposed an improved Bi-Level Programming (BLP) algorithm based on the integration of multiple optimization strategies into BLP algorithm [104] for solving the real-time UAV path planning problem. The performance of the improved BLP algorithm was evaluated in 10 scenarios inside a 3D complex environment using multiple Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs) as threats. It was demonstrated that BLP algorithm provides better performance compared to A 2d [105], FBCRI[106], MILP [107], and RRT in terms of smooth path length, planning time, and minimum peak error.
Kang et al. [92] proposed BLP algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of BLP algorithm was validated in a 2D environment based on 10 experiences compared to RRT, A*, and PSO. At each experience, the number of obstacles is increased by one starting from one obstacle. Experimental results showed that BLP and RRT algorithms give better performances compared to A* and PSO. BLP is appropriate in complex situations and low variance, while RRT is appropriate in simple cases and large variance.
4.2.3 Greedy Algorithm
Ahmed et al. [93] proposed an Optimal Path Planning (OPP) algorithm based on the hybridization of two variants of greedy algorithm, called, Greedy Least Cost (GLC) and First Detect Fist Reserve (FDFR) to enhance the energy consumption for the UAV path planning. The robustness of OPP algorithm was evaluated in a 3D environment using multiple flying Parrot AR drones. Experimental results demonstrated

that OPP algorithm outperforms original GLC and FDFR heuristics in terms of energy efficiency.
In the work of Silva et al. [94], Greedy heuristic (GH) algorithm was proposed for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of GH algorithm was validated in a 2D environment under critical situations in comparison with GA and Multi-Population GA (MPGA). Experimental results demonstrated that GH outperforms GA and MPGA of path length and execution time.
4.2.4 Others
Fritas et al. [95] proposed Lin–Kernighan heuristic (LKH) algorithm for improving the UAV path planning in biological pest control applications. Authors evaluated LKH algorithm in 3 non-convex areas in comparison with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [108] and Guided Local Search (GLS) [109] algorithms. Experimental results proved that LKH algorithm outperforms ACO and GLS algorithms in terms of path length optimization, cost-efficiency, and time-execution.
In their proposal, De Filippis et al. [96] developed a novel heuristic approach as an extension of A* algorithm, called Theta* algorithm, for optimizing the UAV path planning problem in a 3D environment. The effectiveness of Theta* algorithm was evaluated in both urban and highlands areas with different shapes of obstacles. Compared to A* algorithm, experimental results proved the superiority of Theta* algorithm in terms of path length optimization and constraints handling.
4.2.5 Analysis
Several heuristic algorithms were proposed to overcome the drawbacks of classical approaches and bring some improvements for solving the UAV path planning problem. The strengths and weaknesses of each of them are summarized in Table 11.
A* algorithm is the popular and the most widely used heuristic algorithm for solving the UAV path planning (as shown in Fig. 9). It takes into account the path quality in terms of length and reduces the time complexity of the UAV path planning problem. Moreover, it provides the optimal path with fast convergence. However, this approach presents some weaknesses in handling multi-objective UAV path planning, especially in dynamic environments. To address this issue, BLP approach is applied. It can successfully solve the multi-objective UAV path planning by assigning to each level a single objective. Nevertheless, it is limited in case of multi-UAVs path planning. LKH and GH are two effective heuristic algorithms applied for handling the UAV path planning problem thanks to their simple and easy implementation. Despite that, both algorithms suffer from high

This algorithm did undergo three different scenarios using 2, 4, and 8 UAVs for each scenario, respectively. Simulation results proved the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to ABC [191], ACO [192], ASTS [193], Greedy [194], POMDP [195], PSO-GA [196] , and RHC [197] in terms of time efficiency.

4.3 Meta‑heuristics
Meta-heuristic algorithms are widely used for optimizing the UAV path planning as shown in Fig. 10 and Table 12. They are divided into two main categories: single-based and population-based approaches. In the single-based category, only Tabu Search algorithm [110] was explored on the studied area. However, several approaches from the populationbased category were applied as we can see below.

In their proposal, Brintaki and Nikolos [112] suggested Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) [198] for solving the multi-UAVs path planning problem. The efficiency of DE algorithm was assessed in a maritime environment with the presence of 3 flying UAVs and multiple islands. Simulation results demonstrated that DE algorithm provides an optimal and safe path in a reasonable traveling time.

On the other hand, several classes of population-based meta-heuristics are proposed including evolutionary-based, Swarm-based, physic-based, and human-based. Swarm-based algorithms are the most applied methods in UAV path planning as shown in Fig. 11. They are characterized by their fast convergence and solution generation providing optimal paths in both static and dynamic environments. Human and physicbased algorithms are two other classes of population-based

UAV Path Planning Using Optimization Approaches: A Survey﻿	

Yan and Xiang [230] proposed an enhanced Q-learning algorithm based on the integration of -greedy and Boltzmann approaches into the Q-learning algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of the improved Q-learning algorithm was evaluated in a 2D environment with the presence of 3 circular obstacles. Experimental results demonstrated that the improved Q-learning algorithm provides the shortest path and generates minimum steps to reach the target compared to the original Q-learning technique.
In their proposal, Zhang et al. [231] suggested a novel approach based on the integration of state machine and differential-equation models into Q-learning algorithm for optimizing the QuadRotor UAV path planning. The robustness of the proposed algorithm was validated in a 2D complex environment where the UAV hovered at a fixed height. Simulation results revealed that the proposed algorithm ensures a collision-free path and optimizes the iteration number to join the target point.
In the work of Xie et al. [232], authors developed an improved Q-learning algorithm, called MARER Q-learning, based on the integration of Experience Relay function into the Q-learning algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The effectiveness of MARER Q-learning algorithm was validated in a 3D environment using mountains with different heights as obstacles. Simulation results proved that MARER Q-learning algorithm outperforms the ordinary Q-learning algorithm in terms of path generation, computational cost, and convergence speed.

4.4.5 Analysis
As presented before, several approaches based on machine learning were proposed for UAV path planning. The advantages and disadvantages of each of them are summarized in Table 17.
Neural Network is one of the first machine learning techniques used for solving the UAV path planning problem. It is suitable for dynamic environments and demonstrates its ability to handle multi-objective path planning while providing good solutions with fast convergence. However, it suffers from high computational complexity that increases as long as the complexity of the environment increases. To overcome this issue, the supervised learning algorithm is introduced. It reduces the complexity of the UAV path planning problem and offers better solutions. However, its efficiency is low for large datasets with long processing time. On the other hand, as we can see in Fig. 13 that reinforcement learning-based techniques are the widely used for optimizing the UAV path planning under multiple constraints, especially UAV’s axes. Nevertheless, they are greedy in terms of memory and energy consumption. One of the solutions to deal with that is the use of unsupervised learning-based techniques. In fact, they are more efficient in optimizing the energy consumption in uncertain environments. Though, like all machine learning algorithms, they also suffer from long processing time, especially in real-time path planning.
4.5 Hybrid Approaches

4.4.4 Unsupervised Learning
In the proposal of Pierre et al. [237], authors proposed an improved Kohenen’s Self-Organizing Map (SOM) technique based on the hybridization of competitive learning and particle physics for optimizing the UAV path planning. The performance of the improved SOM algorithm was assessed in a 3D study environment in 3 scenarios. In the first one, one UAV was used in a free area. In the second one, 4 obstacles were distributed randomly on the map. In the last one, 5 obstacles were used with different characteristics. Experimental results demonstrated that the improved SOM can successfully avoid obstacles and overcomes local minimum problems.
Choi et al. [238] presented Two-layer approaches based on clustering and Predictive Control models for optimizing the fixed-wing UAV path planning. The performance of Two-layer approaches was assessed in a 3D environment using 1 aircraft UAV and 3 obstacles. Test results showed that Two-layer approaches provide better results compared to one-layer approach [239] in terms of optimal path, execution time, energy efficiency, and dynamic obstacle avoidance (Table 16).

In addition to the previously defined approaches, some algorithms are based on the hybridization of several methods. In general, several ways of hybridization are possible. However, in the UAV path planning problem, we found only 4 combination types: combining two classical methods, combining a classical approach with heuristic, combining a classical method with meta-heuristic, and combining two meta-heuristics. The concerned approaches are summarized in Fig. 14 and Table 18 below with the specification of the obtained performance.
4.5.1 Classical with Classical Approaches
Authors in [241] proposed a dynamic improved Voronoi Diagram algorithm based on the combination of Voronoi Diagram and Dijkstra algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of the improved Voronoi Diagram algorithm was simulated in a radar threat region of 8x8 Km and results demonstrated that the improved Voronoi Diagram algorithm provides better results in terms of time-efficiency and path optimization.
An Improved RRT-Connect (IRRTC) algorithm was proposed by Zhang et al. [242], which is based on the

Experimental results demonstrated that mVGAv outperforms other variants of GA algorithm existing in the literature [253–255] in terms of computational time and local minimum avoidance (Table 19).
A hybrid technique, called Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA), was introduced by Arantes et al. [256], which is based on the combination of GA and Visibility Graph for solving the UAV path planning problem. The effectiveness of HGA was evaluated in a 2D non-convex environment using static obstacles distributed in 50 maps. Simulation results showed the efficacy of HGA compared to CSA [257] and CPLEX [258] in terms of path length efficiency and running time optimization.
Girija and ashok [259] proposed a novel algorithm, called PSO-APF, based on the combination of PSO and APF algorithms for optimizing the UAV path planning. The effectiveness of PSO-APF algorithm was validated in a 3D dynamic cubic area with complex obstacles and 3 moving UAVs. Test results showed that PSO-APF algorithm outperforms the original PSO algorithm in terms of time-efficiency, path cost optimization, and collision-free path generation.
4.5.4 Meta‑heuristics with Meta‑heuristics
In [260], a hybrid PSO-GA was proposed in an attempt to do real-time UAV path planning problems. The effectiveness of PSO-GA was evaluated in a 3D complex

environment using 18 scenarios with 6 different locations. In the work of Ghambari et al. [261], authors developed a novel approach, called TLBO* based on the combination of Teaching Learning-based Optimization (TLBO) with Genetic Algorithm for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of TLBO* was validated in both 2D and 3D areas with the presence of obstacles randomly distributed. Simulation results showed the superiority of the proposed TLBO* compared to the original TLBO algorithm in terms of best path generation, time efficiency, and collision avoidance.
Authors in [263] proposed a hybrid approach, called Maximum-Minimum Ant Colony Optimization-DE algorithm (MMACO-DE), based on the combination of ACO and DE for solving the multi-UAVs path planning problem in a dynamic environment. The effectiveness of MMACODE algorithm was evaluated in a 3D environment in the case of single UAV and 3 UAVs. Simulation results showed the performance of MMACO-DE compared to the original ACO algorithm in terms of path and cost optimization.
Ge et al. [264] presented a modified Pigeon-Inspired Optimization, called, Pigeon Inspired optimization Fruit fly optimization algorithm (PIOFOA) based on the combination of Pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) and Fruit fly optimization algorithm(FOA) for solving the UAV path planning problem in a 3D dynamic environment. The robustness of PIOFOA algorithm was validated in 3 experiences using six moving obstacles. In another work, Qu et al. [271] proposed a hybrid path planning algorithm (HSGWO-MSOS) based on the hybridization of Simplified GWO with Modified Symbiotic Organism Search for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of HSGWO-MSOS was validated in both 2D and 3D complex environments with 8 static obstacles.
4.5.5 Meta‑heuristics with Machine Learning
Qu et al. [274] hybridized GWO and Reinforcement Learning model for solving the UAV path planning problem. The performance of RLGWO was simulated in 3 case studies inside a 3D area with the presence of 8 static obstacles.The robustness of RLGWO compared to EEGWO [275], GWO [279], IGWO [276], and MGWO [277] in terms of convergence time, path cost computation, and collision avoidance were demonstrated.
4.5.6 Analysis

Fig. 15  Hybrid approaches for UAV path planning

A. Ait Saadi et al.

As previously mentioned, some classical algorithms such as APF and VG are more sensitive to complex obstacles and their effectiveness depends on them. To address this shortcoming, hybridization with other classical approaches that succeeded in face of obstacles as RRT are proposed. This kind of hybridization provides more safety to the UAV by better managing the collisions. As shown in Table 7, Dijkstra algorithm generates the shortest path. To benefit from this advantage, several combinations with other classical algorithms are introduced. These hybridizations offer better quality of the path in terms of length. However, they still require all the information about the environment which takes long processing time. To overcome this lack, hybrid classical approaches with heuristics are proposed. These hybridizations provide optimal paths by reducing the required processing time. However, they are not appropriate for dynamic environments with sudden obstacles. Thus, hybridizing meta-heuristics with classical approaches improves this limitation and can be used in real-time cases. The hybridization of meta-heuristics between them is another way used to further enhance the quality of the provided path and reach the optimal solution. Also, combining meta-heuristics with machine learning reduces the time and cost compared to techniques using only machine learning algorithms.
5 Discussion
From this study, important points can be summarized as follow:
Figures 16, 17 and 18 give respectively a synthesis about the addressed environments, the evaluated metrics as well as the proportions at which the different approaches are used.
We can see that the static environment is the one that is mostly taken into account. This is expected because of the regularity it offers. The use of dynamic and multi-UAVs environments are not negligible either and many propositions consider them.

Fig. 16  Experimented environment of UAV path planning
Regarding the metrics, it seems that in the UAV path planning problem the path quality is more priority than the cost it could generate. In fact, as shown in Fig. 17, the most evaluated measures are path optimization and collision avoidance.
Various approaches were used for solving the UAV path planning problem since 2000. As shown in Fig. 18, 34.3% of them are based on Meta-heuristics, 25.3% used classical techniques, whereas hybrid approaches, machine learning, and heuristics are used in only 14.5% and 13% of cases, respectively. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are given in Table 20 where we can notice the following results:
Several classical approaches were applied for solving the UAV path planning problem such as RRT, VD, APF, VG, Dijkstra, and PRM. The main reason of their success is their easy implementation while giving good results (Path optimization, fast solution generation, and time-efficiency) for static environments with simple obstacles. This makes them suitable

be performed. Heuristics generate a short and safe path for UAV path planning with a reasonable computational time. Heuristics are more optimal in static and simple environments. Nevertheless, they do not respond well in the case of dynamic and complex environments. Moreover, heuristics return generally bad solutions for UAV path planning problem in the case of multi-objective resolutions. To deal with the heuristic limits faced in multi-objective cases, metaheuristics are the alternative which is widely used in UAV path planning. They are known to present many advantages as they are intelligent approaches which makes them appropriate for dynamic and complex environments. In UAV path planning problem, meta-heuristics give good quality solutions (path optimization: length, smoothness, cost, energy, and computational time) for complex and dynamic environments while handling UAV’s constraints. Despite their advantages, meta-heuristics remain not suitable for real-time path planning.
Machine learning algorithms are also appropriate for complex and dynamic environments since they are intelligent approaches and their behavior are near to human one. Although, machine learning algorithms present several advantages, they have some weaknesses. Firstly, the time required for processing is higher, so it is not appropriate for real-time planning. Secondly, high execution time requires high resources consumption which impacts the cost of the applied approach. Thirdly, Machine learning approaches require large datasets of the environment to provide optimal solutions, especially with supervised learning.

and reliable for real-time planning. However, no theoretical guarantee is provided about the optimality of the given solutions due to the presence of constraints. Moreover, classical algorithms require full information about the environment to be performed. They provide poor performance in complex and dynamic environments with different threats and obstacles.
Heuristic algorithms appeared to overcome the drawbacks of classical approaches. They are partially intelligent and require only some information about the environment to

The UAV path planning is an important research issue in the field of aerial robotics and automation which has attracted increasing interest from several academics and researchers. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive review of more than 150 articles related to UAVs path planning approaches published from January 2000 to January 2022. We categorized them into five classes: classical methods, heuristics, meta-heuristics, machine learning, and hybrid algorithms. We highlighted various objectives and constraints on which we provide a comparative analysis. The latter is done according to path length, time efficiency, collision avoidance, and cost efficiency as objectives to satisfy under energy, threats, velocity, altitude, UAV’s axes and the climb/descend angle constraints. We drew a number of discussions showing mainly the most used approaches in each class. This study allowed us to become aware of some new challenges and needs for future research directions in this context, such as:
