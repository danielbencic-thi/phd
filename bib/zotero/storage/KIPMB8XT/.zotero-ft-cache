Chapter 9
Trajectory Planning

In previous chapters we studied mathematical models of robot mechanisms. First of all we were interested in robot kinematics and dynamics. Before applying this knowledge to robot control, we must become familiar with the planning of robot motion. The aim of trajectory planning is to generate the reference inputs to the robot control system, which will ensure that the robot end-effector will follow the desired trajectory.
Robot motion is usually deﬁned in the rectangular world coordinate frame placed in the robot workspace most convenient for the robot task. In the simplest task we only deﬁne the initial and the ﬁnal point of the robot end-effector. The inverse kinematic model is then used to calculate the joint variables corresponding to the desired position of the robot end-effector.

9.1 Interpolation of the Trajectory Between Two Points

When moving between two points, the robot manipulator must be displaced from the initial to the ﬁnal point in a given time interval t f . Often we are not interested in the precise trajectory between the two points. Nevertheless, we must determine the time course of the motion for each joint variable and provide the calculated trajectory to the control input.
The joint variable is either the angle ϑ for the rotational or the displacement d for the translational joint. When considering the interpolation of the trajectory we shall not distinguish between the rotational and translational joints, so that the joint variable will be more generally denoted as q. With industrial manipulators moving between two points we most often select the so called trapezoidal velocity proﬁle. The robot movement starts at t = 0 with constant acceleration, followed by the phase of constant velocity and ﬁnished by the constant deceleration phase (Fig. 9.1).

Fig. 9.1 The time dependence of the joint variables with trapezoidal velocity proﬁle

The resulting trajectory of either the joint angle or displacement consists of the central linear interval, which is started and concluded with a parabolic segment. The initial and ﬁnal velocities of the movement between the two points are zero. The duration of the constant acceleration phase is equal to the interval with the constant deceleration. In both phases the magnitude of the acceleration is q¨c. In this way we deal with a symmetric trajectory, where

(9.1)

The trajectory q(t) must satisfy several constraints in order that the robot joint will move from the initial point qi to the ﬁnal point q f in the required time interval t f . The velocity at the end of the initial parabolic phase must be equal to the constant velocity in the linear phase. The velocity in the ﬁrst phase is obtained from the equation describing the constant acceleration motion

q˙ = q¨ct.

(9.2)

At the end of the ﬁrst phase we have

q˙c = q¨ctc.

(9.4)

where qc represents the value of the joint variable q at the end of the initial parabolic phase (i.e., at the time tc). Until that time the motion with constant acceleration q¨c takes place, so the velocity is determined by Eq. (9.2). The time dependence of the
joint position is obtained by integrating Eq. (9.2)

By inserting Eq. (9.6) into Eq. (9.7) and considering the expression (9.1), we obtain, after rearrangement, the following quadratic equation

q¨ctc2 − q¨ct f tc + q f − qi = 0.

(9.8)

The acceleration q¨c is determined by the selected actuator and the dynamic properties of the robot mechanism. For chosen qi , q f , q¨c, and t f the time interval tc is

In the second phase a linear trajectory must be generated starting in the point (tc, qc),

In this way we obtained analytically the time dependence of the angle or displacement of the rotational or translational joint moving from point to point.

9.2 Interpolation by Use of via Points

In some robot tasks, movements of the end-effector more complex than point to point motions, are necessary. In welding, for example, the curved surfaces of the objects must be followed. Such trajectories can be obtained by deﬁning, besides the initial and the ﬁnal point, also the so called via points through which the robot end-effector must move.
In this chapter we shall analyze the problem, where we wish to interpolate the trajectory through n via points {q1, . . . , qn}, which must be reached by the robot in time intervals {t1, . . . , tn}. The interpolation will be performed with the help of trapezoidal velocity proﬁles. The trajectory will consist of a sequence of linear segments describing the movements between two via points and parabolic segments representing the transitions through the via points. In order to avoid the discontinuity of the ﬁrst derivative at the moment tk, the trajectory q(t) must have a parabolic course in the vicinity of qk. By doing so the second derivative in the point qk (acceleration) remains discontinuous.
The interpolated trajectory, deﬁned as a sequence of linear functions with parabolic transitions through the via points (the transition time tk), is analytically described by the following constraints

q(t) =

a1,k (t − tk ) + a0,k b2,k (t − tk )2 + b1,k (t − tk ) + b0,k

(9.14)

The coefﬁcients a0,k and a1,k determine the linear parts of the trajectory, where k represents the index of the corresponding linear segment. The coefﬁcients b0,k, b1,k and b2,k belong to the parabolic transitions. The index k represents the consecutive number of a parabolic segment.
First, the velocities in the linear segments will be calculated from the given positions and the corresponding time intervals, as shown in Fig. 9.2. We assume that the initial and ﬁnal velocities are equal to zero. In this case we have

(9.15)

Further, we must determine the coefﬁcients of the linear segments a0,k and a1,k. The

coefﬁcient a0,k can be found from the linear function (9.14), by taking into account

the known position at the moment tk, when the robot segment approaches the point

qk

q(tk ) = qk = a1,k (tk − tk ) + a0,k = a0,k ,

(9.16)

therefore

t = tk ⇒ a0,k = qk k = 1, . . . , n − 1 .

(9.17)

The coefﬁcient a1,k can be determined from the time derivative of the linear function

(9.14)

q˙(t) = a1,k .

(9.18)

By considering the given velocities in the time interval tk,k+1, we obtain a1,k = q˙k,k+1 k = 1, . . . , n − 1.

(9.19)

9 Trajectory Planning

In this way the coefﬁcients of the linear segments of the trajectory are determined and we can proceed with the coefﬁcients of the parabolic functions. We shall assume that the transition time is predetermined as tk. If the transition time is not prescribed, the absolute value of the acceleration |q¨k| in the via point must be ﬁrst deﬁned and then the transition time is calculated from the accelerations and velocities before and after the via point. In this case only the sign of the acceleration must be determined by considering the sign of the velocity difference in the via point

q¨k = si gn(q˙k,k+1 − q˙k−1,k )|q¨k |,

(9.20)

where sign(·) means the sign of the expression in the brackets. Given the values of the accelerations in the via points and the velocities before and after the via point, the time of motion through the via point tk is calculated (deceleration and acceleration)

tk

=

q˙k,k+1 − q˙k−1,k q¨k

(9.21)

We shall proceed by calculating the coefﬁcients of the quadratic functions. The

required continuity of the velocity during the transition from the linear into the

parabolic trajectory segment at the instant (tk −

the

we calculate the time derivative of the quadratic function (9.14)

q˙(t) = 2b2,k (t − tk ) + b1,k .

(9.22)

Assuming that the velocity at the instant (tk −

is

q˙k−1,k ,

while

at

(9.27)

By equating (9.26) and (9.27) the coefﬁcient b0,k is determined

b0,k = qk + (q˙k,k+1 − q˙k−1,k )

tk . 8

(9.28)

It can be veriﬁed that the calculated coefﬁcient b0,k ensures also continuity of

position at the instant (tk −

tk 2

).

Such

a

choice

of

the

coefﬁcient

b0,k

prevents

the

joint

trajectory going through point qk. The robot only more or less approaches this point.

The distance of the calculated trajectory from the reference point depends mainly on

the decelerating and accelerating time interval tk, which is predetermined by the required acceleration |q¨k|. The error ek of the calculated trajectory can be estimated by comparing the desired position qk with the actual position q(t) at the instant tk,

which is obtained by inserting tk into the quadratic function (9.14)

ek = qk − q(tk ) = qk − b0,k = −(q˙k,k+1 − q˙k−1,k )

tk . 8

(9.29)

It can be noticed that the error ek equals zero only when the velocities of the linear segments before and after the via points are equal or when the time interval tk is zero, meaning inﬁnite acceleration (which in reality is not possible).
The described approach to the trajectory interpolation has a minor deﬁciency. From Eq. (9.29) it can be observed that, instead of reaching the via point, the robot goes around it. As the initial and ﬁnal trajectory points are also considered as via points, an error is introduced into the trajectory planning. At the starting point of the trajectory, the actual and the desired position differ by the error e1 (Fig. 9.3, the light curve shows the trajectory without correction), arising from Eq. (9.29). The error represents a step in the position signal, which is not desired in robotics. To avoid this abrupt change in position, the ﬁrst and the last trajectory point must be handled separately from the via points.
The required velocities in the starting and the ﬁnal points should be zero. The velocity at the end of the time interval t1 must be equal to the velocity in the ﬁrst

t1 is subtracted in the

denominator, as in the short time interval (the beginning of the parabolic segment in

Fig. 9.3) the position of the robot changes only to a very small extent. By doing so, a

acceleration interval t1 we have

We must determine also the acceleration q¨1 at the starting point of the trajectory. Assuming that its absolute value |q¨1| was predetermined, only the sign must be adequately selected. The choice of the sign will be performed on the basis of the
positional difference. In principle the velocity difference should be taken into account

9.2 Interpolation by Use of via Points

when determining the sign of acceleration, however the initial velocity is zero, and the sign can therefore depend on the difference in positions.

q¨1 = sign(q2 − q1)|q¨1|.

From Eq. (9.31), the time interval t1 is calculated

q¨12(t2 − t1)2 − 2q¨1(q2 − q1) , −q¨1

(9.36)

In Eq. (9.36), the minus sign was selected before the square root, because the time interval t1 must be shorter than (t2 − t1). From Eq. (9.30), the velocity in the linear part of the trajectory can be calculated. As is evident from Fig. 9.3 (the darker curve represents the corrected trajectory), the introduced correction eliminates the error in the initial position.
Similarly, as for the ﬁrst segment, the correction must be calculated also for the last segment between points qn−1 and qn. The velocity in the last linear segment is

The acceleration (deceleration) of the last parabolic segment is determined on the basis of the positional difference
