A Note on Two Problemsin Connexionwith Graphs
by
E.W. DrrKsrRA

We considera points (nodes),someor all pairs of which are connectedby a branch; the length of each branch is given. We restrict ourselvesto the case where at least one path exists between any two nodes. We now consider two problems.

Problem 1. Construct the tree of minimum total length betweenthe n nodes. (A tree is a graph with one and only one path betweenevery two nodes.)
In the course ol the construction that we present here, the branches are subdivided into three sets:
I. the branchesdefinitely assignedto the tree under construction (they will form a subtree);
IL the branchesfrom which the next branch to be added to set I, will be selected;
III. the rernaining branches (rejectedor not yet considered)'
The nodes are subdivided into two sets:
A. the nodesconnectedby the branchesof set I,
B. the remaining nodes (one and only onebranch of set II will lead to each of thesenodes).
We stalt the construction by choosingan arbitrary node as the only member of set A, and by placing all branchesthat end in this node in set II. To start with, set I is empty. From then onwalalswe Pedorm the following two steps repeatedly.

Step1. The shortest branch of set II is removedfrom this set and added to set I. As a result one node is transferredfrom set B to set I .

Slep 2. Considerthe branchesleadingfrom the node,that has just beentransferred to set A, to the nodes that are still in set B. If the branch under consideration is longer than the correspondingbranch in set II, it is rejected; it it is shorter,it replacesthe correspondingbranchin set II, and the latter is rejected.

We then return to step I and repeatthe processuntil setsII and B are empty.
The branchesin set I form the tree required,
The solution given here is to be prelerred to the solution given by J. B. Knusxar [1] and those given by H. LoBERMANand A. WrrNgancER [2]. In their solutions all the possibly ]z(z-l) - branches are first of all sorted accordingto length. Even if the length of the branchesis a computable function of the node coordinates,their methods demandthat data for al1 branchesare stored simultaneously. Our method only requires the simultaneous storing of

the data for at mostr branchesv, iz. the branchesin setsI and II and the bmnch under considerationin step 2.
Problem 2. Find the path of rninimum total lengtl betweentwo given nodes P and Q.
We usethe fact that, if R is a nodeon the minimal path from P to Q,knowledge of the latter implies the knowledge of the minimal path from P to Ä. In the solution presented,the minimal paths from P to the other nodesare constructed in order of increasinglength until Q is reached.
Iu the cou$e of the solution the nodes are subdivided into three sets:
A. the nodesfor wbLichthe path o{ nrinimum lengti from P is known; nodes will be addedto this setin order of increasingminimum path length from nodeP;
B. the nodesfrom which the next node to be addedto set A will be selected; this set comprisesall those nodes that are connectedto at least one node of set A but do not yet belong to A themselves;
C. the remaining nodes.
The branchesare also subdivided into three sets:
L the branchesoccurring in the minimal paths ftom node P to the lodes in setA;
IL the branchesfrom which the oext brancl to be placed in set I will be selected;one and only one branch of this set will lead to eachnodein set B;
III. the remainingbranches(rejectedor not yet considered).
To start with, all nodesare iu set C and all branchesare in set IIL We now transfer node P to set A and from then onwardsrepeatedlyperform the following steps.
Slep7. Considerall branchesz connectingthe node just transfeired to set A with nodesR in setsB or C. If nodeR belongsto setB, we investigatewhether the use of branch z gives rise to a shorter path Jrom P to R than the known path that usesthe correspondingbranch in set II. If this is not so, branch r is rejected; if, however, use of branch z resu.ltsin a shorter connexionbetweenP and .R than hitherto obtaiaed, it replacesthe correspondingbranch in set II and the Latteris rejected.If the node.Rbelongsto setC, it is addedto setB and branch r is added to set II.
SleP2. Elery node in set B can be connectedto node P in only one way if we restrict ourselvesto branchesfrom set I and one from set II. In this sense eachnodein set B hasa distancefrom node P: the nodewith minimum distance from P is transferred from set B to set A, and the correspondingbranch is transferred from set II to set I. We then retum to stepI and repeatthe process until node Q is transferred to set A. Then the solution has been found.
Remark 1. The aboveprocesscan alsobe appliedin the casewherethe length of a branch dependson the direction in which it is traversed.
Remark 2. For eachbranchin sets I and II it is advisableto lecord its two nodes(in order of increasingdistance from P), and the distance betweenP and that nodeof the branchthat is furthest from P. For the branchesof set I this
