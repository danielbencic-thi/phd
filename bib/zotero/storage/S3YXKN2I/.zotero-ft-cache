I. INTRODUCTION
Unmanned vehicles have been developed rapidly. The UAVs got many advanced advantages such as high concealment and mobility [1], [2]. Complex missions such as environmental exploration [3], surveillance [4] and target tracking [5] can be performed with the help of UAVs to provide vision safely [6].
Many efforts are proposed to track moving target using multi-UAVs [7], [8]. In order to coordinate multi-UAVs, communication capabilities such as sensing ability or topological interactions [9], [10] need be promised. Besides,

the information fusion method is utilized to process the information and communication noise [11], [12].
UAVs can also cooperate with ground unit [13]. By using a probabilistic path planning method, UAVs and ground vehicle are utilized to track target in urban environment [14], [15]. In environmental exploration, UAVs need track ground unit and provide vision in the desired formation, while many efforts are proposed to solve this problem using multi-UAVs [16]– [18].
The obstacle avoidance method must be utilized for UAVs when exploring the complex environment. The obstacles avoidance method is combined with the formation control scheme [19], [20]. The model predictive formation control is utilized to guide UAVs avoid collision [22]. The current obstacles avoidance method can be divided into several types: heuristic search based method, optimization algorithm [21], potential ﬁeld and stream function based method. To promise the computational efﬁciency and quality of trajectory in 3D complex environment, an IFDS based method is utilized to guide UAV avoid obstacles smoothly [23], [24]. The IFDS method will not change the stability and general direction of original system, so it is suitable to combined with formation scheme of multi-UAVs.
Multi-UAVs and ground vehicle are utilized to explore a complex environment with obstacles. The UAVs are responsible to provide wider vision for ground vehicle. The detection sensor is mounted on UAV, however the coverage area of

sensor is limited. Then multi-UAVs can form the desired formation around ground vehicle cooperatively to maximizes the total vision area of UAV formation.
The desired formation requires UAVs to be evenly distributed around ground vehicle. The ﬂying height and radial distance from vehicle to UAV are designed under constraints to maximizes the total vision area. The main goal is to let multi-UAVs track the ground vehicle in desired formation and avoid obstacles at same time. Overall, the main contributions can be divided into several parts as follow:
1) The desired UAV formation is proposed to maximizes the total vision area in simple environment. The desired ﬂying height and radial distance are optimized under constraints.
2) The formation control scheme of multi-UAVs is combined with IFDS method when exploring the complex environment. It is updated according to original desired formation and risk of collision.
3) The simulation is ﬁnished with three UAVs and ground vehicle. The results showed that multi-UAVs can maintain the desired formation around ground vehicle and avoid obstacles at same time in complex environment.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the mathematical model of UAVs and ground vehicle. Section 3 gives the desired UAV formation and updated control scheme of multi-UAVs in complex environment. In section 4, the simulation verify the effectiveness of proposed method to guide UAVs avoid collision and maintain the desired formation in complex environment. Lastly, conclusion is given in section 5.

r = h tan γ

(2)

where h is ﬂying height of UAV and γ is the maximum sensor ﬁeld angle. Then the area is expressed as,
SF OV = {(xs, ys) ∈ R2|(xs − xos)2 + (ys − yos)2 ≤ r2} (3)
Location (xs, ys) is inside the area SF OV . The center (xos, yos) coincide with the location (xi, yi).

Fig. 3. Distance between UAV and ground vehicle

A. Optimal formation in simple environment

In the air-ground cooperative exploration, the ground vehicle is responsible for the communication. Then the desired UAV formation must be obtained under the distance constraints between UAV and vehicle for stable communication.
The ﬂying height hi of ith UAV and radial distance dxy,i between UAV and ground vehicle (xG, yG) on xy plane are shown in Fig.3. The dxy,i is given as,

dxy,i

The distance di between ith UAV and ground vehicle PG is constrained for stable communication. The di is given as,

)

1 2

(6)

di ≤ dmax/λ

where dmax is the distance constraint. The dilatation coefﬁcient λ greater than 1 is introduced here.
To maximizes the total vision areas Stotal, UAVs need be distributed evenly around vehicle with same desired dxy,o and height ho. The Stotal increase with the increasing of both dxy,o and ho, however they are both constrained by dmax according to Eq.(6). Then the rate coefﬁcient α = h/dxy is regarded as the optimization parameter in maximization of Stotal.
For example, three UAVs at (P1, P2, P3) are distributed evenly around vehicle PG with different α and same distance d, shown in Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b). Stotal is obtained by overlapping SF OV of each UAV, while (Pa, Pb, Pc) are the intersection points of SF OV . Then Stotal can be divided into equal three S without overlapping. For example, the area S for UAV at P2 consists of triangular area S∆PGP2Pb , S∆PGP2Pa and sector area SPbP2Pa with angle µ. Stotal is given as,

Stotal = 3S

S = 2S1 + S2

where γ is assumed to be 45◦ for computation, then r = h =

αdxy. h and dxy can both be expressed by rate α and d. The maximization of S/d2 is only related to coefﬁcient α, shown

in Fig.5. The relative area S/d2 changes with coefﬁcient α, and
obviously there is a maximum value of S/d2. The optimal
αo can be obtained by deriving the equation or ﬁnding the abscissa of maximum point as,

αo = arg max(S/d2)

B. Formation update scheme in complex environment

The formation control scheme of multi-UAVs is proposed to maintain the original desired formation, while obstacles avoidance method must be utilized and combined with formation scheme in exploration of complex environment. To maintain the original desired formation, the formation scheme is updated according to the need of obstacles avoidance.
To describe the risk of collision in the complex environment, the obstacles or threats are expressed as,

Γl(P )

=

( ) x−xo,l 2px,l
ρx,l

+

( ) y−yo,l 2py,l
ρy,l

+

( ) z−zo,l 2pz,l
ρz,l

Γmin(P ) = min(Γl(P )), (l = 1, 2, ..., L)

(11)

where Γl(P ) is the surface function of lth obstacle in the environment, (l = 1, 2, ..., L). P = (x, y, z) is the position in

the environment. (xo,l, yo,l, zo,l) are center of lth obstacle in three dimensions. Parameter ρl and pl are utilized to describe the size and shape of lth obstacles.

The Γl(P ) represent the relationship between position P and surface of lth obstacle, then it can describe the risk of

collision when UAV at P approaching to lth obstacles. The

Γmin(P ) represents how close the closet obstacle to UAV at P , then it can describe the need of obstacles avoidance

method for UAV at P .

To combine with IFDS method, the formation control

scheme is updated according to original desired ho, dxy,o and Γmin(P ). Then the Eq.(10) is updated as,

zd,i = (ho − zi)(1 − bze−Γmin(Pi)/cz )az + zi

dxy,o

=

((dmax/λ)2

−

zi2

)

1 2

(1

−

bde−Γmin(Pi)/cd )ad

(12)

where zd,i is the updated desired ﬂying height of ith UAV

when UAV at Pi approaching to obstacle. The desired radial

distance dxy,o of ith UAV is updated according to zi and

dmax/λ. dxy,o decreased if zi was raised by IFDS method

to avoid obstacles, thereby di can be still constrained by

dmax/λ.

Then desired location (xd,i, yd,i) of ith UAV on xy plane

are given as,

xd,i yd,i

=

xG yG

− d ei+1+ei−1
xy,o ||ei+1+ei−1||

e = = [ , ] Pxy,i−PG

||Pxy,i −PG ||

dxy,i

dxy,i

(13)

where Pxy,i are location of ith UAV on xy plane. (ei+1,ei−1) represents the relative locations of other two neighbor UAVs for calculating the desired location of ith UAV. It’s no need to distinguish the other two neighbor UAVs.

C. Combination of obstacles avoidance method
The IFDS method is utilized to guide UAVs avoid collision. Compared with traditional method, the biggest advantage of IFDS method is its high computation efﬁciency.
The original velocity vector of UAVs are considered as initial streamlines, while the inﬂuence of static obstacles in environment to the initial streamlines are expressed as a modulation matrix, shown in Fig.6. Then original velocity

vector are modiﬁed by the modulation matrix and regarded as the desired velocity of UAVs. The original general direction of UAV will not be changed by IFDS method.

Fig. 6. Origin streamlines and interfered streamlines in complex 3D environment

The desired position of each UAV Pd,i = [xd,i, yd,i, zd,i]T is obtained according to Eq.(12) and Eq.(13), then desired velocity vector Vd,i of ith UAV is obtained according to position error, given as,

Vd,i

(15)

where Ml(P ) and ωl(P ) are modulation matrix and weight coefﬁcient of lth obstacle. nl(P ) and tl(P ) are normal vector and tangent vector. δl and σl are repulsive and tangential

parameter which represent degree of inﬂuence. The bigger

those two parameters, the earlier UAV will be guided to avoid

obstacle. Besides, δ mainly focus on z direction component

to raise ﬂying height of UAV, so it is mainly considered.

Velocity vector Vd,i is considered as original streamlines of IFDS method. Total modulation matrix M¯ (P ) represents inﬂuence of all obstacles on Vd,i. M¯ (P ) and V¯d,i(P ) are

given as,

where V¯d,i(P ) is regarded as modiﬁed velocity vector of ith UAV at P . To ensure V¯d,i(P ) can still maintain the general direction, V¯d,i(P ) will not be in opposite direction of Vd,i(P ), which is V¯d,i(P ) · Vd,i(P ) > 0. Besides, ||V¯d,i(P )|| = ||Vd,i(P )|| ensure length of velocity vector be less than maximum velocity Vmax.

IV. SIMULATION

(b) di,dxy,i and ﬂying height hi of UAV2

The simulation is conducted with three UAVs and one ground vehicle. The results of simulation can verify the effectiveness of method we proposed by controlling multiUAVs to maintain the desired formation and avoid obstacles in complex environment. It is simulated in MATLAB R2016a on a PC. The total simulation time is 2000 s and the sampling time interval is 0.2 s.

A. Initial conditions and environment

The trajectory of ground vehicle is given as,

xG(t) = 100 + 2t + 100sin(0.001t) yG(t) = −200 + 400sin(0.01t) + 400cos(0.001t)

(17)

The obstacles is assumed to be passable for ground vehicle. The maximum distance between each UAV and ground vehicle are dmax = 200m and dmax/λ = 190m. Multi-UAVs take off at initial positions (150,180,0)m, (100,150,0)m and (50,180,0)m.
The desired ho and dxy,o are obtained according to Eq.(10). γ= 45◦. Then optimal rate coefﬁcient is given as αo ≈ 1.61. ho ≈ 161m and dxy,o ≈ 100m.
The coefﬁcient (az, bz, cz) change the desired ﬂying height zd,i in Eq.(12), which are set to (30,0.1,10). The coefﬁcient (ad, bd, cd) are set to (4,0.1,10 ). In Eq.(14), the coefﬁcient (av, bv, cv) are set to (40,0.1,10). The maximum speed is Vmax = 10m/s. δ and σ are set to (0.5,0.2). The maximum height of obstacles are 180m, UAV would collide with the obstacles if the IFDS method was not used.

B. Results of simulation
In the ﬁrst simulation, the IFDS method is not utilized. The trajectory of multi-UAVs and ground vehicle are shown in Fig.7. Obviously, UAVs collide with obstacles while the desired formation is maintained. The di, dxy,i and hi of multi-UAVs are shown in Fig.8. Height hi of multi-UAVs stay at 161m, and the dxy,i are kept near 100m to maintain the UAV formation.

In the second simulation, the IFDS method is utilized and combined with updated formation control scheme. UAVs can avoid obstacles by raising the ﬂying height hi, while di of multi-UAVs are kept under constraint dmax/λ, shown in Fig.9. In Fig.10(b), the di of second UAV exceeds the constraint dmax/λ for a while, but it is no more than dmax.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the IFDS method will not change the stability of original system and general direction of UAV, which is

suitable for maintaining the original formation. The formation control scheme is designed to eliminate the conﬂict in combination with IFDS method. More kinematic information of neighbor agents can be considered in the design of upper layer of formation control strategy. The controller of UAV can take sliding model control or other advanced algorithm to deal with a more complex system of quadcopter. Next, we can apply this air-ground structure to other applications such as target capturing. Another possible direction is to extend the application on the ﬁxed wing UAV which got kinematic constraints.
