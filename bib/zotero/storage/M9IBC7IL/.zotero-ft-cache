Preface
Manifolds are the mathematical generalizations of curves and surfaces to arbitrary numbers of dimensions. This book is an introduction to the topological properties of manifolds at the beginning graduate level. It contains the essential topological ideas that are needed for the further study of manifolds, particularly in the context of differential geometry, algebraic topology, and related ﬁelds. Its guiding philosophy is to develop these ideas rigorously but economically, with minimal prerequisites and plenty of geometric intuition. Here at the University of Washington, for example, this text is used for the ﬁrst third of a year-long course on the geometry and topology of manifolds; the remaining two-thirds of the course focuses on smooth manifolds using the tools of differential geometry.
There are many superb texts on general and algebraic topology available. Why add another one to the catalog? The answer lies in my particular vision of graduate education: it is my (admittedly biased) belief that every serious student of mathematics needs to be intimately familiar with the basics of manifold theory, in the same way that most students come to know the integers, the real numbers, vector spaces, functions of one real or complex variable, groups, rings, and ﬁelds. Manifolds play a role in nearly every major branch of mathematics (as I illustrate in Chapter 1), and specialists in many ﬁelds ﬁnd themselves using concepts and terminology from topology and manifold theory on a daily basis. Manifolds are thus part of the basic vocabulary of mathematics, and need to be part of basic graduate education. The ﬁrst steps must be topological, and are embodied in this book; in most cases, they should be complemented by material on smooth manifolds, vector ﬁelds, differential forms, and the like, as developed, for example, in [Lee02], which is designed to be a sequel to this book. (After all, few of the really interesting applications of manifold theory are possible without using tools from calculus.)
Of course, it is not realistic to expect all graduate students to take full-year courses in general topology, algebraic topology, and differential geometry. Thus, although this book touches on a generous portion of the material that is typically included in much longer courses, the coverage is selective and relatively concise, so that most of the book can be covered in a single quarter or semester, leaving time in a year-long course for further study in whatever direction best suits the instructor

Preface

and the students. At UW, we follow it with a two-quarter sequence on smooth manifold theory based on [Lee02]; but it could equally well lead into a full-blown course on algebraic topology.
It is easy to describe what this book is not. It is not a course on general topology— many of the topics that are standard in such a course are ignored here, such as metrization theorems, the Tychonoff theorem for inﬁnite product spaces, a comprehensive treatment of separation axioms, and function spaces. Nor is it a course in algebraic topology—although I treat the fundamental group in detail, there is barely a mention of the higher homotopy groups, and the treatment of homology theory is extremely brief, meant mainly to give the ﬂavor of the theory and to lay some groundwork for the later introduction of de Rham cohomology. It certainly is not a comprehensive course on topological manifolds, which would have to include such topics as PL structures and maps, transversality, surgery, Morse theory, intersection theory, cobordism, bundles, characteristic classes, and low-dimensional geometric topology. (Perhaps a more accurate title for the book would have been Introduction to Topology with an Emphasis on Manifolds.) Finally, it is not intended as a reference book, because few of the results are presented in their most general or most complete forms.
Perhaps the best way to summarize what this book is would be to say that it represents, to a good approximation, my conception of the ideal amount of topological knowledge that should be possessed by beginning graduate students who are planning to go on to study smooth manifolds and differential geometry. Experienced mathematicians will probably observe that my choices of material and approach have been inﬂuenced by the fact that I am a differential geometer by training and predilection, not a topologist. Thus I give special emphasis to topics that will be of importance later in the study of smooth manifolds, such as paracompactness, group actions, and degree theory. But despite my prejudices, I have tried to make the book useful as a precursor to algebraic topology courses as well, and it could easily serve as a prerequisite to a more extensive course in homology and homotopy theory.
A textbook writer always has to decide how much detail to spell out, and how much to leave to the reader. It can be a delicate balance. When you dip into this book, you will quickly see that my inclination, especially in the early chapters, is toward writing more detail rather than less. This might not appeal to every reader, but I have chosen this path for a reason. In my experience, most beginning graduate students appreciate seeing many proofs written out in careful detail, so that they can get a clear idea of what goes into a complete proof and what lies behind many of the common “hand-waving” and “standard-argument” moves. There is plenty of opportunity for students to ﬁll in details for themselves—in the exercises and problems—and the proofs in the text tend to become a little more streamlined as the book progresses.
When details are left for the student to ﬁll in, whether as formal exercises or simply as arguments that are not carried out in complete detail in the text, I often try to give some indication about how elaborate the omitted details are. If I characterize some omitted detail as “obvious” or as an “easy exercise,” you should take that as an indication that the proof, once you see how to do it, should require only a few

steps and use only techniques that are probably familiar from other similar proofs, so if you ﬁnd yourself constructing a long and involved argument you are probably missing something. On the other hand, if I label an omitted argument “straightforward,” it might not be short, but it should be possible to carry it out using familiar techniques without requiring new ideas or tricky arguments. In any case, please do not fall into the trap of thinking that just because I declare something to be easy, you should see instantly why it is true; in fact, nothing is easy or obvious when you are ﬁrst learning a subject. Reading mathematics is not a spectator sport, and if you really want to understand the subject you will have to get involved by ﬁlling in some details for yourself.

Prerequisites
The prerequisite for studying this book is, brieﬂy stated, a solid undergraduate degree in mathematics; but this probably deserves some elaboration.
Traditionally, “general topology” has been seen as a separate subject from “algebraic topology,” and most courses in the latter begin with the assumption that the students have already completed a course in the former. However, the sad fact is that for a variety of reasons, many undergraduate mathematics majors in the United States never take a course in general topology. For that reason I have written this book without assuming that the reader has had any exposure to topological spaces.
On the other hand, I do assume several essential prerequisites that are, or should be, included in the background of most mathematics majors.
The most basic prerequisite is a thorough grounding in advanced calculus and elementary linear algebra. Since there are hundreds of books that treat these subjects well, I simply assume familiarity with them, and remind the reader of important facts when necessary. I also assume that the reader is familiar with the terminology and rules of ordinary logic.
The other prerequisites are basic set theory such as what one would encounter in any rigorous undergraduate analysis or algebra course; real analysis at the level of Rudin’s Principles of Mathematical Analysis [Rud76] or Apostol’s Mathematical Analysis [Apo74], including, in particular, an acquaintance with metric spaces and their continuous functions; and group theory at the level of Hungerford’s Abstract Algebra: An Introduction [Hun97] or Herstein’s Abstract Algebra [Her96].
Because it is vitally important that the reader be comfortable with this prerequisite material, in three appendices at the end of the book I have collected a summary of the main points that are used throughout the book, together with a representative collection of exercises. Students can use the exercises to test their knowledge, or to brush up on any aspects of the subject on which they feel their knowledge is shaky. Instructors may wish to assign the appendices as independent reading, and to assign some of the exercises early in the course to help students evaluate their readiness for the material in the main body of the book, and to make sure that everyone starts with the same background. Of course, if you have not studied this material before,

Preface

you cannot hope to learn it from scratch here; but the appendices and their exercises can serve as a reminder of important concepts you may have forgotten, as a way to standardize our notation and terminology, and as a source of references to books where you can look up more of the details to refresh your memory.

Organization
The book is divided into thirteen chapters, which can be grouped into an introduction and ﬁve major substantive sections.
The introduction (Chapter 1) is meant to whet the student’s appetite and create a “big picture” into which the many details can later ﬁt.
The ﬁrst major section, Chapters 2 through 4, is a brief and highly selective introduction to the ideas of general topology: topological spaces; their subspaces, products, disjoint unions, and quotients; and connectedness and compactness. Of course, manifolds are the main examples and are emphasized throughout. These chapters emphasize the ways in which topological spaces differ from the more familiar Euclidean and metric spaces, and carefully develop the machinery that will be needed later, such as quotient maps, local path connectedness, and locally compact Hausdorff spaces.
The second major section, comprising Chapters 5 and 6, explores in detail some of the main examples that motivate the rest of the theory. Chapter 5 introduces cell complexes, which are spaces built up from pieces homeomorphic to Euclidean balls. The focus is CW complexes, which are by far the most important type of cell complexes; besides being a handy tool for analyzing topological spaces and building new ones, they play a central role in algebraic topology, so any effort invested in understanding their topological properties will pay off in the long run. The ﬁrst application of the technology is to prove a classiﬁcation theorem for 1-dimensional manifolds. At the end of the chapter, I brieﬂy introduce simplicial complexes, viewing them as a special class of CW complexes in which all the topology is encoded in combinatorial information. Chapter 6 is devoted to a detailed study of 2-manifolds. After exploring the basic examples of surfaces—the sphere, the torus, the projective plane, and their connected sums—I give a proof of the classiﬁcation theorem for compact surfaces, essentially following the treatment in [Mas77]. The proof is complete except for the triangulation theorem for surfaces, which I state without proof.
The third major section, Chapters 7 through 10, is the core of the book. In it, I give a fairly complete and traditional treatment of the fundamental group. Chapter 7 introduces the deﬁnitions and proves the topological and homotopy invariance of the fundamental group. At the end of the chapter I insert a brief introduction to category theory. Categories are not used in a central way anywhere in the book, but it is natural to introduce them after having proved the topological invariance of the fundamental group, and it is useful for students to begin thinking in categorical terms early. Chapter 8 gives a detailed proof that the fundamental group of the circle is in-

ﬁnite cyclic. Because the circle is the precursor and motivation for the entire theory of covering spaces, I introduce some of the terminology of the latter subject—evenly covered neighborhoods, local sections, lifting—in the special case of the circle, and the proofs here are phrased in such a way that they will apply verbatim to the more general theorems about covering spaces in Chapter 11. Chapter 9 is a brief digression into group theory. Although a basic acquaintance with group theory is an essential prerequisite, most undergraduate algebra courses do not treat free products, free groups, presentations of groups, or free abelian groups, so I develop these subjects from scratch. (The material on free abelian groups is included primarily for use in the treatment of homology in Chapter 13, but some of the results play a role also in classifying the coverings of the torus in Chapter 12.) The last chapter of this section gives the statement and proof of the Seifert–Van Kampen theorem, which expresses the fundamental group of a space in terms of the fundamental groups of appropriate subsets, and describes several applications of the theorem including computation of the fundamental groups of graphs, CW complexes, and surfaces.
The fourth major section consists of two chapters on covering spaces. Chapter 11 deﬁnes covering spaces, develops properties of the monodromy action, and introduces homomorphisms and isomorphisms of covering spaces and the universal covering space. Much of the early development goes rapidly here, because it is parallel to what was done earlier in the concrete case of the circle. Chapter 12 explores the relationship between group actions and covering maps, and uses it to prove the classiﬁcation theorem for coverings: there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of coverings of X and conjugacy classes of subgroups of the fundamental group of X . This is then specialized to proper covering space actions on manifolds, which are the ones that produce quotient spaces that are also manifolds. These ideas are applied to a number of important examples, including classifying coverings of the torus and the lens spaces, and proving that surfaces of higher genus are covered by the hyperbolic disk.
The ﬁfth major section of the book consists of one chapter only, Chapter 13, on homology theory. In order to cover some of the most important applications of homology to manifolds in a reasonable time, I have chosen a “low-tech” approach to the subject. I focus mainly on singular homology because it is the most straightforward generalization of the fundamental group. After deﬁning the homology groups, I prove a few essential properties, including homotopy invariance and the Mayer– Vietoris theorem, with a minimum of homological machinery. Then I introduce just enough about the homology of CW complexes to prove the topological invariance of the Euler characteristic. The last section of the chapter is a brief introduction to cohomology, mainly with ﬁeld coefﬁcients, to serve as background for a treatment of de Rham theory in a later course. In keeping with the overall philosophy of focusing only on what is necessary for a basic understanding of manifolds, I do not even mention relative homology, homology with arbitrary coefﬁcients, simplicial homology, or the axioms for a homology theory.
Although this book grew out of notes designed for a one-quarter graduate course, there is clearly too much material here to cover adequately in ten weeks. It should be possible to cover all or most of it in a semester with well-prepared students.

Preface

The book could even be used for a full-year course, allowing the instructor to adopt a much more leisurely pace, to work out some of the problems in class, and to supplement the book with other material.
Each instructor will have his or her own ideas about what to leave out in order to ﬁt the material into a short course. At the University of Washington, we typically do not cover simplicial complexes, homology, or some of the more involved examples of covering maps. Others may wish to leave out some or all of the material on covering spaces, or the classiﬁcation of surfaces. With students who have had a solid topology course, the ﬁrst four chapters could be skipped or assigned as independent reading.

Exercises and Problems
As is the case with any new mathematical material, and perhaps even more than usual with material like this that is so different from the mathematics most students have seen as undergraduates, it is impossible to learn the subject without getting one’s hands dirty and working out a large number of examples and problems. I have tried to give the reader ample opportunity to do so throughout the book. In every chapter, and especially in the early ones, there are questions labeled as exercises woven into the text. Do not ignore them; without their solutions, the text is incomplete. The reader should take each exercise as a signal to stop reading, pull out a pencil and paper, and work out the answer before proceeding further. The exercises are usually relatively easy, and typically involve proving minor results or working out examples that are essential to the ﬂow of the exposition. Some require techniques that the student probably already knows from prior courses; others ask the student to practice techniques or apply results that have recently been introduced in the text. A few are straightforward but rather long arguments that are more enlightening to work through on one’s own than to read. In the later chapters, fewer things are singled out as exercises, but there are still plenty of omitted details in the text that the student should work out before going on; it is my hope that by the time the student reaches the last few chapters he or she will have developed the habit of stopping and working through most of the details that are not spelled out without having to be told.
At the end of each chapter is a selection of questions labeled as problems. These are, for the most part, harder, longer, and/or deeper than the exercises, and give the student a chance to grapple with more signiﬁcant issues. The results of a number of the problems are used later in the text. There are more problems than most students could do in a quarter or a semester, so the instructor will want to decide which ones are most germane and assign those as homework.
You will notice that there are no solutions to any of the exercises or problems in the back of the book. This is by design: in my experience, if written solutions to problems are available, then most students (even the most conscientious ones) tend to be irresistibly tempted to look at the solutions as soon as they get stuck. But it

Preface

is exactly at that stage of being stuck that the deepest learning occurs. It is all too easy for students to read someone else’s solution and immediately think “Oh, now I understand that,” when in fact they do not understand it nearly as well as they would have if they had struggled through it for themselves. A much more effective strategy for getting unstuck is to talk the problem over with an instructor or a fellow student. Getting suggestions from other people and turning them into an argument of your own are much more useful than reading someone else’s complete and polished proof. If you are studying the book on your own, and cannot ﬁnd any nearby kindred spirits to discuss the problems with, try looking for Internet sites that foster discussions among people studying mathematics, such as math.stackexchange.com.

About the Second Edition
Although the basic structure of the book has changed little since the ﬁrst edition, I have rewritten, rearranged, and (hopefully) improved the text in thousands of small ways and a few large ones; there is hardly a page that has not been touched in one way or another. In some places, I have streamlined arguments and eliminated unnecessary verbiage; in others, I have expanded arguments that were insufﬁciently clear in the original.
The change that is most noticeable is in Chapter 5: I have eliminated most of the material on simplicial complexes, and replaced it with an introduction to CW complexes. I have come to believe that, totally apart from their central role in homotopy theory, CW complexes are wonderful tools for constructing and analyzing topological spaces in general and manifolds in particular, due to their extreme ﬂexibility and the ease of doing explicit computations with them. Besides, they have the added virtue of giving an early introduction to one of the most important tools of algebraic topology. This change has ramiﬁcations throughout the rest of the book, especially in Chapter 10, where the computation of fundamental groups of surfaces is streamlined by considering them as special cases of CW complexes, and in Chapter 13, where the exposition of simplicial homology has been replaced by a much simpler treatment of homology properties of CW complexes.
Apart from the addition of CW complexes, the main substantive changes are expanded treatments of manifolds with boundary, local compactness, group actions, and proper maps; and a new section on paracompactness. I have also reworked the treatment of covering maps in Chapters 11 and 12 in order to use the monodromy action to simplify and unify the classiﬁcation of coverings (I am indebted to Steve Mitchell for suggesting this). And, of course, I have corrected all the errors in the ﬁrst edition that I know about. I hope that all of the changes will make the book more useful for future topologists and geometers alike.
There are also a few typographical improvements in this edition. Most important, ofﬁcial deﬁnitions of mathematical terms are now typeset in bold italics; this reﬂects the fact that they are just as important as the theorems and proofs and need to be easy to ﬁnd, but they ﬁt better into the ﬂow of paragraphs rather than being called out with

xii

Preface

special headings. In addition, the exercises in the text are now indicated more clearly with a special symbol (I), and numbered consecutively with the theorems to make them easier to ﬁnd. There also is a new notation index just before the subject index.
Although I have tried hard to ﬁnd and eradicate mistakes in this edition, sad experience teaches that there will probably be plenty of errors left in the ﬁnal version of the book. For the sake of future readers, I hope every reader will take the time to keep notes of any mistakes or passages that are awkward or unclear, and let me know about them as soon as it is convenient for you. I will keep an up-to-date list of corrections on my website, whose address is listed below.

Acknowledgments
Those of my colleagues with whom I have discussed this material—Judith Arms, Ethan Devinatz, Tom Duchamp, Steve Mitchell, and Scott Osborne here at UW, and Tracy Payne at Idaho State—have provided invaluable help in sorting out what should go into this book and how it should be presented. Each has had a strong inﬂuence on the way the book has come out, for which I am deeply grateful. (On the other hand, it is likely that none of them would wholeheartedly endorse all my choices regarding which topics to treat and how to treat them, so they are not to be blamed for any awkwardnesses that remain.) The students at the University of Washington who have used the book have also been especially thoughtful and generous with their suggestions.
I would particularly like to thank Ethan Devinatz for having had the courage to use a draft ﬁrst edition of the book as a course text when it was still in an inchoate state, and for having the grace and patience to wait while I prepared chapters at the last minute for his course. And most of all, I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Judith Arms, who has taught several times from various editions of this book, and has given me more good suggestions than everyone else put together. To whatever extent this edition of the book is an improvement over its predecessor, it is due in very large part to her thoughtful assistance.
Beyond those who have helped in person, there are the countless readers all over the world who have sent me their suggestions and corrections over the Internet. I hope each of them will be able to see the ways in which their contributions have improved the book.
Thanks are due also to Mary Sheetz, who did an excellent job producing some of the illustrations for the ﬁrst edition of the book under the pressures of time and a ﬁnicky author.
My debt to the authors of several other textbooks will be obvious to anyone who knows those books: Allan Hatcher’s Algebraic Topology [Hat02], James Munkres’s Topology [Mun00] and Elements of Algebraic Topology [Mun84], William Massey’s Algebraic Topology: An Introduction [Mas77], Allan Sieradski’s An Introduction to Topology and Homotopy [Sie92], and Glen Bredon’s Topology and Geometry [Bre93] are foremost among them.

Finally, I would like to thank my family once again for their support and patience. Revising a book turns out to take just about as big a toll on personal time as writing one from scratch, and my wife and sons have been ever generous.

Chapter 1
Introduction

A course on manifolds differs from most other introductory graduate mathematics courses in that the subject matter is often completely unfamiliar. Most beginning graduate students have had undergraduate courses in algebra and analysis, so that graduate courses in those areas are continuations of subjects they have already begun to study. But it is possible to get through an entire undergraduate mathematics education, at least in the United States, without ever hearing the word “manifold.”
One reason for this anomaly is that even the deﬁnition of manifolds involves rather a large number of technical details. For example, in this book the formal definition does not come until the end of Chapter 2. Since it is disconcerting to embark on such an adventure without even knowing what it is about, we devote this introductory chapter to a nonrigorous deﬁnition of manifolds, an informal exploration of some examples, and a consideration of where and why they arise in various branches of mathematics.

What Are Manifolds?
Let us begin by describing informally how one should think about manifolds. The underlying idea is that manifolds are like curves and surfaces, except, perhaps, that they might be of higher dimension. Every manifold comes with a speciﬁc nonnegative integer called its dimension, which is, roughly speaking, the number of independent numbers (or “parameters”) needed to specify a point. The prototype of an n-dimensional manifold is n-dimensional Euclidean space R n, in which each point literally is an n-tuple of real numbers.
An n-dimensional manifold is an object modeled locally on R n; this means that it takes exactly n numbers to specify a point, at least if we do not stray too far from a given starting point. A physicist would say that an n-dimensional manifold is an object with n degrees of freedom.
Manifolds of dimension 1 are just lines and curves. The simplest example is the real line; other examples are provided by familiar plane curves such as circles,

parabolas, or the graph of any continuous function of the form y D f .x/ (Fig. 1.1). Still other familiar 1-dimensional manifolds are space curves, which are often described parametrically by equations such as .x; y; z/ D .f .t/; g.t/; h.t// for some continuous functions f; g; h (Fig. 1.2).
In each of these examples, a point can be unambiguously speciﬁed by a single real number. For example, a point on the real line is a real number. We might identify a point on the circle by its angle, a point on a graph by its x-coordinate, and a point on a parametrized curve by its parameter t. Note that although a parameter value determines a point, different parameter values may correspond to the same point, as in the case of angles on the circle. But in every case, as long as we stay close to some initial point, there is a one-to-one correspondence between nearby real numbers and nearby points on the line or curve.
Manifolds of dimension 2 are surfaces. The most common examples are planes and spheres. (When mathematicians speak of a sphere, we invariably mean a spherical surface, not a solid ball. The familiar unit sphere in R3 is 2-dimensional, whereas the solid ball is 3-dimensional.) Other familiar surfaces include cylinders, ellipsoids, paraboloids, hyperboloids, and the torus, which can be visualized as a doughnutshaped surface in R3 obtained by revolving a circle around the z-axis (Fig. 1.3).
In these cases two coordinates are needed to determine a point. For example, on a plane we typically use Cartesian or polar coordinates; on a sphere we might use latitude and longitude; and on a torus we might use two angles. As in the 1dimensional case, the correspondence between points and pairs of numbers is in general only local.

The only higher-dimensional manifold that we can easily visualize is Euclidean
3-space (or parts of it). But it is not hard to construct subsets of higher-dimensional
Euclidean spaces that might reasonably be called manifolds. First, any open subset of Rn is an n-manifold for obvious reasons. More interesting examples are obtained by using one or more equations to “cut out” lower-dimensional subsets. For example, the set of points .x1; x2; x3; x4/ in R4 satisfying the equation

.x1/2 C .x2/2 C .x3/2 C .x4/2 D 1

(1.1)

is called the (unit) 3-sphere. It is a 3-dimensional manifold because in a neigh-
borhood of any given point it takes exactly three coordinates to specify a nearby
point: starting at, say, the “north pole” .0; 0; 0; 1/, we can solve equation (1.1) for x 4, and then each nearby point is uniquely determined by choosing appropriate (small) .x1; x2; x3/ coordinates and setting x4 D .1 .x1/2 .x2/2 .x3/2/1=2. Near other points, we may need to solve for different variables, but in each case three coordi-
nates sufﬁce.
The key feature of these examples is that an n-dimensional manifold “looks like” Rn locally. To make sense of the intuitive notion of “looks like,” we say that two subsets of Euclidean spaces U Â Rk, V Â Rn are topologically equivalent or homeomorphic (from the Greek for “similar form”) if there exists a one-to-one correspondence ' W U ! V such that both ' and its inverse are continuous maps. (Such
a correspondence is called a homeomorphism.) Let us say that a subset M of some Euclidean space Rk is locally Euclidean of dimension n if every point of M has a neighborhood in M that is topologically equivalent to a ball in R n.
Now we can give a provisional deﬁnition of manifolds. We can think of an n-
dimensional manifold (n-manifold for short) as a subset of some Euclidean space Rk that is locally Euclidean of dimension n. Later, after we have developed more machinery, we will give a considerably more general deﬁnition; but this one will get
us started.

Why Study Manifolds?
What follows is an incomplete survey of some of the ﬁelds of mathematics in which manifolds play an important role. This is not an overview of what we will be discussing in this book; to treat all of these topics adequately would take at least a dozen books of this size. Rather, think of this section as a glimpse at the vista that awaits you once you’ve learned to handle the basic tools of the trade.
Topology
Roughly speaking, topology is the branch of mathematics that is concerned with properties of sets that are unchanged by “continuous deformations.” Somewhat more accurately, a topological property is one that is preserved by homeomorphisms.
The subject in its modern form was invented near the end of the nineteenth century by the French mathematician Henri Poincare´, as an outgrowth of his attempts to classify geometric objects that appear in analysis. In a seminal 1895 paper titled Analysis Situs (the old name for topology, Latin for “analysis of position”) and a series of ﬁve companion papers published over the next decade, Poincare´ laid out the main problems of topology and introduced an astonishing array of new ideas for solving them. As you read this book, you will see that his name is written all over the subject. In the intervening century, topology has taken on the role of providing the foundations for just about every branch of mathematics that has any use for a concept of “space.” (An excellent historical account of the ﬁrst six decades of the subject can be found in [Die89].)
Here is a simple but telling example of the kind of problem that topological tools are needed to solve. Consider two surfaces in space: a sphere and a cube. It should not be hard to convince yourself that the cube can be continuously deformed into the sphere without tearing or collapsing it. It is not much harder to come up with an explicit formula for a homeomorphism between them (as we will do in Chapter 2). Similarly, with a little more work, you should be able to see how the surface of a doughnut can be continuously deformed into the surface of a one-handled coffee cup, by stretching out one half of the doughnut to become the cup, and shrinking the other half to become the handle (Fig. 1.4). Once you decide on an explicit set

of equations to deﬁne a “coffee-cup surface” in R 3, you could in principle come up with a set of formulas to describe a homeomorphism between it and a torus. On the other hand, a little reﬂection will probably convince you that there is no homeomorphism from a sphere to a torus: any such map would have to tear open a “hole” in the sphere, and thus could not be continuous.
It is usually relatively straightforward (though not always easy!) to prove that two manifolds are topologically equivalent once you have convinced yourself intuitively that they are: just write down an explicit homeomorphism between them. What is much harder is to prove that two manifolds are not homeomorphic—even when it seems “obvious” that they are not as in the case of a sphere and a torus—because you would need to show that no one, no matter how clever, could ﬁnd such a map.
History abounds with examples of operations that mathematicians long believed to be impossible, only to be proved wrong. Here is an example from topology. Imagine a spherical surface colored white on the outside and gray on the inside, and imagine that it can move freely in space, including passing freely through itself. Under these conditions you could turn the sphere inside out by continuously deforming it, so that the gray side ends up facing out, but it seems obvious that in so doing you would have to introduce a crease somewhere. (It is possible to give precise mathematical deﬁnitions of what we mean by “continuously deforming” and “creases,” but you do not need to know them to get the general idea.) The simplest way to proceed would be to push the northern hemisphere down and the southern hemisphere up, allowing them to pass through each other, until the two hemispheres had switched places (Fig. 1.5); but this would introduce a crease along the equator. The topologist Stephen Smale stunned the mathematical community in 1958 [Sma58] when he proved it was possible to turn the sphere inside out without introducing any creases. Several ways to do this are beautifully illustrated in video recordings [Max77, LMM95, SFL98].
The usual way to prove that two manifolds are not topologically equivalent is by ﬁnding topological invariants: properties (which could be numbers or other mathematical objects such as groups, matrices, polynomials, or vector spaces) that are preserved by homeomorphisms. If two manifolds have different invariants, they cannot be homeomorphic.
It is evident from the examples above that geometric properties such as circumference and area are not topological invariants, because they are not generally pre-

1 Introduction

served by homeomorphisms. Intuitively, the property that distinguishes a sphere from a torus is the fact that the latter has a “hole,” while the former does not. But it turns out that giving a precise deﬁnition of what is meant by a hole takes rather a lot of work.
One invariant that is commonly used to detect holes in a manifold is called the fundamental group of the manifold, which is a group (in the algebraic sense) attached to each manifold in such a way that homeomorphic manifolds have isomorphic fundamental groups. Different elements of the fundamental group represent inequivalent ways that a “loop,” or continuous closed path, can be drawn in the manifold, with two loops considered equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other while remaining in the manifold. The number of such inequivalent loops—in some sense, the “size” of the fundamental group—is one measure of the number of holes possessed by the manifold. A manifold in which every loop can be continuously shrunk to a single point has the trivial (one-element) group as its fundamental group; such a manifold is said to be simply connected. For example, a sphere is simply connected, but a torus is not. We will prove this rigorously in Chapter 8; but you can probably convince yourself intuitively that this is the case if you imagine stretching a rubber band around part of each surface and seeing if it can shrink itself to a point. On the sphere, no matter where you place the rubber band initially, it can always shrink down to a single point while remaining on the surface. But on the surface of a doughnut, there are at least two places to place the rubber band so that it cannot be shrunk to a point without leaving the surface (one goes around the hole in the middle of the doughnut, and the other goes around the part that would be solid if it were a real doughnut).
The study of the fundamental group occupies a major portion of this book. It is the starting point for algebraic topology, which is the subject that studies topological properties of manifolds (or other geometric objects) by attaching algebraic structures such as groups and rings to them in a topologically invariant way.
One of the most important problems of topology is the search for a classiﬁcation of manifolds up to topological equivalence. Ideally, for each dimension n, one would like to produce a list of n-dimensional manifolds, and a theorem that says every n-dimensional manifold is homeomorphic to exactly one on the list. The theorem would be even better if it came with a list of computable topological invariants that could be used to decide where on the list any given manifold belongs. To make the problem more tractable, it is common to restrict attention to compact manifolds, which can be thought of as those that are homeomorphic to closed and bounded subsets of some Euclidean space.
Precisely such a classiﬁcation theorem is known for 2-manifolds. The ﬁrst part of the theorem says that every compact 2-manifold is homeomorphic to one of the following: a sphere, or a doughnut surface with n 1 holes, or a connected sum of n 1 projective planes. The second part says that no two manifolds on this list are homeomorphic to each other. We will deﬁne these terms and prove the ﬁrst part of the theorem in Chapter 6, and in Chapter 10 we will use the technology provided by the fundamental group to prove the second part.

For higher-dimensional manifolds, the situation is much more complicated. The most delicate classiﬁcation problem is that for compact 3-manifolds. It was already known to Poincare´ that the 3-sphere is simply connected (we will prove this in Chapter 7), a property that distinguished it from all other examples of compact 3manifolds known in his time. In the last of his ﬁve companion papers to Analysis Situs, Poincare´ asked if it were possible to ﬁnd a compact 3-manifold that is simply connected and yet not homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. Nobody ever found one, and the conjecture that every simply connected compact 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere became known as the Poincare´ conjecture. For a long time, topologists thought of this as the simplest ﬁrst step in a potential classiﬁcation of 3-manifolds, but it resisted proof for a century, even as analogous conjectures were made and proved in higher dimensions (for 5-manifolds and higher by Stephen Smale in 1961 [Sma61], and for 4-manifolds by Michael Freedman in 1982 [Fre82]).
The intractability of the original 3-dimensional Poincare´ conjecture led to its being acknowledged as the most important topological problem of the twentieth century, and many strategies were introduced for proving it. Surprisingly, the strategy that eventually succeeded involved techniques from differential geometry and partial differential equations, not just from topology. These techniques require far more groundwork than we are able to cover in this book, so we are not able to treat them here. But because of the signiﬁcance of the Poincare´ conjecture in the general theory of topological manifolds, it is worth saying a little more about its solution.
A major leap forward in our understanding of 3-manifolds occurred in the 1970s, when William Thurston formulated a much more powerful conjecture, now known as the Thurston geometrization conjecture. Thurston conjectured that every compact 3-manifold has a “geometric decomposition,” meaning that it can be cut along certain surfaces into ﬁnitely many pieces, each of which admits one of eight highly uniform (but mostly non-Euclidean) geometric structures. Since the manifolds with geometric structures are much better understood, the geometrization conjecture gives a nearly complete classiﬁcation of 3-manifolds (but not yet complete, because there are still open questions about how many manifolds with certain non-Euclidean geometric structures exist). In particular, since the only compact, simply connected 3-manifold with a geometric decomposition is the 3-sphere, the geometrization conjecture implies the Poincare´ conjecture.
The most important advance came in the 1980s, when Richard Hamilton introduced a tool called the Ricci ﬂow for proving the existence of geometric decompositions. This is a partial differential equation that starts with an arbitrary geometric structure on a manifold and forces it to evolve in a way that tends to make its geometry increasingly uniform as time progresses, except in certain places where the curvature grows without bound. Hamilton proposed to use the places where the curvature becomes very large during the ﬂow as a guide to where to cut the manifold, and then try to prove that the ﬂow approaches one of the eight uniform geometries on each of the remaining pieces after the cuts are made. Hamilton made signiﬁcant progress in implementing his program, but the technical details were formidable, requiring deep insights from topology, geometry, and partial differential equations.

1 Introduction

In 2003, Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman ﬁgured out how to overcome the remaining technical obstacles in Hamilton’s program, and completed the proof of the geometrization conjecture and thus the Poincare´ conjecture. Thus the greatest challenge of twentieth century topology has been solved, paving the way for a much deeper understanding of 3-manifolds. Perelman’s proof of the Poincare´ conjecture is described in detail in the book [MT07].
In dimensions 4 and higher, there is no hope for a complete classiﬁcation: it was proved in 1958 by A. A. Markov that there is no algorithm for classifying manifolds of dimension greater than 3 (see [Sti93]). Nonetheless, there is much that can be said using sophisticated combinations of techniques from algebraic topology, differential geometry, partial differential equations, and algebraic geometry, and spectacular progress was made in the last half of the twentieth century in understanding the variety of manifolds that exist. The topology of 4-manifolds, in particular, is currently a highly active ﬁeld of research.

Vector Analysis
One place where you have already seen some examples of manifolds is in elementary vector analysis: the study of vector ﬁelds, line integrals, surface integrals, and vector operators such as the divergence, gradient, and curl. A line integral is, in essence, an integral over a 1-manifold, and a surface integral is an integral over a 2-manifold. The tools and theorems of vector analysis lie at the heart of the classical Maxwell theory of electromagnetism, for example.
Even in elementary treatments of vector analysis, topological properties play a role. You probably learned that if a vector ﬁeld is the gradient of a function on some open domain in R3, then its curl is identically zero. For certain domains, such as rectangular solids, the converse is true: every vector ﬁeld whose curl is identically zero is the gradient of a functiopn. But there are some domains for which this is not the case. For example, if r D x2 C y2 denotes the distance from the z-axis, the vector ﬁeld whose component functions are . y=r 2; x=r2; 0/ is deﬁned everywhere in the domain D consisting of R3 with the z-axis removed, and has zero curl. It would be the gradient of the polar angle function Â D tan 1.y=x/, except that there is no way to deﬁne the angle function continuously on all of D.
The question of whether every curl-free vector ﬁeld is a gradient can be rephrased in such a way that it makes sense on a manifold of any dimension, provided the manifold is sufﬁciently “smooth” that one can take derivatives. The answer to the question, surprisingly, turns out to be a purely topological one. If the manifold is simply connected, the answer is yes, but in general simple connectivity is not necessary. The precise criterion that works for manifolds in all dimensions involves the concept of homology (or rather, its closely related cousin cohomology), which is an alternative way of measuring “holes” in a manifold. We give a brief introduction to homology and cohomology in Chapter 13 of this book; a more thorough treatment of the relationship between gradients and topology can be found in [Lee02].

Geometry

The principal objects of study in Euclidean plane geometry, as you encountered it in secondary school, are ﬁgures constructed from portions of lines, circles, and other curves—in other words, 1-manifolds. Similarly, solid geometry is concerned with ﬁgures made from portions of planes, spheres, and other 2-manifolds. The properties that are of interest are those that are invariant under rigid motions. These include simple properties such as lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, as well as more sophisticated properties derived from them such as curvature. The curvature of a curve or surface is a quantitative measure of how it bends and in what directions; for example, a positively curved surface is “bowl-shaped,” whereas a negatively curved one is “saddle-shaped.”
Geometric theorems involving curves and surfaces range from the trivial to the very deep. A typical theorem you have undoubtedly seen before is the angle-sum theorem: the sum of the interior angles of any Euclidean triangle is radians. This seemingly trivial result has profound generalizations to the study of curved surfaces, where angles may add up to more or less than depending on the curvature of the surface. The high point of surface theory is the Gauss–Bonnet theorem: for a closed, bounded surface in R3, this theorem expresses the relationship between the total curvature (i.e., the integral of curvature with respect to area) and the number of holes the surface has. If the surface is topologically equivalent to an n-holed doughnut surface, the theorem says that the total curvature is exactly equal to 4 4 n. In the case n D 1 this implies that no matter how a one-holed doughnut surface is bent or stretched, the regions of positive and negative curvature will always precisely cancel each other out so that the total curvature is zero.
The introduction of manifolds has allowed the study of geometry to be carried into higher dimensions. The appropriate setting for studying geometric properties in arbitrary dimensions is that of Riemannian manifolds, which are manifolds on which there is a rule for measuring distances and angles, subject to certain natural restrictions to ensure that these quantities behave analogously to their Euclidean counterparts. The properties of interest are those that are invariant under isometries, or distance-preserving homeomorphisms. For example, one can study the relationship between the curvature of an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (a local property) and its global topological type. A typical theorem is that a complete Riemannian n-manifold whose curvature is everywhere larger than some ﬁxed positive number must be compact and have a ﬁnite fundamental group (not too many holes). The search for such relationships is one of the principal activities in Riemannian geometry, a thriving ﬁeld of contemporary research. See Chapter 1 of [Lee97] for an informal introduction to the subject.

Algebra

1 Introduction

One of the most important objects studied in abstract algebra is the general linear group GL.n; R/, which is the group of n n invertible real matrices, with matrix multiplication as the group operation. As a set, it can be identiﬁed with a subset of n2-dimensional Euclidean space, simply by stringing all the matrix entries out in a row. Since a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero, GL.n; R/ is an open subset of Rn2, and is therefore an n2-dimensional manifold. Similarly, the complex general linear group GL.n; C/ is the group of n n invertible complex matrices; it is a 2n2-manifold, because we can identify C n2 with R2n2 .
A Lie group is a group (in the algebraic sense) that is also a manifold, together with some technical conditions to ensure that the group structure and the manifold structure are compatible with each other. They play central roles in differential geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics, among many other ﬁelds. The most important Lie groups are subgroups of the real and complex general linear groups. Some commonly encountered examples are the special linear group SL.n; R/ Â GL.n; R/, consisting of matrices with determinant 1; the orthogonal group O.n/ Â GL.n; R/, consisting of matrices whose columns are orthonormal; the special orthogonal group SO.n/ D O.n/ \ SL.n; R/; and their complex analogues, the complex special linear group SL.n; C/ Â GL.n; C/, the unitary group U.n/ Â GL.n; C/, and the special unitary group SU.n/ D U.n/ \ SL.n; C/.
It is important to understand the topological structure of a Lie group and how its topological structure relates to its algebraic structure. For example, it can be shown that SO.2/ is topologically equivalent to a circle, SU.2/ is topologically equivalent to the 3-sphere, and any connected abelian Lie group is topologically equivalent to a Cartesian product of circles and lines. Lie groups provide a rich source of examples of manifolds in all dimensions.

Complex Analysis
Complex analysis is the study of holomorphic (i.e., complex analytic) functions. If f is any complex-valued function of a complex variable, its graph is a subset of C2 D C C, namely f.z; w/ W w D f .z/g. More generally, the graph of a holomorphic function of n complex variables is a subset of C n C D CnC1. Because the set C of complex numbers is naturally identiﬁed with R2, and therefore the ndimensional complex Euclidean space C n can be identiﬁed with R2n, we can consider graphs of holomorphic functions as manifolds, just as we do for real-valued functions.
Some holomorphic functions are naturally “multiple-valued.” A typical example is the complex square root. Except for zero, every complex number has two distinct square roots. But unlike the case of positive real numbers, where we canpalways unambiguously choose the positive square root to denote by the symbol x, it is

C i sin Â/. Then the As Â increases from

0 to 2 , the ﬁrst square root goes from the positive real axis through the upper half-

plane to the negative real axis, while the second goes from the negative real axis

through the lower half-plane to the positive real axis. Thus whichever continuous

square root function we start with on the positive real axis, we are forced to choose

the other after having made one circuit around the origin.

Even though a “two-valued function” is properly considered as a relation and

not really a function at all, we can make sense of the graph of such a relation in

an unambiguous way. To warm up with a simpler example, consider the two-valued

square root set of pairs

“function” .x; u/ 2 R

on the nonnegative repal axis. Its graph is R such that u D ˙ x, or equivalently

deﬁned to be u2 D x. This

the is a

parabola opening in the positive x direction (Fig. 1.6), which we can think of as the

two “branches” of the square root.

Similarly, the graph of the two-valued complex square root “function” is the set

of pairs .z; w/ 2 C2 such that w2 D z. Over each small disk U Â C that does not

contain 0, this graph has two branches or “sheets,” corresponding to the two possible

continuous choices of square root function on U (Fig. 1.7). If you start on one sheet

above the positive real axis and pass once around the origin in the counterclockwise

direction, you end up on the other sheet. Going around once more brings you back

to the ﬁrst sheet.

It turns out that this graph in C 2 is a 2-dimensional manifold, of a special type

called a Riemann surface: this is essentially a 2-manifold on which there is some

way to deﬁne holomorphic functions. Riemann surfaces are of great importance in

complex analysis, because any holomorphic function gives rise to a Riemann surface

by a procedure analogous to the one we sketched above. The surface we constructed

turns out to be topologically equivalent to a plane, but more complicated functions

can give ripse to more complicated surfaces. For example, the two-valued “function” f .z/ D ˙ z3 z yields a Riemann surface that is homeomorphic to a plane with

one “handle” attached.

One of the fundamental tasks of complex analysis is to understand the topological type (number of “holes” or “handles”) of the Riemann surface of a given function, and how it relates to the analytic properties of the function.

Algebraic Geometry
Algebraic geometers study the geometric and topological properties of solution sets to systems of polynomial equations. Many of the basic questions of algebraic geometry can be posed very naturally in the elementary context of plane curves deﬁned by polynomial equations. For example: How many intersection points can one expect between two plane curves deﬁned by polynomials of degrees k and l? (Not more than kl, but sometimes fewer.) How many disconnected “pieces” does the solution set to a particular polynomial equation have (Fig. 1.8)? Does a plane curve have any self-crossings (Fig. 1.9) or “cusps” (points where the tangent vector does not vary continuously—Fig. 1.10)?
But the real power of algebraic geometry becomes evident only when one focuses on polynomials with coefﬁcients in an algebraically closed ﬁeld (one in which every polynomial decomposes into a product of linear factors), because polynomial equations always have the expected number of solutions (counted with multiplicity) in that case. The most extensively studied case is the complex ﬁeld; in this context the solution set to a system of complex polynomials in n variables is a certain geometric object in Cn called an algebraic variety, which (except for a small subset where there might be self-crossings or more complicated kinds of behavior) is a manifold. The subject becomes even more interesting if one enlarges C n by adding “ideal points at inﬁnity” where parallel lines or asymptotic curves can be thought of

as meeting; the resulting set is called complex projective space, and is an extremely important manifold in its own right.
The properties of interest are those that are invariant under projective transformations (the natural changes of coordinates on projective space). One can ask such questions as these: Is a given variety a manifold, or does it have singular points (points where it fails to be a manifold)? If it is a manifold, what is its topological type? If it is not a manifold, what is the topological structure of its singular set, and how does that set change when one varies the coefﬁcients of the polynomials slightly? If two varieties are homeomorphic, are they equivalent under a projective transformation? How many times and in what way do two or more varieties intersect?
Algebraic geometry has contributed a prodigious supply of examples of manifolds. In particular, much of the recent progress in understanding 4-dimensional manifolds has been driven by the wealth of examples that arise as algebraic varieties.

Computer Graphics

1 Introduction

The job of a computer graphics program is to generate realistic images of 3dimensional objects, for such applications as movies, simulators, industrial design, and computer games. The surfaces of the objects being modeled are usually represented as 2-dimensional manifolds.
A surface for which a simple equation is known—a sphere, for example—is easy to model on a computer. But there is no single equation that describes the surface of an airplane or a dinosaur. Thus computer graphics designers typically create models of surfaces by specifying multiple coordinate patches, each of which represents a small region homeomorphic to a subset of R2. Such regions can be described by simple polynomial functions, called splines, and the program can ensure that the various splines ﬁt together to create an appropriate global surface. Analyzing the tangent plane at each point of a surface is important for understanding how light reﬂects and scatters from the surface; and analyzing the curvature is important to ensure that adjacent splines ﬁt together smoothly without visible “seams.” If it is necessary to create a model of an already existing surface rather than one being designed from scratch, then it is necessary for the program to ﬁnd an efﬁcient way to subdivide the surface into small pieces, usually triangles, which can then be represented by splines.
Computer graphics programmers, designers, and researchers make use of many of the tools of manifold theory: coordinate charts, parametrizations, triangulations, and curvature, to name just a few.

Classical Mechanics
Classical mechanics is the study of systems that obey Newton’s laws of motion. The positions of all the objects in the system at any given time can be described by a set of numbers, or coordinates; typically, these are not independent of each other but instead must satisfy some relations. The relations can usually be interpreted as deﬁning a manifold in some Euclidean space.
For example, consider a rigid body moving through space under the inﬂuence of gravity. If we choose three noncollinear points P , Q, and R on the body (Fig. 1.11), the position of the body is completely speciﬁed once we know the coordinates of these three points, which correspond to a point in R 9. However, the positions of the three points cannot all be speciﬁed arbitrarily: because the body is rigid, they are subject to the constraint that the distances between pairs of points are ﬁxed. Thus, to position the body in space, we can arbitrarily specify the coordinates of P (three parameters), and then we can specify the position of Q by giving, say, its latitude and longitude on the sphere of radius d PQ, the ﬁxed distance between P and Q (two more parameters). Finally, having determined the position of the two points P and Q, the only remaining freedom is to rotate R around the line PQ; so we can specify the position of R by giving the angle Â that the plane PQR makes with

some reference plane (one more parameter). Thus the set of possible positions of the body is a certain 6-dimensional manifold M Â R9.
Newton’s second law of motion expresses the acceleration of the object—that is, the second derivatives of the coordinates of P , Q, R—in terms of the force of gravity, which is a certain function of the object’s position. This can be interpreted as a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for the position coordinates, whose solutions are all the possible paths the rigid body can take on the manifold M.
The study of classical mechanics can thus be interpreted as the study of ordinary differential equations on manifolds, a subject known as smooth dynamical systems. A wealth of interesting questions arise in this subject: How do solutions behave over the long term? Are there any equilibrium points or periodic trajectories? If so, are they stable; that is, do nearby trajectories stay nearby? A good understanding of manifolds is necessary to fully answer these questions.
General Relativity
Manifolds play a decisive role in Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the interactions among matter, energy, and gravitational forces. The central assertion of the theory is that spacetime (the collection of all points in space at all times in the history of the universe) can be modeled by a 4-dimensional manifold that carries a certain kind of geometric structure called a Lorentz metric; and this metric satisﬁes a system of partial differential equations called the Einstein ﬁeld

16

1 Introduction

equations. Gravitational effects are then interpreted as manifestations of the curvature of the Lorentz metric.
In order to describe the global structure of the universe, its history, and its possible futures, it is important to understand ﬁrst of all which 4-manifolds can carry Lorentz metrics, and for each such manifold how the topology of the manifold inﬂuences the properties of the metric. There are especially interesting relationships between the local geometry of spacetime (as reﬂected in the local distribution of matter and energy) and the global topological structure of the universe; these relationships are similar to those described above for Riemannian manifolds, but are more complicated because of the introduction of forces and motion into the picture. In particular, if we assume that on a cosmic scale the universe looks approximately the same at all points and in all directions (such a spacetime is said to be homogeneous and isotropic), then it turns out there is a critical value for the average density of matter and energy in the universe: above this density, the universe closes up on itself spatially and will collapse to a one-point singularity in a ﬁnite amount of time (the “big crunch”); below it, the universe extends inﬁnitely far in all directions and will expand forever. Interestingly, physicists’ best current estimates place the average density rather near the critical value, and they have so far been unable to determine whether it is above or below it, so they do not know whether the universe will go on existing forever or not.

String Theory
One of the most fundamental and perplexing challenges for modern physics is to resolve the incompatibilities between quantum theory and general relativity. An approach that some physicists consider very promising is called string theory, in which manifolds appear in several different starring roles.
One of the central tenets of string theory is that elementary particles should be modeled as vibrating submicroscopic 1-dimensional objects, called “strings,” instead of points. This approach promises to resolve many of the contradictions that plagued previous attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. But in order to obtain a consistent string theory, it seems to be necessary to assume that spacetime has more than four dimensions. We experience only four of them directly, because the dimensions beyond four are so tightly “curled up” that they are not visible on a macroscopic scale, much as a long but microscopically narrow 2dimensional cylinder would appear to be 1-dimensional when viewed on a large enough scale. The topological properties of the manifold that appears as the “crosssection” of the curled-up dimensions have such a profound effect on the observable dynamics of the resulting theory that it is possible to rule out most cross-sections a priori.
Several different kinds of string theory have been constructed, but all of them give consistent results only if the cross-section is a certain kind of 6-dimensional manifold known as a Calabi–Yau manifold. More recently, evidence has been un-

covered that all of these string theories are different limiting cases of a single underlying theory, dubbed M-theory, in which the cross-section is a 7-manifold. These developments in physics have stimulated profound advancements in the mathematical understanding of manifolds of dimensions 6 and 7, and Calabi–Yau manifolds in particular.
Another role that manifolds play in string theory is in describing the history of an elementary particle. As a string moves through spacetime, it traces out a 2dimensional manifold called its world sheet. Physical phenomena arise from the interactions among these different topological and geometric structures: the world sheet, the 6- or 7-dimensional cross-section, and the macroscopic 4-dimensional spacetime that we see.
It is still too early to predict whether string theory will turn out to be a useful description of the physical world. But it has already established a lasting place for itself in mathematics.
Manifolds are used in many more areas of mathematics than the ones listed here, but this brief survey should be enough to show you that manifolds have a rich assortment of applications. It is time to get to work.

Chapter 2
Topological Spaces

In this chapter we begin our study in earnest. The ﬁrst order of business is to build up enough machinery to give a proper deﬁnition of manifolds. The chief problem with the provisional deﬁnition given in Chapter 1 is that it depends on having an “ambient Euclidean space” in which our n-manifold lives. This introduces a great deal of extraneous structure that is irrelevant to our purposes. Instead, we would like to view a manifold as a mathematical object in its own right, not as a subset of some larger space. The key concept that makes this possible is that of a topological space, which is the main topic of this chapter.
We begin by deﬁning topological spaces, motivated by the open subset criterion for continuity in metric spaces. After the deﬁnition we introduce some of the important elementary notions associated with topological spaces such as closures, interiors, exteriors, convergence, continuity, and homeomorphisms, and then explore how to construct topologies from bases. At the end of the chapter we give the ofﬁcial deﬁnition of a manifold as a topological space with special properties.
Before you delve into this chapter, it would be a good idea to read quickly through the ﬁrst two appendices to this book if you have not already done so. Much of the background material that is prerequisite for reading the ﬁrst six chapters of this book is collected there.

Topologies
One of the most useful tools in analysis is the concept of a metric space. (See Appendix B for a brief review of metric space theory.) The most important examples, of course, are (subsets of) Euclidean spaces with the Euclidean metric, but many others, such as function spaces, arise frequently in analysis.
Our goal in this book is to study manifolds and those of their properties that are preserved by homeomorphisms (continuous maps with continuous inverses). To accomplish this, we could choose to view our manifolds as metric spaces. However, a metric still contains extraneous information. A homeomorphism between metric

2 Topological Spaces

spaces need not preserve distances (just think of the obvious homeomorphism between two spheres of different radii). So we will push the process of abstraction a step further, and come up with a kind of “space” without distances in which continuous functions still make sense.
The key idea behind the deﬁnition of this new kind of space is the open subset criterion for continuity (Theorem B.16, which you should review now). It shows that continuous functions between metric spaces can be detected knowing only the open subsets of both spaces. Motivated by this observation, we make the following deﬁnition. If X is a set, a topology on X is a collection T of subsets of X satisfying the following properties:
(i) X and ¿ are elements of T . (ii) T is closed under ﬁnite intersections: if U1; : : : ; Un are elements of T , then
their intersection U1 \ \ Un is an element of T . (iii) T is closed under arbitrary unions:Sif .U˛/˛2A is any (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) family
of elements of T , then their union ˛2A U˛ is an element of T .
A pair .X; T / consisting of a set X together with a topology T on X is called a topological space. Since we rarely have occasion to discuss any other type of space in this book, we sometimes follow the common practice of calling a topological space simply a space. As is typical in mathematics when discussing a set endowed with a particular kind of structure, if a particular choice of topology is understood from the context, we usually omit it from the notation and simply say “X is a topological space” or “X is a space.” Once X is endowed with a speciﬁc topology, the elements of X are usually called its points, and the sets that make up the topology are called the open subsets of X , or just open sets if both X and its topology are understood. With this terminology, the three deﬁning properties of a topology can be rephrased as follows:
X and ¿ are open subsets of X . Any intersection of ﬁnitely many open subsets of X is an open subset of X . Any union of arbitrarily many open subsets of X is an open subset of X .
In this form, you will recognize these as the properties of open subsets of a metric space enumerated in Proposition B.5.
Aside from the simplicity of the open subset criterion for continuity, the other reason for choosing open subsets as the primary objects in the deﬁnition of a topological space is that they give us a qualitative way to detect “nearness” to a point without necessarily having a quantitative measure of nearness as we would in a metric space. If X is a topological space and p 2 X , a neighborhood of p is just an open subset of X containing p. More generally, if K Â X , a neighborhood of the subset K is an open subset containing K. (In some books, the word “neighborhood” is used in the more general sense of a subset containing an open subset containing p or K; but for us neighborhoods are always open subsets.) We think of something being true “near p” if it is true in some (or every, depending on the context) neighborhood of p.
Here are some simple examples of topological spaces.

Metric spaces provide a rich source of examples of topological spaces. In fact, a large percentage of the topological spaces we need to consider are actually subsets of Euclidean spaces; since every such subset is a metric space in its own right (with the restriction of the Euclidean metric), it automatically inherits a metric topology. We call this the Euclidean topology, and unless we specify otherwise, subsets of Rn are always considered as topological spaces with this topology. Thus our intuition regarding topological spaces relies heavily on our understanding of subsets of Euclidean space.
Here are some standard subsets of Euclidean spaces that we will use throughout the book. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, each of these is considered as a topological space with the Euclidean (metric) topology.

Even though most of the topological spaces we consider are (subsets of) metric spaces with their metric topologies, it is important to recognize that not every topology can be deﬁned by a metric. A topological space X is said to be metrizable if its topology happens to be the metric topology generated by some metric on X . Some spaces that are not metrizable are described in Example 2.36 and Problem 3-9.
If X is metrizable, the metric that generates its topology is not uniquely determined, because many different metrics can give rise to the same topology (meaning that the same sets are open with respect to both metrics). The next exercise describes a necessary and sufﬁcient criterion for two metrics to generate the same topology, and some examples of such pairs of metrics.

I Exercise 2.4.
(a) Suppose M is a set and d; d0 are two different metrics on M . Prove that d and d0 generate the same topology on M if and only if the following condition is satisﬁed: for every x 2 M and every r > 0, there exist positive numbers r1 and r2 such that Br.1d 0/.x/ Â Br.d /.x/ and Br.2d /.x/ Â Br.d 0/.x/.

(e) Show that the discrete metric and the Euclidean metric generate the same topology on the set Z of integers.

Another important class of examples of topological spaces is obtained by taking open subsets of other spaces. If X is a topological space and Y is any open subset of X , then we can deﬁne a topology on Y just by declaring the open subsets of Y to be those open subsets of X that are contained in Y . The next exercise shows that this actually deﬁnes a topology on Y . (In the next chapter, we will see how to put a topology on any subset of a topological space.)
I Exercise 2.5. Suppose X is a topological space and Y is an open subset of X. Show
that the collection of all open subsets of X that are contained in Y is a topology on Y .

Because of the importance of neighborhoods in understanding “nearness” and continuity in a topological space, the deﬁnition of a topological space takes open subsets as the primary objects. But there is a complementary notion that is almost as important.
If X is a topological space, a subset F Â X is said to be a closed subset of X if its complement X X F is an open subset. If X and its topology are understood, closed subsets of X are often just called closed sets. From the deﬁnition of topological spaces, several properties follow immediately:
X and ¿ are closed subsets of X . Any union of ﬁnitely many closed subsets of X is a closed subset of X . Any intersection of arbitrarily many closed subsets of X is a closed subset of X.
A topology on a set X can be deﬁned by describing the collection of closed subsets, as long as they satisfy these three properties; the open subsets are then just those sets whose complements are closed.
Here are some examples of closed subsets of familiar topological spaces.

Example 2.7 (Closed Subsets).

(a) Any closed interval Œa; b Â R is a closed subset of R, as are the half-inﬁnite

closed intervals Œa; 1/ and . 1; b.

(b) Every closed ball in a metric space is a closed subset (Exercise B.8(a)).

(c) Every subset of a discrete space is closed.

(d) In the three-point space f1; 2; 3g with the topology of Example 2.1(c), the

closed subsets are ¿, f3g, f2; 3g, and f1; 2; 3g.

2 Topological Spaces

It is important to be aware that just as in metric spaces, “closed” is not synony-

mous with “not open”—subsets can be both open and closed, or neither open nor closed. For example, in any topological space X , the sets X and ¿ are both open and closed subsets of X . On the other hand, the half-open interval Œ0; 1/ is neither
open nor closed in R. Suppose X is a topological space and A is any subset of X . We deﬁne several
related subsets as follows. The closure of A in X , denoted by Ax, is the set

Ax

Ã

A

and

B

is

closed

in

X g:

The interior of A, denoted by IntA, is [
Int A D fC Â X W C Â A and C is open in X g:
It follows immediately from the properties of open and closed subsets that Ax is closed and IntA is open. To put it succinctly, Ax is “the smallest closed subset containing A,” and IntA is “the largest open subset contained in A.”
We also deﬁne the exterior of A, denoted by Ext A, as
ExtA D X X Ax;

and the boundary of A, denoted by @A, as
@A D X X .IntA [ ExtA/:
It follows from the deﬁnitions that for any subset A Â X , the whole space X is equal to the disjoint union of Int A, Ext A, and @A. The set A always contains all of its interior points and none of its exterior points, and may contain all, some, or none of its boundary points.
For many purposes, it is useful to have alternative characterizations of open and closed subsets, and of the interior, exterior, closure, and boundary of a given subset. The following proposition gives such characterizations. Some of these are probably familiar to you from your study of Euclidean and metric spaces. See Fig. 2.2 for illustrations of some of these characterizations.
Proposition 2.8. Let X be a topological space and let A Â X be any subset.
(a) A point is in Int A if and only if it has a neighborhood contained in A. (b) A point is in Ext A if and only if it has a neighborhood contained in X X A. (c) A point is in @A if and only if every neighborhood of it contains both a point of
A and a point of X X A. (d) A point is in Ax if and only if every neighborhood of it contains a point of A. (e) Ax D A [ @A D Int A [ @A. (f ) Int A and ExtA are open in X , while Ax and @A are closed in X . (g) The following are equivalent:
A is open in X .

(h) The following are equivalent:

I Exercise 2.9. Prove Proposition 2.8.

Given a topological space X and a set A Â X , we say that a point p 2 X is a

limit point of A if every neighborhood of p contains a point of A other than p

(which itself might or might not be in A). Limit points are also sometimes called

accumulation points or cluster points. A point p 2 A is called an isolated point of

A if p has a neighborhood U in X such that U \ A D fpg. Thus every point of A

is either a limit point or an isolated point, but not both. For example, if X D R and

Convergence and Continuity

2 Topological Spaces

The primary reason topological spaces were invented was that they provide the most general setting for studying the notions of convergence and continuity. For this reason, it is appropriate to introduce these concepts next. We begin with convergence.
The deﬁnition of what it means for a sequence of points in a metric space to converge to a point p (see Appendix B) is really just a fancy way of saying that as we go far enough out in the sequence, the points of the sequence become “arbitrarily close” to p.
In topological spaces, we use neighborhoods to encode the notion of “arbitrarily close.” Thus, if X is a topological space, .xi /1 iD1 is a sequence of points in X , and x 2 X , we say that the sequence converges to x, and x is the limit of the sequence, if for every neighborhood U of x there exists N 2 N such that x i 2 U for all i N . Symbolically, this is denoted by either xi ! x or limi!1 xi D x.
I Exercise 2.12. Show that in a metric space, this topological deﬁnition of convergence
is equivalent to the metric space deﬁnition.
I Exercise 2.13. Let X be a discrete topological space. Show that the only convergent
sequences in X are the ones that are eventually constant, that is, sequences .xi / such that xi D x for all but ﬁnitely many i .
I Exercise 2.14. Suppose X is a topological space, A is a subset of X, and .xi / is a
sequence of points in A that converges to a point x 2 X. Show that x 2 Ax.
Next we address the most important topological concept of all: continuity. If X and Y are topological spaces, a map f W X ! Y is said to be continuous if for every open subset U Â Y , its preimage f 1.U / is open in X .
The open subset criterion for continuity in metric spaces (Theorem B.16) says precisely that a map between metric spaces is continuous in this sense if and only if it is continuous in the usual "–ı sense. Therefore, all of the maps that you know from analysis to be continuous are also continuous as maps of topological spaces. Examples include polynomial functions from R to R, linear maps from Rn to Rk, and, more generally, every map from a subset of Rn to Rk whose component functions are continuous in the ordinary sense, such as polynomial, exponential, rational, logarithmic, absolute value, and trigonometric functions (where they are deﬁned), and functions built up from these by composition.
Continuity can be detected by closed subsets as well as open ones.
Proposition 2.15. A map between topological spaces is continuous if and only if the preimage of every closed subset is closed.
I Exercise 2.16. Prove Proposition 2.15.
The next proposition gives some elementary but important properties of continuous maps. The ease with which properties like this can be proved is one of the virtues of deﬁning continuity in terms of open subsets.

Proposition 2.17. Let X , Y , and Z be topological spaces.
(a) Every constant map f W X ! Y is continuous. (b) The identity map IdX W X ! X is continuous. (c) If f W X ! Y is continuous, so is the restriction of f to any open subset of X . (d) If f W X ! Y and g W Y ! Z are both continuous, then so is their composition
g ıf W X ! Z.

Proof. We prove (d) and leave the other parts as exercises. Suppose U is an open

subset of Z; we have to show that .g ı f / 1.U / is an open subset of X . By ele-

mentary set-theoretic considerations, .g ı f / 1.U / D f 1.g 1.U //. Applying the

deﬁnition of continuity to g, we see that g 1.U / is an open subset of Y ; and then

doing the same for f shows that f 1.g 1.U // is an open subset of X .

ut

I Exercise 2.18. Prove parts (a)–(c) of Proposition 2.17.

In metric spaces, one usually ﬁrst deﬁnes what it means for a map to be continuous at a point (see Appendix B), and then a continuous map is one that is continuous at every point. In topological spaces, continuity at a point is not such a useful concept. However, it is an important fact that continuity is a “local” property, in the sense that a map is continuous if and only if it is continuous in a neighborhood of every point. The precise statement is given in the following important proposition.

Proposition 2.19 (Local Criterion for Continuity). A map f W X ! Y between topological spaces is continuous if and only if each point of X has a neighborhood on which (the restriction of ) f is continuous.

Proof. If f is continuous, we may simply take each neighborhood to be X itself. Conversely, suppose f is continuous in a neighborhood of each point, and let U Â Y be any open subset; we have to show that f 1.U / is open. Any point x 2 f 1.U / has a neighborhood Vx on which f is continuous (Fig. 2.3). Continuity of f j Vx implies, in particular, that f jVx 1.U / is an open subset of Vx, and is therefore also an open subset of X . Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we see that

f jVx 1.U / D fx 2 Vx W f .x/ 2 U g D f 1.U / \ Vx;

28

2 Topological Spaces

so .f jVx / 1.U / is a neighborhood of x contained in f 1.U /. By Proposition

2.8(g), this implies that f 1.U / is an open subset of X .

ut

If X and Y are topological spaces, a homeomorphism from X to Y is a bijective map ' W X ! Y such that both ' and ' 1 are continuous. If there exists a homeomorphism between X and Y , we say that X and Y are homeomorphic or topologically equivalent. Sometimes this is abbreviated X Y .
I Exercise 2.20. Show that “homeomorphic” is an equivalence relation on the class of
all topological spaces.

The homeomorphism relation is the most fundamental relation in topology. In fact, as we mentioned in Chapter 1, topological properties are exactly those that are preserved by homeomorphisms. The next exercise shows, roughly speaking, that the topology is precisely the information preserved by homeomorphisms, and justiﬁes the choice of topological spaces as the right setting for studying properties preserved by homeomorphisms. What this means in practice is that any property that can be deﬁned purely in terms of open subsets will automatically be a topological property.
I Exercise 2.21. Let .X1; T1/ and .X2; T2/ be topological spaces and let f W X1 ! X2
be a bijective map. Show that f is a homeomorphism if and only if f .T1/ D T2 in the sense that U 2 T1 if and only if f .U / 2 T2.
I Exercise 2.22. Suppose f W X ! Y is a homeomorphism and U Â X is an open
subset. Show that f .U / is open in Y and the restriction f jU is a homeomorphism from U to f .U /.

It is also sometimes useful to compare different topologies on the same set. Given two topologies T1 and T2 on a set X , we say that T1 is ﬁner than T2 if T1 Ã T2, and coarser than T2 if T1 Â T2. The terminology is meant to suggest the picture of a subset that is open in a coarser topology being further subdivided into smaller open subsets in a ﬁner topology.
I Exercise 2.23. Let T1 and T2 be topologies on the same set X . Show that the identity
map of X is continuous as a map from .X; T1/ to .X; T2/ if and only if T1 is ﬁner than T2, and is a homeomorphism if and only if T1 D T2.

Here are a few explicit examples of homeomorphisms that you should keep in mind.

Example 2.24. Any open ball in Rn is homeomorphic to any other open ball; the homeomorphism can easily be constructed as a composition of translations x 7! x C x0 and dilations x 7! cx. Similarly, all spheres in Rn are homeomorphic to
each other. These examples illustrate that “size” is not a topological property. //

Example 2.25. Let Bn Â Rn be the unit ball, and deﬁne a map F W B n ! Rn by

F .x/ D

x jxj :

29

Fig. 2.4: Deforming a cube into a sphere.

Direct computation shows that the map G W Rn ! Bn deﬁned by

is an inverse for F . Thus F is bijective, and since F and F 1 D G are both contin-

uous, F is a homeomorphism. It follows that Rn is homeomorphic to Bn, and thus

“boundedness” is not a topological property.

//

Example 2.26. Another illustrative example is the homeomorphism between the

surface the unit

cubical surface of side 2 centered at the origin. Let ' W C ! S 2 be the map that

projects each point of C radially inward to the sphere (Fig. 2.4). More precisely,

given a point p 2 C , '.p/ is the unit vector in the direction of p. Thus ' is given

by the formula

.x; y; z/

'.x; y; z/ D p

;

x2 C y2 C z2

which is continuous on C by the usual arguments of elementary analysis (notice

that the denominator is always nonzero on C ). The next exercise shows that ' is

a homeomorphism. This example demonstrates that “corners” are not topological

properties.

theoretic reasons, continuity of ' 1 is not automatic. The next exercise gives an example of a continuous bijection whose inverse is not continuous.
I Exercise 2.28. Let X be the half-open interval Œ0; 1/ Â R, and let S1 be the unit circle
in C (both with their Euclidean metric topologies, as usual). Deﬁne a map a W X ! S1 by a.s/ D e2 is D cos 2 s C i sin 2 s (Fig. 2.5). Show that a is continuous and bijective but not a homeomorphism.

A map f W X ! Y (continuous or not) is said to be an open map if it takes open subsets of X to open subsets of Y ; in other words, if for every open subset U Â X , the image set f .U / is open in Y . It is said to be a closed map if it takes closed subsets of X to closed subsets of Y . A map can have any of the properties “open,” “closed,” or “continuous” independently of whether it has the others (see Problem 2-5).

I Exercise 2.29. Suppose f W X ! Y is a bijective continuous map. Show that the fol-
lowing are equivalent:
(a) f is a homeomorphism. (b) f is open. (c) f is closed.

Proposition 2.30. Suppose X and Y are topological spaces, and f W X ! Y is any map.
(a) f is continuous if and only if f Ax Â f .A/ for all A Â X . (b) f is closed if and only if f Ax Ã f .A/ for all A Â X . (c) f is continuous if and only if f 1.IntB/ Â Intf 1.B/ for all B Â Y . (d) f is open if and only if f 1.IntB/ Ã Intf 1.B/ for all B Â Y .

Proof. Problem 2-6.

There is a generalization of homeomorphisms that is often useful. We say that a map f W X ! Y between topological spaces is a local homeomorphism if every point x 2 X has a neighborhood U Â X such that f .U / is an open subset of Y and f jU W U ! f .U / is a homeomorphism.

Hausdorff Spaces

(a) Every homeomorphism is a local homeomorphism. (b) Every local homeomorphism is continuous and open. (c) Every bijective local homeomorphism is a homeomorphism.
I Exercise 2.32. Prove Proposition 2.31.

Hausdorff Spaces
The deﬁnition of topological spaces is wonderfully ﬂexible, and can be used to describe a rich assortment of concepts of “space.” However, without further qualiﬁcation, arbitrary topological spaces are far too general for most purposes, because they include some spaces whose behavior contradicts many of our basic spatial intuitions.
For example, in the spaces we are most familiar with, such as Euclidean spaces and metric spaces, a one-point set fpg is always closed, because around every point other than p there is a ball that does not include p. More generally, two points in a metric space always have disjoint neighborhoods. However, these properties do not always hold in topological spaces. Consider the set f1; 2; 3g with the topology of Example 2.1(c). In this space, 1 and 2 do not have disjoint neighborhoods, because every open subset that contains 2 also contains 1. Moreover, the set f1g is not closed, because its complement is not open. And if that does not seem strange enough, consider the constant sequence .2; 2; 2; : : : /: it follows from the deﬁnition of convergence that this sequence converges both to 2 and to 3!
I Exercise 2.33. Let Y be a topological space with the trivial topology. Show that every
sequence in Y converges to every point of Y .
The problem with these examples is that there are too few open subsets, so neighborhoods do not have the same intuitive meaning they have in metric spaces. In our study of manifolds, we want to rule out such “pathological” spaces, so we make the following deﬁnition. A topological space X is said to be a Hausdorff space if given any pair of distinct points p1; p2 2 X , there exist neighborhoods U1 of p1 and U2 of p2 with U1 \ U2 D ¿. This property is often summarized by saying “points can be separated by open subsets.”
Example 2.34 (Hausdorff Spaces).
Every metric space is Hausdorff: if p1 and p2 are distinct, let r D d.p1; p2/; then the open balls of radius r=2 around p1 and p2 are disjoint by the triangle inequality. Every discrete space is Hausdorff, because fp1g and fp2g are disjoint open subsets when p1 ¤ p2.

32

2 Topological Spaces

Every open subset of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff: if V Â X is open in the

Hausdorff space X , and p1; p2 are distinct points in V , then in X there are open subsets U1; U2 separating p1 and p2, and the sets U1 \ V and U2 \ V are

open in V , disjoint, and contain p1 and p2, respectively.

//

I Exercise 2.35. Suppose X is a topological space, and for every p 2 X there exists a
continuous function f W X ! R such that f 1.0/ D fpg. Show that X is Hausdorff.

Example 2.36 (Non-Hausdorff Spaces). The trivial topology on any set containing

more than one element is not Hausdorff, nor is the topology on f1; 2; 3g described

in Example 2.1(c). Because every metric space is Hausdorff, it follows that these

spaces are not metrizable.

//

These non-Hausdorff examples are obviously contrived, and have little relevance to our study of manifolds. But Problem 3-16 describes a space that would be a manifold except for the fact that it fails to be Hausdorff.
Hausdorff spaces have many of the properties that we expect of metric spaces, such as those expressed in the following proposition.

Proposition 2.37. Let X be a Hausdorff space.

(a) Every ﬁnite subset of X is closed. (b) If a sequence .pi / in X converges to a limit p 2 X , the limit is unique.

Proof. For part (a), consider ﬁrst a set fp0g containing only one point. Given p ¤

p0, the Hausdorff property says that there exist disjoint neighborhoods U of p and V of p0. In particular, U is a neighborhood of p contained in X X fp 0g, so fp0g is

closed by Proposition 2.8(h). It follows that ﬁnite subsets are closed, because they

are ﬁnite unions of one-point sets.

To prove that limits are unique, suppose on the contrary that a sequence .p i / has

two distinct limits p and p0. By the Hausdorff property, there exist disjoint neigh-

borhoods U of p and U 0 of p0. By deﬁnition of convergence, there exist N; N 0 2 N

such that i N implies pi 2 U and i N 0 implies pi 2 U 0. But since U and U 0

are disjoint, this is a contradiction when i maxfN; N 0g.

ut

I Exercise 2.38. Show that the only Hausdorff topology on a ﬁnite set is the discrete
topology.

Another important property of Hausdorff spaces is expressed in the following proposition.

Proposition 2.39. Suppose X is a Hausdorff space and A Â X . If p 2 X is a limit point of A, then every neighborhood of p contains inﬁnitely many points of A.

Proof. See Problem 2-7.

Bases and Countability

33

Bases and Countability

In metric spaces, not all open subsets are created equal. Among open subsets, the open balls are the most fundamental (being deﬁned directly in terms of the metric), and all other open subsets are deﬁned in terms of those. As a consequence, most deﬁnitions and proofs in metric space theory tend to focus on the open balls rather than arbitrary open subsets. For example, the deﬁnition of limit points in the context of metric spaces is usually phrased this way: if A is a subset of the metric space M , a point x is a limit point of A if every open ball around x contains a point of A other than x.
Most topological spaces do not come naturally equipped with any “special” open subsets analogous to open balls in a metric space. Nevertheless, in many speciﬁc situations, it is useful to single out a collection of certain open subsets, such that all other open subsets are unions of the selected ones.
Let X be a topological space. A collection B of subsets of X is called a basis for the topology of X (plural: bases) if the following two conditions hold:

(i) Every element of B is an open subset of X . (ii) Every open subset of X is the union of some collection of elements of B.

(It is important to observe that the empty set is the union of the “empty collection” of elements of B.) If the topology on X is understood, sometimes we will just say that B is a basis for X .

I Exercise 2.40. Suppose X is a topological space, and B is a basis for its topology.
Show that a subset U Â X is open if and only if it satisﬁes the following condition:

for each p 2 U , there exists B 2 B such that p 2 B Â U .

(2.1)

If a subset U Â X satisﬁes (2.1), we say that it satisﬁes the basis criterion with respect to B.

Example 2.41 (Bases for Some Familiar Topologies).

Let M be a metric space. Every open ball in M is an open subset by Exercise

B.8(a), and every open subset is a union of open balls by Exercise B.8(b). Thus

the collection of all open balls in M is a basis for the metric topology.

If X is any set with the discrete topology, the collection of all singleton subsets

of X is a basis for its topology.

If X is a set with the trivial topology, the one-element collection B D fX g is a

basis for its topology.

//

I Exercise 2.42. Show that each of the following collections Bi is a basis for the Eu-
clidean topology on Rn.
(a) B1 D fCs.x/ W x 2 Rn and s > 0g, where Cs.x/ is the open cube of side length s centered at x:

2 Topological Spaces

(b) B2 D fBr .x/ W r is rational and x has rational coordinatesg.

When we have a basis for a topology on Y , it is sufﬁcient (and often much easier) to check continuity of maps into Y using only basis subsets, as the following proposition shows.

Proposition 2.43. Let X and Y be topological spaces and let B be a basis for Y . A
map f W X ! Y is continuous if and only if for every basis subset B 2 B, the subset f 1.B/ is open in X .

Proof. One direction is easy: if f is continuous, the preimage of every open subset,

and thus certainly every basis subset, is open. Conversely, suppose f 1.B/ is open

for every B 2 B. Let U Â Y be open, and let x 2 f 1.U /. Because U satisﬁes the

basis criterion with respect to B, there is a basis set B such that f .x/ 2 B Â U . This

implies that x 2 f 1.B/ Â f 1.U /, which means that x has a neighborhood con-

tained in f 1.U /. Since this is true for every x 2 f 1.U /, it follows that f 1.U /

is open.

ut

Deﬁning a Topology from a Basis
Now suppose we start with a set X that is not yet endowed with a topology. It is often convenient to deﬁne a topology on X by starting with some distinguished open subsets, and then deﬁning all the other open subsets as unions of these. This is exactly how open subsets of a metric space are deﬁned: ﬁrst, the open balls are deﬁned in terms of the metric, and then general open subsets are deﬁned in terms of the open balls. In other words, we started with a basis, and used that to deﬁne the topology.
Not every collection of sets can be a basis for a topology. The next proposition gives necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a collection of subsets of X to be a basis for some topology on X .
Proposition 2.44. Let X be a set, and suppose B is a collection of subsets of X . Then B is a basis for some topology on X if and only if it satisﬁes the following two conditions:
S (i) B2B B D X . (ii) If B1; B2 2 B and x 2 B1 \ B2, there exists an element B3 2 B such that
x 2 B3 Â B1 \ B2.
If so, there is a unique topology on X for which B is a basis, called the topology generated by B.
Proof. If B is a basis for some topology, the proof that it satisﬁes (i) and (ii) is left as an easy exercise. Conversely, suppose that B satisﬁes (i) and (ii), and let T be the collection of all unions of elements of B.

Bases and Countability

Fig. 2.6: Proof that U1 \ U2 2 T .

First, we need to show that T satisﬁes the three deﬁning properties of a topology.

Condition (i) implies that X 2 T , and the empty set is also in T , being the union

of the empty collection of elements of B. A union of elements of T is a union of

unions of elements of B, and therefore is itself a union of elements of B; thus T is

closed under arbitrary unions.

To show that T is closed under ﬁnite intersections, suppose ﬁrst that U 1; U2 2 T .

Then, for any x 2 U1 \U2, the deﬁnition of T implies that there exist basis elements B1; B2 2 B such that x 2 B1 Â U1 and x 2 B2 Â U2 (Fig. 2.6). But then the fact that B satisﬁes condition (ii) guarantees that there exists B3 2 B such that x 2 B3 Â

B1 \ B2 Â U1 \ U2. Because U1 \ U2 is the union of all such sets B3 as x varies,

it is an element of T . This shows that T is closed under pairwise intersections, and

closure under ﬁnite intersections follows easily by induction. This completes the

proof that T is a topology.

To see that B is a basis for T , just note that every element of B is in T (being

a union of one element of B), and every element of T is a union of elements of B

by deﬁnition. By deﬁnition of a basis for a topology, it is clear that T is the only

topology for which B is a basis.

ut

I Exercise 2.45. Complete the proof of the preceding proposition by showing that every
basis satisﬁes (i) and (ii).

Countability Properties
Whereas the Hausdorff property ensures that a topological space has “enough” open subsets to conform to our spatial intuition, for many purposes (including the study of manifolds), it is useful to restrict attention to spaces that do not have “too many” open subsets. It would be too restrictive to ask for countably many open subsets,

36

2 Topological Spaces

because even R has uncountably many. But it turns out that just the right balance is struck by requiring the existence of a basis that is countable.
There are actually several countability properties that are useful. We begin with the weakest one. If X is a topological space and p 2 X , a collection B p of neighborhoods of p is called a neighborhood basis for X at p if every neighborhood of p contains some B 2 Bp. We say that X is ﬁrst countable if there exists a countable neighborhood basis at each point.

Example 2.46. If X is a metric space and p 2 X , the set of balls Br .p/ with rational

radii is easily seen to be a neighborhood basis at p, so every metric space is ﬁrst

countable.

//

For some purposes it is useful to have a neighborhood basis satisfying the following stronger property. If X is a topological space and p 2 X , a sequence .U i /1 iD1 of neighborhoods of p is called a nested neighborhood basis at p if U iC1 Â Ui for each i , and every neighborhood of p contains U i for some i .
Lemma 2.47 (Nested Neighborhood Basis Lemma). Let X be a ﬁrst countable space. For every p 2 X , there exists a nested neighborhood basis at p.

Proof. If there is a ﬁnite neighborhood basis fV1; : : : ; Vkg at p, just let Ui D V1 \ \ Vk for all i . Otherwise, there is a countably inﬁnite neighborhood basis, which
we may write as fVi g1 iD1. Setting Ui D V1 \ \ Vi for each i does the trick. ut
The most important feature of ﬁrst countable spaces is that they are the spaces in which sequences are sufﬁcient to detect most topological properties. The next lemma makes this precise. If .xi /1 iD1 is a sequence of points in a topological space X and A Â X , we say that the sequence is eventually in A if xi 2 A for all but ﬁnitely many values of i .

Lemma 2.48 (Sequence Lemma). Suppose X is a ﬁrst countable space, A is any subset of X , and x is any point of X .
(a) x 2 Ax if and only if x is a limit of a sequence of points in A. (b) x 2 Int A if and only if every sequence in X converging to x is eventually in A. (c) A is closed in X if and only if A contains every limit of every convergent
sequence of points in A. (d) A is open in X if and only if every sequence in X converging to a point of A is
eventually in A.

Proof. Problem 2-14.

ut

Virtually all of the spaces we work with in this book turn out to be ﬁrst countable, so one has to work rather hard to come up with a space that is not. Problem 3-9 gives an example of such a space.
For our study of manifolds, we are mostly interested in a much stronger countability property. A topological space is said to be second countable if it admits a countable basis for its topology.

Bases and Countability

37

Example 2.49. Every Euclidean space is second countable, because as Exercise

2.42(b) shows, it has a countable basis.

//

The next theorem describes some important consequences of second countability.
If X is any topological space, a collection U of subsets of X is said to be a cover of X , or to cover X , if every point of X is in at least one of the sets of U. It is called an open cover if each of the sets in U is open, and a closed cover if each set is closed. Given any cover U, a subcover of U is a subcollection U0 Â U that still covers X .

Theorem 2.50 (Properties of Second Countable Spaces). Suppose X is a second countable space.

(a) X is ﬁrst countable. (b) X contains a countable dense subset. (c) Every open cover of X has a countable subcover.

Proof. Let B be a countable basis for X . To prove (a), just note that for any p 2 X ,

the elements of B that contain p form a countable neighborhood basis at p.

The proof of (b) is left as an exercise. To prove (c), let U be an arbitrary open cover of X . Deﬁne a subset B 0 Â B by

declaring that B 2 B0 if and only if B is entirely contained in some element of U. Because any subset of a countable set is countable, B 0 is a countable set.
Now, for each element B 2 B 0, choose an element UB 2 U such that B Â UB (this is possible by the way we deﬁned B 0). The collection U0 D fUB W B 2 B0g is

a countable subset of U; the proposition will be proved if we can show that it still

covers X .

If x 2 X is arbitrary, then x 2 U0 for some open subset U0 2 U. By the basis

criterion, there is some B 2 B such that x 2 B Â U0. This means, in particular, that

B 2 B0, and therefore there is a set UB 2 U0 such that x 2 B Â UB . This shows that

U0 is a cover and completes the proof of (c).

ut

I Exercise 2.51. Prove part (b) of the preceding theorem.

A topological space X is said to be separable if it contains a countable dense subset, and to be a Lindelo¨f space if every open cover of X has a countable subcover. We have now seen four different countability properties that a topological space might have: ﬁrst and second countability, separability, and the Lindelo¨f property. Theorem 2.50 can be summarized by saying that every second countable space is ﬁrst countable, separable, and Lindelo¨f. None of these implications is reversible, however, and none of the three weaker countability properties implies any of the others, as Problem 2-18 shows. (In fact, even the assumption of all three weaker properties is not sufﬁcient to imply second countability, as [Mun00, Example 3, p. 192] shows.) For metric spaces, however, things are simpler: every metric space is ﬁrst countable (Example 2.46), and Problem 2-20 shows that second countability, separability, and the Lindelo¨f property are all equivalent for metric spaces.
Most “reasonable” spaces are second countable. For example, Exercise 2.49 shows that Rn is second countable. Moreover, any open subset U of a second countable space X is second countable: starting with a countable basis for X , just throw

38

2 Topological Spaces

away all the basis sets that are not contained in U ; then it is easy to check that the remaining basis sets form a countable basis for the topology of U .

Manifolds
We are almost ready to give the ofﬁcial deﬁnition of manifolds. We need just one more preliminary deﬁnition, which captures in a precise way the intuitive idea that a manifold should look “locally” like Euclidean space. A topological space M is said to be locally Euclidean of dimension n if every point of M has a neighborhood in M that is homeomorphic to an open subset of Rn.
For some purposes, it is useful to be more speciﬁc about the kind of open subset we use to characterize locally Euclidean spaces. The next lemma shows that we could have replaced “open subset” by open ball or by R n itself.
Lemma 2.52. A topological space M is locally Euclidean of dimension n if and only if either of the following properties holds:
(a) Every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open ball in R n. (b) Every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R n.
Proof. It is immediate that any space with property (a) or (b) is locally Euclidean of dimension n. Conversely, suppose M is locally Euclidean of dimension n. Because any open ball in Rn is homeomorphic to Rn itself (Example 2.25), properties (a) and (b) are equivalent, so we need only prove (a).
Given a point p 2 M , let U be a neighborhood of p that admits a homeomorphism ' W U ! V , where V is an open subset of Rn. The fact that V is open in Rn means that there is some open ball B around '.p/ that is contained in V , and then Exercise 2.22 shows that ' 1.B/ is a neighborhood of p homeomorphic to B. ut
Suppose M is locally Euclidean of dimension n. If U Â M is an open subset that is homeomorphic to an open subset of Rn, then U is called a coordinate domain, and any homeomorphism ' from U to an open subset of R n is called a coordinate map. The pair .U; '/ is called a coordinate chart (or just a chart) for M . A coordinate domain that is homeomorphic to a ball in R n is called a coordinate ball. (When M has dimension 2, we sometimes use the term coordinate disk.) The preceding lemma shows that every point in a locally Euclidean space is contained in a coordinate ball. If p 2 M and U is a coordinate domain containing p, we say that U is a coordinate neighborhood or Euclidean neighborhood of p.
The deﬁnition of locally Euclidean spaces makes sense even when n D 0. Because R0 is a single point, Lemma 2.52(b) implies that a space is locally Euclidean of dimension 0 if and only if each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to a one-point space, or in other words if and only if the space is discrete.
We come now to the culmination of this chapter: the ofﬁcial deﬁnition of manifolds.

Manifolds

39

An n-dimensional topological manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space

that is locally Euclidean of dimension n. Since the only manifolds we consider in

this book are topological manifolds, we usually call them simply n-dimensional

manifolds, or n-manifolds, or even just manifolds if the dimension is understood

or irrelevant. (The term “topological manifold” is usually used only to emphasize

that the kind of manifold under consideration is the kind we have deﬁned here, in

contrast to other kinds of manifolds that can be deﬁned, such as “smooth manifolds”

or “complex manifolds.” We do not treat any of these other kinds of manifolds in

this book.) A shorthand notation that is in common use is to write “let M n be a manifold”

to mean “let M be a manifold of dimension n.” The superscript n is not part of

the name of the manifold, and is usually dropped after the ﬁrst time the manifold

is introduced. One must be a bit careful to distinguish this notation from the n-fold

Cartesian product M n D M

M , but it is usually clear from the context which

is meant. We do not use this shorthand in this book, but you should be aware of it

because you will encounter it in your reading. The most obvious example of an n-manifold is R n itself. More generally, any
open subset of Rn—or in fact of any n-manifold—is again an n-manifold, as the

next proposition shows.

Proposition 2.53. Every open subset of an n-manifold is an n-manifold.

Proof. Let M be an n-manifold, and let V be an open subset of M . Any p 2 V has a neighborhood (in M ) that is homeomorphic to an open subset of R n; the intersection
of that neighborhood with V is still open, still homeomorphic to an open subset of Rn, and is contained in V , so V is locally Euclidean of dimension n. We remarked
above that any open subset of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff and any open subset of a second countable space is second countable. Therefore V is an n-manifold. ut

I Exercise 2.54. Show that a topological space is a 0-manifold if and only if it is a count-
able discrete space.

In the next few chapters we will develop many examples of manifolds. But it is
also important to bear in mind some examples of spaces that are not manifolds. Two simple examples are the union of the x-axis and the y-axis in R 2, and the conical surface in R3 deﬁned by x2 C y2 D z2, both with their Euclidean topologies (Fig. 2.7). In each case, the origin has no Euclidean neighborhood. We do not yet have
enough topological tools to prove this, but you will be asked to prove it in Chapter
4 (Problem 4-4).

Remarks on the Deﬁnition of Manifolds
There are several points that should be noted about the deﬁnition of manifolds. The ﬁrst remark is that the deﬁnition of a manifold requires that every manifold
have a speciﬁc, well-deﬁned dimension. This rules out, for example, spaces such as

40

2 Topological Spaces

Fig. 2.7: Some nonmanifolds.

a disjoint union of a line and a plane in R3, in which each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to some Euclidean space, but the dimensions would have to be different for different points.
Actually, this raises a question whose answer might seem obvious, but which in fact turns out to be quite subtle: Is the dimension of a manifold an intrinsic topological property? Or, to put it another way, is it possible for a topological space to be simultaneously an n-manifold and a manifold of some other dimension? The answer, as one would probably expect, is no; but it is surprisingly hard to prove. We state the full theorem here for reference; but for now, we can only prove it in the trivial 0-dimensional case.
Theorem 2.55 (Invariance of Dimension). If m ¤ n, a nonempty topological space cannot be both an m-manifold and an n-manifold.

Proof of the zero-dimensional case. Suppose M is a 0-manifold. Then M is a dis-

crete space, so every singleton in M is an open subset. But in an n-manifold for

n > 0, every nonempty open subset contains a coordinate ball, which is uncount-

able, so no singleton can be open.

ut

The proof of invariance of dimension in the higher-dimensional cases requires substantially more machinery, and will be treated in later chapters: the 1-dimensional case in Problem 4-2, the 2-dimensional case in Problem 8-2, and the general case in Problem 13-3.
This theorem is stated only for nonempty spaces because the empty set satisﬁes the deﬁnition of an n-manifold for every n. For most purposes, the empty set is not an interesting manifold. But in certain circumstances, it is important to allow empty manifolds, so we simply agree that the empty set qualiﬁes as a manifold of any dimension.

Manifolds

41

Our second remark is that students often wonder whether this deﬁnition allows any new things to be considered manifolds that were not already allowed under the provisional deﬁnition we gave in Chapter 1. Are there topological spaces that ﬁt the deﬁnition of topological manifolds, and are not realizable as locally Euclidean subsets of Rk?
The answer, in fact, is no: we have not introduced any new manifolds, because it can be proved that every topological n-manifold is in fact homeomorphic to some subset of a Euclidean space. The proof of one special case (compact manifolds) is fairly straightforward, and will be described in Chapter 4. But the proof of the general case involves some rather intricate topological dimension theory that would take us too far aﬁeld, so we do not treat it here. You can ﬁnd a complete proof in [Mun00].
Even though this abstract deﬁnition of a manifold as a topological space does not enlarge the class of manifolds, it nonetheless makes life immeasurably easier for us, because we can introduce new manifolds without having to exhibit them as subsets of Euclidean spaces. In the chapters to come, there are many instances where this freedom makes manifolds much easier to deﬁne.

Our ﬁnal remark is that the deﬁnition of manifolds given here, although probably the most commonly used one, is not employed by everyone. Some authors, for example, require a manifold to be a locally Euclidean separable metric space instead of a second countable Hausdorff space. (Recall that a space is said to be separable if it has a countable dense subset.) The following proposition shows that spaces deﬁned in this way are also manifolds in our sense.

Proposition 2.56. A separable metric space that is locally Euclidean of dimension n is an n-manifold.

Proof. Every metric space is Hausdorff, and Problem 2-20 shows that a separable

metric space is second countable.

ut

In fact, the converse to this proposition is true: every manifold is separable and metrizable. Separability follows from Theorem 2.50, but metrizability is considerably more difﬁcult to prove. One way to prove it is by using the fact we mentioned earlier, that every manifold is homeomorphic to a subset of some Euclidean space. Another approach is via the Urysohn metrization theorem (see [Mun00], for example). However, both approaches are beyond our scope; since we have no need for this converse, we do not pursue it any further.
Other authors replace the requirement that manifolds be second countable with some other property that has similar consequences. One popular such property is called paracompactness; we will discuss it in Chapter 4 and show that it results in a nearly equivalent deﬁnition of manifolds.
Another source of variability in the deﬁnition of manifolds is the fact that some authors simply omit the Hausdorff condition or second countability or both from their deﬁnitions. In such cases, one has to speak of a “Hausdorff manifold” or “second countable manifold” or “paracompact manifold” whenever necessary. But virtually all of the important examples of manifolds do in fact have these properties,

42

and most interesting theorems about manifolds require them, so very little would be gained by working with a more general deﬁnition. In particular, the claim we made above that every manifold is homeomorphic to a subset of a Euclidean space would be false if we allowed manifolds that are not Hausdorff and second countable. The Hausdorff and second countability hypotheses are not redundant: Problems 2-22, 3-16, and 4-6 describe some spaces that would be manifolds except for the failure of the Hausdorff property or second countability. You will probably agree that these are strange spaces that would not ﬁt our intuitive idea of what a manifold should look like.
Manifolds with Boundary
It is intuitively evident (though by no means easy to prove) that a closed ball in Rn is not a manifold, because a point on its boundary does not have any Euclidean neighborhood. Nonetheless, closed balls and many spaces like them have important applications in the theory of manifolds. Thus it is useful to consider a class of spaces that is somewhat broader than the class of manifolds, which allows for the existence of some sort of “boundary.”
Near their boundaries, spaces in this new class are modeled on the closed ndimensional upper half-space Hn Â Rn, deﬁned by
Hn D f.x1; : : : ; xn/ 2 Rn W xn 0g :
An n-dimensional manifold with boundary is a second countable Hausdorff space in which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic either to an open subset of Rn, or to an open subset of Hn, considering Hn as a topological space with its Euclidean topology (see Fig. 2.8). Note that, despite the terminology, a manifold with boundary is not necessarily a manifold. (We will have more to say about this below.)

Manifolds

43

If M is an n-manifold with boundary, we deﬁne a coordinate chart for M to be
a pair .U; '/, where U Â M is open and ' is a homeomorphism from U to an open subset of either Rn or Hn. Just as in the case of manifolds, the set U is called a
coordinate domain, and ' is called a coordinate map. We use the notation @Hn to denote the boundary of Hn, and Int Hn to denote its
interior, considering Hn as a subset of Rn. For n > 0, this means

@Hn D f.x1; : : : ; xn/ W xn D 0g; Int Hn D f.x1; : : : ; xn/ W xn > 0g:

When n D 0, we have H0 D R0 D f0g, so IntH0 D H0 and @H0 D ¿. It follows
that 0-dimensional manifolds with boundary are no different from 0-manifolds.
When it is important to make the distinction, we say .U; '/ is an interior chart if '.U / is an open subset of Rn (which includes the case in which '.U / is an open subset of Hn that is contained in IntHn); and a boundary chart if '.U / is an open subset of Hn with '.U / \ @Hn ¤ ¿.

Example 2.57 (Manifolds with Boundary). The upper half-space H n itself is an n-

manifold with boundary, with the identity map as a global coordinate map. Similarly,

any closed or half-open interval in R is a 1-manifold with boundary, for which charts are easy to construct. Another important example is the closed unit ball Bxn with the Euclidean topology. It is not hard to see intuitively that Bxn is an n-manifold with

boundary; you can probably construct appropriate charts yourself, or you can wait

until Chapter 3 where charts will be suggested in Problem 3-4.

//

If M is an n-manifold with boundary, a point p 2 M is called an interior point of M if it is in the domain of an interior chart; and it is called a boundary point of M if it is in the domain of a boundary chart that takes p to @H n. The boundary of M , denoted by @M , is the set of all its boundary points, and its interior, denoted by Int M , is the set of all its interior points. Every point of M is either an interior point or a boundary point: if p 2 M is in the domain of an interior chart, then it is
an interior point; on the other hand, if it is in the domain of a boundary chart, then it is an interior point if its image lies in Int Hn, and a boundary point if the image lies in @Hn.
Note that these are new meanings for the terms boundary and interior, distinct
from their use earlier in this chapter in reference to subsets of topological spaces.
If M is a manifold with boundary, it might have nonempty boundary in this new sense, irrespective of whether it has any boundary points as a subset of some other
topological space. Usually the distinction is clear from the context, but if necessary
we can always distinguish the two meanings by referring to the topological boundary (for the original meaning) or the manifold boundary (for this new meaning) as
appropriate. For example, as you will be asked to show in Problem 3-4, the disk Bx2 is a mani-
fold with boundary, whose manifold boundary is the circle. Its topological boundary as a subset of R2 happens to be the circle as well. However, if we think of Bx2 as a

44

2 Topological Spaces

topological space in its own right, then as a subset of itself, it has empty topological boundary. And if we think of it as a subset of R3 (by identifying R2 with the xy-plane), then its topological boundary is the entire disk!
Although the terminology regarding manifolds with boundary is well established, it can be confusing, and there are some pitfalls that you will need to watch out for. First of all, as mentioned above, a manifold with boundary is not necessarily a manifold, because boundary points do not have locally Euclidean neighborhoods (see Corollary 2.60 below). Moreover, a manifold with boundary might have empty boundary: there is nothing in the deﬁnition that requires the boundary to be a nonempty set. On the other hand, every n-manifold is automatically a manifold with boundary, in which every point is an interior point.
Even though the term manifold with boundary encompasses manifolds as well, in order to avoid any possibility of ambiguity, we sometimes use redundant terms such as manifold without boundary to refer to a manifold in the sense in which we deﬁned it originally, and manifold with or without boundary to mean a manifold with boundary, with emphasis on the possibility that its boundary might be empty. The word manifold without further qualiﬁcation always means a manifold without boundary.

Proposition 2.58. If M is an n-dimensional manifold with boundary, then IntM is an open subset of M , which is itself an n-dimensional manifold without boundary.

Proof. Problem 2-25.

ut

There is a subtlety about these deﬁnitions that might not be immediately evident. Although the interior and boundary of M are well-deﬁned subsets whose union is M , and it might seem intuitively rather obvious that they are disjoint from each other, we have no way of proving at this stage that a point p 2 M cannot be simultaneously a boundary point and an interior point, meaning that there is one interior chart whose domain contains p, and another boundary chart that sends p to @H n. After we have developed some more machinery, you will be able to prove the following theorem.

Theorem 2.59 (Invariance of the Boundary). If M is a manifold with boundary, then a point of M cannot be both a boundary point and an interior point. Thus @M and Int M are disjoint subsets whose union is M .

For the proof, see Problem 4-3 for the 1-dimensional case, Problem 8-3 for the 2-dimensional case, and Problem 13-4 for the general case. We will go ahead and assume this result when convenient (always indicating when we do so), as well as the following important corollary.

Corollary 2.60. If M is a nonempty n-dimensional manifold with boundary, then @M is closed in M , and M is an n-manifold if and only if @M D ¿.

Proof. Because Int M is an open subset of M by Proposition 2.58, it follows from Theorem 2.59 that @M D M X IntM is closed. If M is a manifold, then every point

is in the domain of an interior chart, so M D Int M , and it follows from Theorem

2.59 that @M D ¿. Conversely, if @M D ¿, then M D Int M , which is a manifold

Chapter 3
New Spaces from Old

In this chapter we introduce four standard ways of constructing new topological spaces from given ones: subspaces, product spaces, disjoint union spaces, and quotient spaces. We explore how various topological properties are affected by these constructions, and we show how each topology is characterized by which maps it makes continuous. At the end of the chapter we explore in some detail two speciﬁc classes of constructions that lead naturally to quotient spaces: adjunction spaces and group actions. Throughout the chapter we use these tools to build new examples of manifolds.

Subspaces
We have seen a number of examples of topological spaces that are subsets of R n, with the topology induced by the Euclidean metric. We have also seen that open subsets of a topological space inherit a topology from the containing space. In this section, we show that arbitrary subsets of topological spaces can also be viewed as topological spaces in their own right.
Let X be a topological space, and let S Â X be any subset. We deﬁne a topology TS on S by
TS D fU Â S W U D S \ V for some open subset V Â X g:
In other words, the open subsets of TS are the intersections with S of the open subsets of X (Fig. 3.1).
I Exercise 3.1. Prove that TS is a topology on S .
The topology TS is called the subspace topology (or sometimes the relative topology) on S . A subset of a topological space X , considered as a topological space with the subspace topology, is called a subspace of X . Henceforth, whenever

we mention a subset of a topological space, we always consider it as a topological space with the subspace topology unless otherwise speciﬁed.
I Exercise 3.2. Suppose S is a subspace of X. Prove that a subset B Â S is closed in S
if and only if it is equal to the intersection of S with some closed subset of X.
I Exercise 3.3. Let M be a metric space, and let S Â M be any subset. Show that the
subspace topology on S is the same as the metric topology obtained by restricting the metric of M to pairs of points in S .

You have probably also encountered the word “subspace” in the context of vector spaces, where only certain subsets (those that are closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication) are subspaces. By contrast, in topology, there is no restriction on what kinds of subsets can be considered as subspaces: every subset of a topological space is a subspace, as long as it is endowed with the subspace topology.
It is vital to be aware that openness and closedness are not properties of a set by itself, but rather of a subset in relation to a particular topological space. If S is a subspace of X , it is quite possible for a subset of S to be closed or open in S but not in X , as the next example illustrates.

Example 3.4. Consider the subspaces S1 D Œ0; 1 [ .2; 3/ and S2 D f1=ng1 nD1 of R (Fig. 3.2). Notice that the interval Œ0; 1 is not an open subset of R. But it is an open

subset of S1, because Œ0; 1 is the intersection with S1 of the open interval . 1; 2/. In S2, the one-point sets f1=ng are all open (why?), so the subspace topology on S 2

is discrete.

For clarity, if S is a subspace of X , we sometimes say that a subset U Â S is relatively open or relatively closed in S , to emphasize that we mean open or closed

in the subspace topology on S , not open or closed as a subset of X . Similarly, if x is a point in S , a neighborhood of x in S in the subspace topology is sometimes called a relative neighborhood of x. The next proposition gives some conditions under which there is a relationship between being (relatively) open in S and open in X .

Proposition 3.5. Suppose S is a subspace of the topological space X .
(a) If U Â S Â X , U is open in S , and S is open in X , then U is open in X . The same is true with “closed” in place of “open.”
(b) If U is a subset of S that is either open or closed in X , then it is also open or closed in S , respectively.
I Exercise 3.6. Prove the preceding proposition.

If X is a topological space and U Â S Â X , then there is a potential ambiguity about what we mean when we speak of the “closure of U ,” because in general the closure of U in S (with its subspace topology) need not be the same as its closure in X . Similar remarks apply to the “interior of U .” In this situation, the notations Ux and IntU are always interpreted to mean the closure of U in X and the interior of U in X , respectively.
I Exercise 3.7. Suppose X is a topological space and U Â S Â X.
(a) Show that the closure of U in S is equal to Ux \ S . (b) Show that the interior of U in S contains Int U \ S ; give an example to show that
they might not be equal.

The next property we will prove about the subspace topology is so fundamental that, in a sense that we will explain later, it completely characterizes the subspace topology among all the possible topologies on a subset. Recall that if S is a subset of X , then ÃS W S ,! X denotes the inclusion map of S into X (see Appendix A).
Theorem 3.8 (Characteristic Property of the Subspace Topology). Suppose X is a topological space and S Â X is a subspace. For any topological space Y , a map f W Y ! S is continuous if and only if the composite map Ã S ı f W Y ! X is continuous:
X ÃS ı f 6
ÃS
[
Y - S: f
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that ÃS ı f W Y ! X is continuous. If U is any open subset of S , there is an open subset V Â X such that U D S \ V D ÃS1.V /. Thus
f 1.U / D f 1.ÃS1.V // D .ÃS ı f / 1.V /;
which is open in Y by our continuity assumption. This proves that f is continuous. Conversely, suppose that f is continuous. For any open subset V Â X , we have

52

.ÃS ı f / 1.V / D f 1 ÃS1.V / D f 1.S \ V /; which is open in Y because S \ V is open in S , so ÃS ı f is continuous as well. ut

The characteristic property has a number of useful corollaries. The ﬁrst is quite simple, and in fact could be proved easily without reference to Theorem 3.8, but it is useful to know that it follows directly from the characteristic property.

Corollary 3.9. If S is a subspace of the topological space X , the inclusion map ÃS W S ,! X is continuous.

Proof. The following diagram commutes:

Because the identity is always continuous, the characteristic property implies that

ÃS is also continuous.

One of the most common uses of the characteristic property is to show that the continuity of a map is not affected by restricting or expanding its codomain, or by restricting its domain. (Of course, the domain cannot be expanded without providing an extended deﬁnition of the map, which may or may not be continuous.) The precise statements are given in the next corollary.

Corollary 3.10. Let X and Y be topological spaces, and suppose f W X ! Y is continuous.
(a) RESTRICTING THE DOMAIN: The restriction of f to any subspace S Â X is continuous.
(b) RESTRICTING THE CODOMAIN: If T is a subspace of Y that contains f .X /, then f W X ! T is continuous.
(c) EXPANDING THE CODOMAIN: If Y is a subspace of Z, then f W X ! Z is continuous.

Proof. Part (a) follows from Corollary 3.9, because f j S D f ı ÃS . Part (b) follows

from the characteristic property applied to the subspace T of Y , and part (c) follows

by composing f with the inclusion Y ,! Z.

ut

Proposition 3.11 (Other Properties of the Subspace Topology). Suppose S is a subspace of the topological space X .
(a) If R Â S is a subspace of S , then R is a subspace of X ; in other words, the subspace topologies that R inherits from S and from X agree.

(b) If B is a basis for the topology of X , then

BS D fB \ S W B 2 Bg

is a basis for the topology of S . (c) If .pi / is a sequence of points in S and p 2 S , then pi ! p in S if and only
pi ! p in X . (d) Every subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff. (e) Every subspace of a ﬁrst countable space is ﬁrst countable. (f ) Every subspace of a second countable space is second countable.

Proof. For part (a), let U Â R be any subset. Assume ﬁrst that U is open in the

subspace topology that R inherits from S . This means U D R \ V for some open

subset V Â S (Fig. 3.3). The fact that V is open in S means that V D W \ S

for some open subset W Â X . Thus U D .W \ S / \ R D W \ R, which is open

in the subspace topology that R inherits from X . Conversely, if U is open in the

subspace topology inherited from X , then U D W \ R for some open set W Â X ;

it follows that U is the intersection with R of the set V D W \ S , which is open in

the subspace topology of S , so U is also open in the subspace topology inherited

from S .

To prove (b), we ﬁrst note that every element of B S is open in S by deﬁnition of

the subspace topology; thus we just have to show that every (relatively) open subset

of S satisﬁes the basis criterion with respect to BS . Let U be an open subset of S . By deﬁnition, this means U D S \ V for some open subset V Â X (Fig. 3.4). Since

B is a basis for X , for every p 2 U there is an element B 2 B such that p 2 B Â V .

It then follows that p 2 B \ S Â U with B \ S 2 BS .

Parts (c)–(f) are left as an exercise.

Topological Embeddings

An injective continuous map that is a homeomorphism onto its image (in the subspace topology) is called a topological embedding (or just an embedding). If f W A ! X is such a map, we can think of the image set f .A/ as a homeomorphic copy of A inside X .

I Exercise 3.13. Let X be a topological space and let S be a subspace of X. Show that
the inclusion map S ,! X is a topological embedding.

Example 3.14. Let F W R ! R2 be the injective continuous map F .s/ D .s; s 2/. Its image is the parabola P deﬁned by the equation y D x 2. Considered as a map from

R to P , F is bijective, and it is continuous by Corollary 3.10(b). It is easy to check that its inverse is given by jP , where W R2 ! R is the projection .x; y/ D x;

since is continuous, its restriction to P is continuous by Corollary 3.10(a). Thus

F is a topological embedding.

//

Example 3.15. Let a W Œ0; 1/ ! C be the map a.s/ D e 2 is. In Exercise 2.28, you showed that a is not a homeomorphism onto its image in the metric topology (which is the same as the subspace topology by Exercise 3.3), so it is an example of a map that is continuous and injective but not an embedding. However, the restriction of a to any interval Œ0; b/ for 0 < b < 1 is an embedding, as is its restriction to .0; 1/. //

As the preceding examples illustrate, a continuous injective map might or might not be an embedding. It is not always easy to tell whether a given map is or is not an embedding. The next proposition gives two sufﬁcient (but not necessary) conditions that are often more straightforward to check.

Proposition 3.16. A continuous injective map that is either open or closed is a topological embedding.

Proof. Suppose X and Y are topological spaces and f W X ! Y is a continuous injective map. Note that f deﬁnes a bijective map from X to f .X /, which is con-

Subspaces

55

tinuous by Corollary 3.10(b). To show that this map is a homeomorphism, it sufﬁces

by Exercise 2.29 to show that f is open or closed as a map from X to f .X /.

Suppose f W X ! Y is an open map, and let A be an open subset of X . Then

f .A/ is open in Y , and it follows from Proposition 3.5(b) that f .A/ is also open in

f .X /. Thus f is open as a map from X to f .X /.

If f is closed, exactly the same argument works with “closed” substituted for

“open” throughout.

ut

I Exercise 3.17. Give an example of a topological embedding that is neither an open
map nor a closed map.

Proposition 3.18. A surjective topological embedding is a homeomorphism. I Exercise 3.19. Prove Proposition 3.18.

We can now produce many examples of manifolds as subspaces of Euclidean spaces. In particular, since the Hausdorff property and second countability are automatically inherited by subspaces thanks to parts (d) and (f) of Proposition 3.11, to show that a subspace of Rn is a manifold we need only verify that it is locally Euclidean.
We begin with a very general construction.
Example 3.20. If U Â Rn is an open subset and f W U ! Rk is any continuous map, the graph of f (Fig. 3.5) is the subset .f / Â RnCk deﬁned by

.f / D f.x; y/ D .x1; : : : ; xn; y1; : : : ; yk/ W x 2 U and y D f .x/g;

with the subspace topology inherited from RnCk. To verify that .f / is a manifold, we show that it is in fact homeomorphic to U . Let ˚ f W U ! RnCk be the continuous injective map
˚f .x/ D .x; f .x//:
Just as in Example 3.14, ˚f deﬁnes a continuous bijection from U onto .f /, and the restriction to .f / of the projection W RnCk ! Rn is a continuous inverse for it; so ˚f is a topological embedding and thus .f / is homeomorphic to U . //

Example 3.21. Our next examples are arguably the most important manifolds of

all, so it is worth taking some time to understand them well. Recall that the unit n-sphere is the set Sn of unit vectors in RnC1. In low dimensions, spheres are easy to visualize: S0 is the two-point discrete space f˙1g Â R; S1 is the unit circle in the plane; and S2 is the familiar spherical surface of radius 1 in R3. To see that Sn

is a manifold, we need to show that each point has a Euclidean neighborhood. The

most straightforward way is to show that each point has a neighborhood in S n that

is

sets U1˙, . . . , Un˙C1 cover Sn. On Ui˙, we can solve the equation jxj D 1 for xi and ﬁnd that x 2 Sn \ Ui˙ if and only if

In other words, the intersection of S n with Ui˙ is the graph of a continuous function, and is therefore locally Euclidean. This proves that S n is an n-manifold.
Here is another useful way to show that Sn is a manifold. Let N D .0; : : : ; 0; 1/ denote the “north pole” in Sn, and deﬁne the stereographic projection to be the map W Sn X fN g ! Rn that sends a point x 2 Sn X fN g to the point u 2 Rn chosen so that U D .u; 0/ is the point in RnC1 where the line through N and x meets the
subspace where xnC1 D 0 (Fig. 3.6). To ﬁnd a formula for , we note that u D .x/
is characterized by the vector equation U N D .x N / for some real number .
This leads to the system of equations

Because this is a continuous inverse for , it follows that S n XfN g is homeomorphic

except N , and the analogous projection from the south pole works in a neighborhood

of N .

Example 3.22. Finally, consider the doughnut surface, which is the surface of revolution D Â R3 obtained by starting with the circle .x 2/2 C z2 D 1 in the xzplane (called the generating circle), and revolving it around the zp-axis (Fig. 3.7). It is characterized by the equation .r 2/2 C z2 D 1, where r D x2 C y2. This
surface can be parametrized by two angles Â (measured around the z-axis from
the xz-plane) and ' (measured around the generating circle from the horizontally
outward direction). It is more convenient for calculations to make the substitutions ' D 2 u and Â D 2 v, and deﬁne a map F W R2 ! D by

This maps the plane onto D. It is not one-to-one, because F .u C k; v C l/ D F .u; v/ for any pair of integers .k; l/. However, F is injective if it is restricted to a small enough neighborhood of any point .u 0; v0/, and a straightforward calculation shows that a local inverse in a neighborhood of .u0; v0/ can be constructed from the formulas

The next lemma turns out to be extremely useful in our investigations of surfaces.

Lemma 3.23 (Gluing Lemma). Let X and Y be topological spaces, and let fA i g
be either an arbitrary open cover of X or a ﬁnite closed cover of X . Suppose that
we are given continuous maps fi W Ai ! Y that agree on overlaps: fi jAi \Aj D fj jAi \Aj . Then there exists a unique continuous map f W X ! Y whose restriction to each Ai is equal to fi .

Subspaces

59

Proof. In either case, it follows from elementary set theory that there exists a unique

map f such that f jAi D fi for each i . If the sets Ai are open, the continuity of f follows immediately from the local criterion for continuity (Proposition 2.19). On

the other hand, suppose fA1; : : : ; Akg is a ﬁnite closed cover of X . To prove that f

is continuous, it sufﬁces to show that the preimage of each closed subset K Â Y is

closed. It is easy to check that for each i , f 1.K/ \ Ai D fi 1.K/, and f 1.K/ is the union of these sets for i D 1; : : : ; k. Since fi 1.K/ is closed in Ai by continuity

of fi , and Ai is closed in X by hypothesis, it follows from Proposition 3.5(a) that

fi 1.K/ is also closed in X . Thus f 1.K/ is the union of ﬁnitely many closed

subsets, and hence closed.

ut

In choosing a topology for a subset S Â X , there are two competing priorities: we would like the inclusion map S ,! X to be continuous (from which it follows by composition that the restriction to S of any continuous map f W X ! Y is continuous); and we would also like continuous maps into X whose images happen to lie in S also to be continuous as maps into S . For the ﬁrst requirement, S needs to have enough open subsets, and for the second it should not have too many. The subspace topology is chosen as the optimal compromise between these requirements.
As we will see several times in this chapter, natural topologies such as the subspace topology can usually be characterized in terms of which maps are continuous with respect to them. This is why the “characteristic property” of the subspace topology (Theorem 3.8) is so named. The next theorem makes this precise.

Theorem 3.24 (Uniqueness of the Subspace Topology). Suppose S is a subset of a topological space X . The subspace topology on S is the unique topology for which the characteristic property holds.

Proof. Suppose we are given an arbitrary topology on S that is known to satisfy the characteristic property. For this proof, let Sg denote the set S with the given topology, and let Ss denote S with the subspace topology. To show that the given topology is equal to the subspace topology, it sufﬁces to show that the identity map of S is a homeomorphism between Sg and Ss, by Exercise 2.21.
First we note that the inclusion map Ss ,! X is continuous by Corollary 3.9. Because the proof of that corollary used only the characteristic property, the same argument shows that the inclusion map Sg ,! X is also continuous.
Now consider the two composite maps

3 New Spaces from Old

Note that Ãg ı Idsg D Ãs, and Ãs ı Idgs D Ãg , both of which we have just shown to be

continuous. Thus, applying the characteristic property to each of the compositions

above, we conclude that both Idsg and its inverse Idgs are continuous. Therefore,

Idsg is a homeomorphism.

Product Spaces

Suppose X1; : : : ; Xn are arbitrary topological spaces. On their Cartesian product

X1

Xn, we deﬁne the product topology to be the topology generated by the

following basis:

B D fU1

Un W Ui is an open subset of Xi , i D 1; : : : ; ng:

I Exercise 3.25. Prove that B is a basis for a topology.

The space X1

Xn endowed with the product topology is called a product

space. The basis subsets of the form U1

Un are called product open subsets.

For example, in the plane R2 D R R, the product topology is generated by sets

of the form I J , where I and J are open subsets of R. A typical such set is an

open rectangle.

I Exercise 3.26. Show that the product topology on Rn D R
metric topology induced by the Euclidean distance function.

R is the same as the

The product topology has its own characteristic property. It relates continuity of a
map into a product space to continuity of its component functions. In the special case of a map from Rm to Rn, this reduces to a familiar result from advanced calculus.

Theorem 3.27 (Characteristic Property of the Product Topology). Suppose

X1

Xn is a product space. For any topological space Y , a map f W Y !

X1

Xn is continuous if and only if each of its component functions f i D i ı f

is continuous, where i W X1

Xn ! Xi is the canonical projection:

show that the preimage of each basis subset U1

Uk is open. A point y 2 Y

is in f 1.U1

Uk/ if and only if fi .y/ 2 Ui for each i , so f 1.U1

Uk/ D f1 1.U1/ \ \ fn 1.Un/. Each of the sets in this intersection is open in Y

by hypothesis, so it follows that f is continuous.

61

Conversely, if f is continuous, choose i between 1 and n and suppose U Â X i is

open. Then f 1.X1

U

but this set is just fi 1.U /, as you can easily check. Thus fi is continuous.

ut

Corollary 3.28. If X1, . . . , Xn are topological spaces, each canonical projection

i W X1

Xn ! Xi is continuous.

I Exercise 3.29. Prove the preceding corollary using only the characteristic property of
the product topology.

Just as in the case of the subspace topology, the product topology is uniquely determined by its characteristic property.

Theorem 3.30 (Uniqueness of the Product Topology). Let X1, . . . , Xn be topo-

logical spaces. The product topology on X 1

Xn is the unique topology that

satisﬁes the characteristic property.

Proof. Suppose that X1

Xn is endowed with some topology that satisﬁes the

characteristic property. Since the proof of Corollary 3.28 uses only the characteristic

property, it follows that the canonical projections i are continuous with respect

to both the product topology and the given topology. Invoking the characteristic

property with Y D X1

Xn in the product topology shows that the identity

map from the product topology to the given topology is continuous, and reversing

the roles of the two topologies shows that its inverse is also continuous. Thus the

two topologies are equal.

ut

Proposition 3.31 (Other Properties of the Product Topology). Let X 1, . . . , Xn be topological spaces.
(a) The product topology is “associative” in the sense that the three topologies on the set X1 X2 X3, obtained by thinking of it as X1 X2 X3, .X1 X2/ X3, or X1 .X2 X3/, are all equal.
(b) For any i 2 f1; : : : ; ng and any points xj 2 Xj , j ¤ i , the map f W Xi ! X1 Xn given by

f .x/ D .x1; : : : ; xi 1; x; xiC1; : : : ; xn/

is a topological embedding of Xi into the product space.

(c) Each canonical projection i W X1

Xk ! Xi is an open map.

(d) If for each i , Bi is a basis for the topology of Xi , then the set

fB1

Bn W Bi 2 Bi g

(e) If Si is a subspace of Xi for i D 1; : : : ; n, then the product topology and the

subspace topology on S1

Sn Â X1

Xn are equal.

(f ) If each Xi is Hausdorff, so is X1

Proposition 3.33. A product of continuous maps is continuous, and a product of homeomorphisms is a homeomorphism.

Proof. Because a map is continuous provided that the preimages of basis open sub-

sets are open, the ﬁrst claim follows from the fact that .f1

fk / 1.U1

Uk/ is just the product of the open subsets f1 1.U1/; : : : ; fk 1.Uk/. The second

claim follows from the ﬁrst, because the inverse of a bijective product map is it-

self a product map.

I Exercise 3.34. Suppose f1; f2 W X ! R are continuous functions. Their pointwise
sum f1 C f2 W X ! R and pointwise product f1f2 W X ! R are real-valued functions
deﬁned by

.f1 C f2/.x/ D f1.x/ C f2.x/; .f1f2/.x/ D f1.x/f2.x/:

Pointwise sums and products of complex-valued functions are deﬁned similarly. Use the characteristic property of the product topology to show that pointwise sums and products of real-valued or complex-valued continuous functions are continuous.

Product spaces provide us with another rich source of examples of manifolds. The key is the following proposition.

A particularly important example of a product manifold is the product T n D

S1

S1 of n copies of S1, which is an n-dimensional manifold called the n-

torus. In particular, the 2-torus is usually just called the torus (plural: tori). Because

S1 is a subspace of R2, T 2 can be considered as a subspace of R4 by Proposition

3.31(e): it is just the set of points .x1; x2; x3; x4/ 2 R4 such that .x1/2 C .x2/2 D 1 and .x3/2 C .x4/2 D 1. As the next proposition shows, T 2 is homeomorphic to a

familiar surface.

Product Spaces

63

Proposition 3.36. The torus T 2 is homeomorphic to the doughnut surface D of Example 3.22.

Proof. The key geometric idea is that both surfaces are parametrized by two angles. For D, the angles are ' D 2 u and Â D 2 v as in (3.3); for T 2, they are the angles
in the two circles. Although one must be cautious using angle functions because
they cannot be deﬁned continuously on a whole circle, with care we can eliminate
the angles altogether and derive formulas that are manifestly continuous. With this in mind, we write x1 D cos Â , x2 D sin Â , x3 D cos ', x4 D sin '. Sub-
stituting into (3.3) suggests deﬁning a map G W T 2 ! D by

G.x1; x2; x3; x4/ D ..2 C x3/x1; .2 C x3/x2; x4/:

This is the restriction of a continuous map and is thus continuous, and a little algebra shows that G maps T 2 into D. To see that it is a homeomorphism, just check that
its inverse is given by

G 1.x; y; z/ D .x=r; y=r; r 2; z/;

p

where r D x2 C y2 as in Example 3.22.

Inﬁnite Products
We conclude this section with some brief remarks about products of inﬁnitely many spaces. We do not need to use them in our study of manifolds, but for completeness we show here how the product topology is constructed in the inﬁnite case.Q
Let .X˛/˛2A be an indexed family of topological spaces, and let X D ˛2A X˛ denote their Cartesian product (considered just as a set, for the time being). The most obvious way to generalize the product topology to a product of inﬁnitely mQany sets would be to deﬁne a basis B0 consisting of all product sets of the form ˛2A U˛, where U˛ is an open subset of X˛ for each ˛. This is indeed a basis for a topology, as you can easily check; the topology it generates is called the box topology on X . However, in general this topology turns out not to satisfy the characteristic property of the product topology (see Corollary 3.39 below and Problem 3-8), so it is not the best topology to use for most purposes.
Instead, the product topology on X is deﬁned to be the topQology generated by the smaller basis B consisting of all product sets of the form ˛2A U˛, where U˛ is open in X˛ for each ˛, and U˛ D X˛ for all but ﬁnitely many ˛. Once again, checking that this is indeed a basis for a topology is easy. The product topology is equal to the box topology when the index set is ﬁnite (or, more generally, when the spaces X˛ have the trivial topology for all but ﬁnitely many indices ˛), but in aQll other cases the two topologies are distinct, because any nonempty product set ˛2A U˛ 2 B0 for which U˛ ¤ X˛ for inﬁnitely many indices is not open in the product topology. Just as with ﬁnite products, we always consider a product

64

3 New Spaces from Old

of topological spaces to be endowed with the product topology unless otherwise speciﬁed.

Theorem 3.37 (Characteristic Property of Inﬁnite Product Spaces). Let .X ˛/˛2A be an indQexed family of topological spaces. For any topological space Y , a map f W Y ! ˛2A X˛ is continuous if and only if each of its component fuQnctions f ˛ D
˛ ı f is continuous. The product topology is the unique topology on ˛2A X˛ that satisﬁes this property.
I Exercise 3.38. Prove the preceding theorem.

Corollary 3.39. If .X˛/˛2A is an indexed family of nonempty topological spaces withQinﬁnitely many indices such that X˛ is not a trivial space, then the box topology on ˛2A X˛ does not satisfy the characteristic property.

Proof. As we remarked above, under the hypotheses of the corollary, the box topol-

ogy is not equal to the product topology. The result follows from the uniqueness

statement of Theorem 3.37.

ut

More details on inﬁnite product spaces can be found in [Sie92] or [Mun00].

Disjoint Union Spaces

Our next construction is a way to start with an arbitrary family of topological spaces

and form, in a canonical way, a new space that contains each of the original spaces

as a subspace.

Suppose .X˛/˛2A is an indexed`family of nonempty topological spaces. Recall

that their disjoint union is the set ˛2A X˛ consisting of all ordered pairs .x; ˛/

with ˛ 2 A and x 2`X˛ (see Appendix A). For each ˛ 2 A, there is a canonical

injection Ã˛ W X˛ ! ˛2A X˛ given by Ã˛.x/ D .x; ˛/, and we usually identify each

set X˛ with its image X˛ D Ã˛.X˛/.

`

We deﬁne the disjoint union topology on ˛2A X˛ by declaring a subset of the

disjoint union to be open if and only if its intersection with each set X ˛`(considered

as a subset of the disjoint union) is open in X˛. With this topology, ˛2A X˛ is

called a disjoint union space.

I Exercise 3.40. Show that the disjoint union topology is indeed a topology.

Theorem 3.41 (Characteristic Property of Disjoint Union Spaces). Suppose that
.X˛/˛2A is`an indexed family of topological spaces, and Y is any topological space. A map f W ˛2A X˛ ! Y is continuous if and only if its restriction`to each X˛ is continuous. The disjoint union topology is the unique topology on ˛2A X˛ with this property.

Proof. Problem 3-10.

Proposition 3.42 (Other Properties of Disjoint Union Spaces). Let .X ˛/˛2A be

an indexed family of topological spaces.

` (a) A subset of ˛2A X˛ is closed if and only if its intersection with each X˛ is

closed.

`

(b) Each canonical injection Ã˛ W X˛ ! ˛2A X˛ is a topological embedding and

an open and closed map.

`

(c) If each X˛ is Hausdorff, then so is ˛2`A X˛.

(d) If each X˛ is ﬁrst countable, then so is ˛2A X˛.

`

(e) If each X˛ is second countable and the index set A is countable, then ˛2A X˛

is second countable.

I Exercise 3.43. Prove Proposition 3.42.

I Exercise 3.44. Suppose `.X˛/˛2A is an indexed family of nonempty n-manifolds.
Show that the disjoint union ˛2A X˛ is an n-manifold if and only if A is countable.
I Exercise 3.45. Let X be any space and Y `be a discrete space. Show that the Cartesian
product X Y is equal to the disjoint union y2Y X , and the product topology is the same as the disjoint union topology.

Quotient Spaces
Our last technique for constructing new topological spaces from old ones is somewhat more involved than the preceding ones. It provides us with a way to identify some points in a given topological space with each other, to obtain a new, smaller space. This construction plays an important role in “cutting and pasting” arguments that can be used to deﬁne many manifolds.
Let X be a topological space, Y be any set, and q W X ! Y be a surjective map. Deﬁne a topology on Y by declaring a subset U Â Y to be open if and only if q 1.U / is open in X . This is called the quotient topology induced by the map q.
I Exercise 3.46. Show that the quotient topology is indeed a topology.
If X and Y are topological spaces, a map q W X ! Y is called a quotient map if it is surjective and Y has the quotient topology induced by q. Once q is known to be surjective, to say it is a quotient map is the same as saying that V is open in Y if and only if q 1.V / is open in X . It is immediate from the deﬁnition that every quotient map is continuous.
The most common application of the quotient topology is in the following construction. Let be an equivalence relation on a topological space X (see Appendix A). For each p 2 X , let Œp denote the equivalence class of p, and let X= denote the set of equivalence classes. This is a partition of X : that is, a decomposition of X into a collection of disjoint nonempty subsets whose union is X . Let q W X ! X= be the natural projection sending each element of X to its equivalence class. Then

66

Fig. 3.8: A quotient of Bx2.

Fig. 3.9: A quotient of I I .

X= together with the quotient topology induced by q is called the quotient space (or sometimes identiﬁcation space) of X by the given equivalence relation.
Alternatively, a quotient space can be deﬁned by explicitly giving a partition of X . Whether a given quotient space is deﬁned in terms of an equivalence relation or a partition is a matter of convenience.
Because quotient spaces are probably less familiar to you than subspaces or products, we introduce a number of examples before going any further.

Example 3.47. Let I D Œ0; 1 Â R be the unit interval, and let be the equivalence

relation on I generated by the single relation 0 1: this means x y if and only

if either x D y or fx; yg D f0; 1g. You can think of this space as being obtained

from the unit interval by “attaching its endpoints together.” It is probably intuitively

evident that the quotient space I = is homeomorphic to the circle S 1. This can be

proved directly from the deﬁnition, but the argument is rather involved (try it!). Later

in this section and in the next chapter, we will develop some simple but powerful

tools that will make such proofs easy. (See Examples 3.76 and 4.51.)

//

Example 3.48. Let Bx2 be the closed unit disk in R2, and let be the equivalence

relation on Bx2 generated by .x; y/ . x; y/ for all .x; y/ 2 @B2 (Fig. 3.8). (You

can think of this space as being obtained from Bx2 by “pasting” the left half of the

boundary to the right half.) We will prove in Chapter 6 that Bx2= is homeomorphic

to S2.

//

Example 3.49. Deﬁne an equivalence relation on the square I I by setting .x; 0/

.x; 1/ for all x 2 I , and .0; y/ .1; y/ for all y 2 I (Fig. 3.9). This can be visual-

ized as the space obtained by pasting the top boundary segment of the square to the

bottom to form a cylinder, and then pasting the left-hand boundary circle of the re-

sulting cylinder to the right-hand one. Later we will prove that the resulting quotient

space is homeomorphic to the torus (see Example 4.52).

//

Example 3.50. Deﬁne an equivalence relation on R by declaring x y if x and y

differ by an integer. We will show below that the resulting quotient space is homeo-

morphic to the circle.

//

Example 3.51. Deﬁne P n, the real projective space of dimension n, to be the set of 1-dimensional linear subspaces (lines through the origin) in R nC1. There is a natural

Quotient Spaces

map q W RnC1 X f0g ! P n deﬁned by sending a point x to its span. We topologize P n by giving it the quotient topology with respect to this map. The 2-dimensional projective space P 2 is usually called the projective plane. It was originally intro-

duced as a tool for analyzing perspective in painting and drawing, because each

point on an artist’s canvas represents the light traveling along one line through a

ﬁxed origin (the artist’s eye).

Projective space can also be viewed in another way. If we deﬁne an equivalence relation on RnC1 X f0g by declaring two points x; y to be equivalent if x D y for some nonzero real number , then there is an obvious identiﬁcation between P n and

the set of equivalence classes. Under this identiﬁcation, the map q deﬁned above is

just the map sending a point to its equivalence class.

//

Example 3.52. Let X be any topological space, and let A be any subset of X . Let

be the equivalence relation on X generated by all relations of the form a 1 a2 for a1; a2 2 A; the partition associated with this relation is the collection of singletons fxg for x 2 X X A, together with the single set A. The quotient space determined by

this relation is denoted by X=A. Because A projects to a single point in the quotient

space, such a space is said to be obtained by collapsing A to a point. For example,

we will see in the next chapter (Example 4.55) that the space Bxn=Sn 1, obtained by

collapsing the boundary of Bxn to a point, is homeomorphic to S n.

//

Example 3.53. If X is any topological space, the quotient .X I /=.X f0g/ ob-

tained from the “cylinder” X I by collapsing one end to a point is called the cone

on X , and is denoted by CX (Fig. 3.10). For example, it is easy to see geometrically

(and we will prove it in Example 4.56) that C S n is homeomorphic to Bn.

//

Example 3.54. Let X1; : : : ; Xk be nonempty topological spaces. For each i , let p i be a speciﬁc point in Xi ; a choice of such a point is called a base point for Xi . The wedge sum of the spaces X1; : : : ; Xk determined by the chosen base points, denoted by X1 _ _Xk, is the quotient space obtained from the disjoint union X 1 q qXk by collapsing the set fp1; : : : ; pkg to a point. More generally, if .X˛/˛2A is an indexed family ofWnonempty spaces and p ˛ is a choice o`f base point for X˛, we deﬁne the wedge sum ˛2A X˛ similarly as the quotient of ˛2A X˛ obtained by collapsing fp˛g˛2A to a point. In other words, we glue the spaces together by identifying all their base points to a single point, while considering the spaces otherwise dis-
joint. The wedge sum is also called the one-point union. For example, the wedge

68

sum R _ R is homeomorphic to the union of the x-axis and the y-axis in the plane

(Fig. 3.11), and the wedge sum S 1 _ S1 is homeomorphic to the ﬁgure-eight space

consisting of the union of the two circles of radius 1 centered at .0; 1/ and .0; 1/

in the plane (Fig. 3.12). A wedge sum of ﬁnitely many copies of S 1 is sometimes

called a bouquet of circles.

//

I Exercise 3.55. Show that every wedge sum of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff.

Unlike subspaces and product spaces, quotient spaces do not behave well with respect to most topological properties. In particular, none of the deﬁning properties of manifolds (locally Euclidean, Hausdorff, second countable) are automatically inherited by quotient spaces. In the problems, you will see how to construct a quotient space of a manifold that is locally Euclidean and second countable but not Hausdorff (Problem 3-16), one that is Hausdorff and second countable but not locally Euclidean (Problem 4-5), and one that is not even ﬁrst countable (Problem 3-18).
If we wish to prove that a given quotient space is a manifold, we have to prove at least that it is locally Euclidean and Hausdorff. The following proposition shows that in many cases this is sufﬁcient.

Proposition 3.56. Suppose P is a second countable space and M is a quotient space of P . If M is locally Euclidean, then it is second countable. Thus if M is locally Euclidean and Hausdorff, it is a manifold.

Proof. Let coordinate

let U 0 Â U denote a countable then U0 is a countable cover of

subset M by

coordinate balls. Each such ball is second countable, so M is second countable by

the result of Problem 2-19.

ut

Typically, to prove that a given quotient space is Hausdorff, one has to resort to the deﬁnition. For open quotient maps, however, we have the following criterion.

Proposition 3.57. Suppose q W X ! Y is an open quotient map. Then Y is Hausdorff if and only if the set R D f.x1; x2/ W q.x1/ D q.x2/g is closed in X X .

Quotient Spaces

69

Proof. First assume Y is Hausdorff. If .x1; x2/ … R, then there are disjoint neighborhoods V1 of q.x1/ and V2 of q.x2/, and it follows that q 1.V1/ q 1.V2/ is a

neighborhood of .x1; x2/ that is disjoint from R. Thus R is closed. (This implica-

tion does not require the assumption that q is open.)

Conversely, assume R is closed. Given distinct points y1; y2 2 Y , choose x1; x2 2

X such that q.xi / D yi . Because .x1; x2/ … R, there is a product neighborhood

U1 U2 of .x1; x2/ in X X that is disjoint from R. Since q is open, q.U1/ and

q.U2/ are disjoint neighborhoods of y1 and y2, respectively.

ut

The proposition has a convenient restatement in the case of a quotient space determined by an equivalence relation; its proof is immediate.

Corollary 3.58. Suppose is an equivalence relation on a space X . If the quotient

map X ! X= is an open map, then X= is Hausdorff if and only if is a closed

subset of X X .

ut

As Problem 3-17 shows, the assumption that the quotient map is open cannot be removed in Proposition 3.57 or its corollary. (But see also Theorem 4.57, which gives another class of quotient maps for which closedness of R is equivalent to having a Hausdorff quotient.)

Recognizing Quotient Maps Between Known Spaces
Now we change our perspective somewhat: let us assume that X and Y are both topological spaces, and explore conditions under which a map q W X ! Y is a quotient map.
Suppose q W X ! Y is a map. Any subset of the form q 1.y/ Â X for some y 2 Y is called a ﬁber of q. A subset U Â X is said to be saturated with respect to q if U D q 1.V / for some subset V Â Y .
I Exercise 3.59. Let q W X ! Y be any map. For a subset U Â X, show that the fol-
lowing are equivalent.
(a) U is saturated. (b) U D q 1.q.U //. (c) U is a union of ﬁbers. (d) If x 2 U , then every point x0 2 X such that q.x/ D q.x0/ is also in U .
Although quotient maps do not always take open subsets to open subsets, there is a useful alternative characterization of quotient maps in terms of saturated open or closed subsets.
Proposition 3.60. A continuous surjective map q W X ! Y is a quotient map if and only if it takes saturated open subsets to open subsets, or saturated closed subsets to closed subsets.
I Exercise 3.61. Prove Proposition 3.60.

70

3 New Spaces from Old

Proposition 3.62 (Properties of Quotient Maps).

(a) Any composition of quotient maps is a quotient map. (b) An injective quotient map is a homeomorphism. (c) If q W X ! Y is a quotient map, a subset K Â Y is closed if and only if q 1.K/
is closed in X . (d) If q W X ! Y is a quotient map and U Â X is a saturated open or closed subset,
then the restriction qjU W U ! q.U / is a quotient map. (e) If fq`˛ W X˛ !`Y˛g˛2A is an indexed family of quotient maps, then the map
q W ˛ X˛ ! ˛ Y˛ whose restriction to each X˛ is equal to q˛ is a quotient map.
I Exercise 3.63. Prove Proposition 3.62.

Here are some examples.

Example 3.64. Consider the map q W RnC1 X f0g ! Sn deﬁned by q.x/ D x=jxj.

Observe that q is continuous and surjective, and the ﬁbers of q are open rays in

RnC1 X f0g. Thus the saturated sets are the unions of open rays, and it is easy to

check that q takes saturated open subsets to open subsets and is therefore a quotient

map.

//

Example 3.65. Recall the construction of the cone on a topological space X from

Example 3.53. The set X f1g is a saturated closed subset of X I , so the quotient

map X I ! CX restricts to a quotient map from X f1g onto its image. If we

denote this image by X , then the composite map X X f1g ! X is an injective

quotient map and therefore a homeomorphism. One typically identiﬁes X with its

homeomorphic image X Â CX , thus considering X as a subspace of CX .

//

Example 3.66. Consider the map ! W I ! S1 that wraps the interval once around the circle at constant speed, given (in complex notation) by !.s/ D e 2 is. This
map is continuous and surjective. To show that it is a quotient map, let U Â S 1 be arbitrary; we need to show that U is open if and only if ! 1.U / is open. If U is open, then ! 1.U / is open by continuity. Conversely, suppose ! 1.U / is open, and

let z be a point in U . If z ¤ 1, then z D !.s0/ for a unique s0 2 .0; 1/, and there is some " > 0 such that .s0 "; s0 C "/ Â ! 1.U /. If z D 1, then both 0 and 1 are in ! 1.z/, so there is some " > 0 such that Œ0; "/ [ .1 "; 1 Â ! 1.U /. In either case,

it follows that U contains a set of the form S1 \ W , where W is an open “wedge”

described in polar coordinates by s0 " < Â < s0 C ". It follows that U is open, and

thus ! is a quotient map.

On the other hand, if we restrict ! to Œ0; 1/, it is still surjective and continuous,

but

because

//

As the preceding example illustrates, it is not always a simple matter to determine whether a surjective continuous map is a quotient map. The following proposition gives two very useful sufﬁcient (but not necessary) conditions.

Quotient Spaces

71

Proposition 3.67. If q W X ! Y is a surjective continuous map that is also an open or closed map, then it is a quotient map.

Proof. If q is open, it takes saturated open subsets to open subsets (because it takes

all open subsets to open subsets). If q is closed, it takes saturated closed subsets to

closed subsets. In either case, it is a quotient map by Proposition 3.60.

ut

Example 3.68. If X1; : : : ; Xk are topological spaces, then each canonical projection

i W X1

Xk ! Xi is a quotient map, because it is continuous, surjective, and

open.

//

We have now seen three results (Exercise 2.29 and Propositions 3.16 and 3.67) in which a map that is open or closed is shown to have some other desirable property. The next proposition summarizes these results.

Proposition 3.69. Suppose X and Y are topological spaces, and f W X ! Y is a continuous map that is either open or closed.

(a) If f is injective, it is a topological embedding.

(b) If f is surjective, it is a quotient map.

(c) If f is bijective, it is a homeomorphism.

ut

The Characteristic Property and Uniqueness

Next we come to the characteristic property of the quotient topology. This characteristic property turns out to be even more important than those of the subspace, product, and disjoint union topologies.

Theorem 3.70 (Characteristic Property of the Quotient Topology). Suppose X

and Y are topological spaces and q W X ! Y is a quotient map. For any topological

space Z, a map f W Y ! Z is continuous if and only if the composite map f ı q is

continuous: X

f ıq

q ?

-

Y - Z:

f

Proof. This result follows immediately from the fact that for any open subset U Â

Z, f 1.U / is open in Y if and only if q 1 f 1.U / D .f ı q/ 1.U / is open in

X.

ut

Theorem 3.71 (Uniqueness of the Quotient Topology). Given a topological space X , a set Y , and a surjective map q W X ! Y , the quotient topology is the only topology on Y for which the characteristic property holds.

I Exercise 3.72. Prove the preceding theorem.

72

3 New Spaces from Old

The next theorem is by far the most important consequence of the characteristic property. It tells us how to deﬁne continuous maps out of a quotient space.

Theorem 3.73 (Passing to the Quotient). Suppose q W X ! Y is a quotient map,
Z is a topological space, and f W X ! Z is any continuous map that is constant on the ﬁbers of q (i.e., if q.x/ D q.x0/, then f .x/ D f .x0/). Then there exists a unique continuous map fzW Y ! Z such that f D fzı q:

X

q ?

f -

Y - Z:

fz

Proof. The existence and uniqueness of fz follow from elementary set theory: given

y 2 Y , there is some x 2 X such that q.x/ D y, and we can set fz.y/ D f .x/ for

any such x. The hypothesis on f guarantees that fz is unique and well deﬁned.

Continuity of fz is then immediate from the characteristic property.

ut

In the situation of the preceding theorem, we say that f passes to the quotient or descends to the quotient. The proof shows that the map fz can be written explicitly as fz.q.x// D f .x/, or in the case of a quotient space determined by an equivalence relation, fz.Œx/ D f .x/.

Example 3.74. Let S be the quotient space of R determined by the equivalence

relation of Example 3.50: x y if and only if x y 2 Z. Suppose f W R ! X is a

continuous map that is 1-periodic, meaning that f .x/ D f .x C 1/ for all x 2 R. It

follows easily by induction that f .x/ D f .y/ whenever x y 2 Z, so f descends

to a continuous map fzW S ! X .

//

The next consequence of the characteristic property says that quotient spaces are uniquely determined up to homeomorphism by the identiﬁcations made by their quotient maps.

Theorem 3.75 (Uniqueness of Quotient Spaces). Suppose q1 W X ! Y1 and q2 W X ! Y2 are quotient maps that make the same identiﬁcations (i.e., q 1.x/ D q1.x0/ if and only if q2.x/ D q2.x0/). Then there is a unique homeomorphism ' W Y1 ! Y2 such that ' ı q1 D q2.
Proof. By Theorem 3.73, both q1 and q2 pass uniquely to the quotient as in the following diagrams:

X

q1 ?

q2 -

Y1 - Y2;

qz2

X

q2 ?

q1 -

Y2 - Y1:

qz1

Adjunction Spaces

73

Since both of these diagrams commute, it follows that

qz1 ı .qz2 ı q1/ D qz1 ı q2 D q1:

(3.4)

Consider another diagram: X

q1 ?
Y1

q1 -
- Y1:

If the dashed arrow is interpreted as qz1 ı qz2, then (3.4) shows that the diagram commutes; it also obviously commutes when the dashed arrow is interpreted as the iden-

tity map of Y1. By the uniqueness part of Theorem 3.73, therefore, these maps must

be equal. Similarly, qz2 ı qz1 is equal to the identity on Y2. Thus ' D qz2 is the re-

quired homeomorphism, and it is the unique such map by the uniqueness statement

of Theorem 3.73.

ut

The preceding theorem is extraordinarily useful for showing that a given quotient space is homeomorphic to a known space. Here is one illustration of the technique.

Example 3.76. To show that the quotient space I = of Example 3.47 is homeomorphic to the circle, all we need to do is exhibit a quotient map ! W I ! S 1 that makes
the same identiﬁcations as . The map described in Example 3.66 is such a map. //

The only difﬁcult part of the preceding proof was the argument in Example 3.66 showing that ! is a quotient map. In the next chapter, we will introduce a simple but powerful result (the closed map lemma) that will enable us to bypass most such arguments. (See Example 4.51.)

Adjunction Spaces
The theory of quotient spaces gives us a handy way to construct a new topological space by “attaching” one space onto another. Suppose X and Y are topological spaces, A is a closed subspace of Y , and f W A ! X is a continuous map. Let be the equivalence relation on the disjoint union X q Y generated by a f .a/ for all a 2 A, and denote the resulting quotient space by
X [f Y D .X q Y /= :
Any such quotient space is called an adjunction space, and is said to be formed by attaching Y to X along f . The map f is called the attaching map. Note that the equivalence relation identiﬁes each point x 2 X with all of the points (if any) in f 1.x/ Â A. If A D ¿, then X [f Y is just the disjoint union space X q Y .
Proposition 3.77 (Properties of Adjunction Spaces). Let X [f Y be an adjunction space, and let q W X q Y ! X [f Y be the associated quotient map.

74

(a) The restriction of q to X is a topological embedding, whose image set q.X / is a closed subspace of X [f Y .
(b) The restriction of q to Y X A is a topological embedding, whose image set q.Y X A/ is an open subspace of X [f Y .
(c) X [f Y is the disjoint union of q.X / and q.Y X A/.

Proof. We begin by showing that qjX is a closed map. Suppose that B is a closed

subset of X . To show that q.B/ is closed in the quotient space, we need to show that q 1.q.B// is closed in X q Y , which is equivalent to showing that its intersections

with X and Y are closed in X and Y , respectively. From the form of the equivalence

relation, it follows that q 1.q.B// \ X D B, which is closed in X by assumption; and q 1.q.B// \ Y D f 1.B/, which is closed in A by the continuity of f , and

thus is closed in Y because A is closed in Y . It follows, in particular, that q.X / is

closed in X [f Y . Now qjX is clearly injective because the equivalence relation does not identify

any points in X with each other. Because it is also closed, it is a topological embed-

ding by Proposition 3.69. This proves (a).

To prove (b), we just note that Y X A is a saturated open subset of X q Y , so

the restriction qjY XA W Y X A ! q.Y X A/ is a quotient map by Proposition 3.62(d), and since it is bijective it is a homeomorphism. Its image is open in X [ f Y by

deﬁnition of the quotient topology.

Finally, part (c) is an easy consequence of the deﬁnition of the equivalence rela-

tion.

ut

Because of the preceding proposition, one typically identiﬁes X with q.X / and Y X A with q.Y X A/, considering each as a subspace of the adjunction space.

Example 3.78 (Adjunction Spaces).

(a) Suppose X and Y are topological spaces with chosen base points x 2 X and

y 2 Y . Let A D fyg Â Y , and deﬁne f W A ! X by f .y/ D x. Then the ad-

junction space X [f Y is just the wedge sum X _ Y (Example 3.54). (b) Let A D S1 Â Bx2, and let f W A ,! Bx2 be the inclusion map. Then the ad-
junction space Bx2 [f Bx2 is homeomorphic to S2, as you can check using the

techniques of the previous section.

The adjunction space construction is particularly important as a tool for constructing manifolds. Suppose M and N are n-dimensional manifolds with nonempty boundaries, such that @M and @N are homeomorphic. Let h W @N ! @M be a homeomorphism. Assuming the theorem on the invariance of the boundary, we conclude from Corollary 2.60 that @N is a closed subset of N , so we can deﬁne the adjunction space M [h N (considering h as a map into M ). This space is said to be formed by attaching M and N together along their boundaries.

Theorem 3.79 (Attaching Manifolds along Their Boundaries). With M , N , and
h as above, M [h N is an n-manifold (without boundary). There are topological embeddings e W M ! M [h N and f W N ! M [h N whose images are closed subsets of M [h N satisfying

Proof. First we need to show that M [h N is locally Euclidean of dimension n. Let q W M q N ! M [h N denote the quotient map, and write S D q.@M [ @N /. Note that Int M q Int N is a saturated open subset of M q N , and therefore q restricts
to a quotient map from Int M q Int N onto .M [h N / X S . Because this restriction is injective, it is a homeomorphism, and thus .M [h N / X S is locally Euclidean of
dimension n. Thus we need only consider points in S .
Suppose s 2 S , and let y 2 @N and x D h.y/ 2 @M be the two points in the ﬁber q 1.s/. We can choose coordinate charts .U; '/ for M and .V; / for N such that x 2 U and y 2 V , and let Uy D '.U /, Vy D .V / Â Hn. It is useful in this proof to identify Hn with Rn 1 Œ0; 1/ and Rn with Rn 1 R. By shrinking U and V if necessary, we may assume that h.V \ @N / D U \ @M , and that Uy D U0 Œ0; "/ and Vy D V0 Œ0; "/ for some " > 0 and some open subsets U0; V0 Â Rn 1 (Fig. 3.13). Then we can write the coordinate maps as '.x/ D .' 0.x/; '1.x// and
.y/ D . 0.y/; 1.y// for some continuous maps '0 W U ! U0, '1 W U ! Œ0; "/, 0 W V ! V0, and 1 W V ! Œ0; "/. Our assumption that x and y are boundary points means that '1.x/ D 1.y/ D 0.
We wish to assemble these two charts into a map whose image is an open subset of Rn, by matching them up along corresponding points in @M and @N . As they
stand, however, the maps ' and might not take corresponding boundary points to
the same image point, so we need to adjust for that. Both of the restrictions

'0jU \@M W U \ @M ! U0;

0jV \@N W V \ @N ! V0

are homeomorphisms. Deﬁne a homeomorphism ˇ W V 0 ! U0 by

76

ˇ D '0jU \@M ı h ı 0jV \@N 1;

and let B W Vy ! Rn be the map

B.x1; : : : ; xn/ D ˇ.x1; : : : ; xn 1/; xn/:

Geometrically, B rearranges the boundary points according to the map ˇ, and then “ﬂips” each vertical line segment above a boundary point to a line segment below the image point. Our construction ensures that for y 2 V \ @N ,

B ı .y/ D .ˇ ı 0.y/; 0/ D .'0 ı h.y/; 0/ D ' ı h.y/:

(3.5)

Now deﬁne ˚z W U q V ! Rn by
( ˚z.y/ D '.y/;
B ı .y/;

y 2 U; y 2 V:

Because U q V is a saturated open subset of M q N , the restriction of q to it is a quotient map onto the neighborhood q.U q V / of s, and (3.5) shows that ˚z passes

to the quotient and deﬁnes an injective continuous map ˚ W q.U q V / ! R n. Since

', , and B are homeomorphisms onto their images, we can deﬁne an inverse for

˚ as follows:

(

˚ 1.y/ D

q ı ' 1.y/; q ı 1 ı B 1.y/;

yn 0; yn Ä 0:

These two deﬁnitions agree where they overlap, so the resulting map is continu-

ous by the gluing lemma. Thus ˚ is a homeomorphism, and M [ h N is locally

Euclidean of dimension n.

The quotient space M [h N is second countable by Proposition 3.56. To prove

that it is Hausdorff, we need to show that the ﬁbers of q can be separated by sat-

urated open subsets. It is straightforward to check on a case-by-case basis that the

preimages of sufﬁciently small coordinate balls will do.

It follows immediately from Proposition 3.77(a) that the quotient map q restricts

to a topological embedding of N into M [h N with closed image. On the other

hand, because h is a homeomorphism, it is easy to see that M [h N is also equal to

N [h 1 M , so q also restricts to a topological embedding of M with closed image.

The union of the images of these embeddings is all of M [ h N , and their intersection

is the set S deﬁned above, which is exactly the image of either boundary.

ut

Here is an important example of the preceding construction.

Example 3.80 (The Double of a Manifold with Boundary). Suppose M is an n-

dimensional manifold with boundary. If h W @M ! @M is the identity map, the re-

sulting quotient space M [h M is denoted by D.M / and called the double of M . It can be visualized as the space obtained by attaching two copies of M to each other

along their common boundary. (If @M D ¿, then D.M / is just the disjoint union of

two copies of M .)

The following proposition is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.79.

Proposition 3.81. Every n-manifold with boundary is homeomorphic to a closed

subset of an n-manifold without boundary.

ut

This construction can be used to extend many results about manifolds to manifolds with boundary. For example, any property that holds for all closed subsets of manifolds is also shared by manifolds with boundary.

Topological Groups and Group Actions

When we combine the topological concepts introduced in this chapter with a little group theory, we obtain a rich source of interesting topological spaces. A topological group is a group G endowed with a topology such that the maps m W G G ! G and i W G ! G given by

m.g1; g2/ D g1g2; i.g/ D g 1

are continuous, where the product and inverse are those of the group structure of G. (Of course, continuity of m is understood to be with respect to the product topology on G G.)

Example 3.82 (Topological Groups). Each of the following is a topological group:

the real line R with its additive group structure and Euclidean topology

the set R D R X f0g of nonzero real numbers under multiplication, with the

Euclidean topology

the set C D C X f0g of nonzero complex numbers under complex multiplica-

tion, with the Euclidean topology

the general linear group GL.n; R/, which is the set of n n invertible real ma-

trices under matrix multiplication, with the subspace topology obtained from

Rn2 (where we identify an n n matrix with a point in Rn2 by using the matrix

entries as coordinates)

the complex general linear group GL.n; C/, the set of n n invertible complex

matrices under matrix multiplication

any group whatsoever, with the discrete topology (any such group is called a

discrete group)

//

I Exercise 3.83. Verify that each of the above examples is a topological group. For the
real and complex general linear groups, you will need to recall or look up Cramer’s rule.

Proposition 3.84. Any subgroup of a topological group is a topological group with the subspace topology. Any ﬁnite product of topological groups is a topological group with the direct product group structure and the product topology.
I Exercise 3.85. Prove Proposition 3.84.

If G is a topological group and g 2 G, left translation by g is the map L g W G ! G deﬁned by Lg .g0/ D gg0. It is continuous, because it is equal to the composition

G !ig G G !m G;

where ig .g0/ D .g; g0/ and m is group multiplication. Because Lg ı Lg 1 D IdG, left translation by any element of g is a homeomorphism of G. Similarly, right translation by g, Rg .g0/ D g0g, is also a homeomorphism.
A topological space X is said to be topologically homogeneous if for any x; y 2 X , there is a homeomorphism ' W X ! X taking x to y. Intuitively, this
means that X “looks the same” from the vantage of any point. Every topological group G is topologically homogeneous, because for any g; g 0 2 G, the left translation Lg0g 1 is a homeomorphism of G taking g to g 0. This implies, in particular, that many topological spaces cannot be given the structure of a topological group. For example, if X is the union of the x-axis and the y-axis in R 2, and we accept
the fact (which will be proved in the next chapter) that the origin has no locally
Euclidean neighborhood in X , then it follows that X has no group structure making
it into a topological group.

Group Actions

Our next construction is a far-reaching generalization of Examples 3.50 and 3.51. Suppose G is a group (not necessarily a topological group for now), and X is a
set. A left action of G on X is a map G X ! X , written .g; x/ 7! g x, with the following properties:

(i) g1 .g2 x/ D .g1g2/ x for all x 2 X and all g1; g2 2 G. (ii) 1 x D x for all x 2 X .

Similarly, a right action is a map X G ! X , written .x; g/ 7! x g, with the same

properties except that composition works in reverse: .x g1/ g2 D x .g1g2/.

Any right action determines a left action in a canonical way, and vice versa, by

the correspondence

g x D x g 1:

Topological Groups and Group Actions

79

Thus for many purposes, the choice of left or right action is a matter of taste. We usually choose to focus on left actions because the composition law mimics composition of functions, and unless we specify otherwise, groups will always be understood to act on the left. However, we will see some situations in which an action appears naturally as a right action.
Now, suppose X is a topological space and G is a group acting on X . (Let us say for deﬁniteness that it acts on the left.) The action is called an action by homeomorphisms if for each g 2 G, the map x 7! g x is a homeomorphism of X . If in addition G is a topological group, the action is said to be continuous if the map G X ! X is continuous. The next proposition explains the relationship between the two concepts.

Proposition 3.87. Suppose G is a topological group acting on a topological space X.
(a) If the action is continuous, then it is an action by homeomorphisms. (b) If G has the discrete topology, then the action is continuous if and only if it is
an action by homeomorphisms.

Proof. First suppose the action is continuous. This means, in particular, that for each

g 2 G the map x 7! g x is continuous from X to itself, because it is the composition

x 7! .g; x/ 7! g x. Each such map is a homeomorphism, because the deﬁnition of a group action guarantees that it has a continuous inverse x 7! g 1 x. Thus G acts

by homeomorphisms.

Now, suppose G has the discrete topology. If G acts by homeomorphisms, then

the map G X ! X deﬁned by the action is continuous when restricted to each

subset of the form fgg X . Since these subsets form an open cover of G X , this

implies that the action is continuous.

ut

For any x 2 X , the set G x D fg x W g 2 Gg Â X is called the orbit of x. The action is said to be transitive if for every pair of points x; y 2 X , there is a group element g such that g x D y, or equivalently if the orbit of each point is the entire space X . The action is said to be free if the only element of G that ﬁxes any point in X is the identity; that is, if g x D x for some x implies g D 1.

Example 3.88 (Continuous Group Actions).
(a) The general linear group GL.n; R/ acts on the left on R n by matrix multiplication, considering each vector in Rn as a column matrix. The action is continuous, because the component functions of g x are polynomial functions of the components of g and x. Given any nonzero vector x 2 R n, we can ﬁnd vectors x2; : : : ; xn such that .x; x2; : : : ; xn/ is a basis for Rn, and then the matrix g with columns .x; x2; : : : ; xn/ is invertible and takes the vector .1; 0; : : : ; 0/ to x. If y is any other nonzero vector, the same argument shows that there is a matrix h 2 GL.n; R/ taking .1; 0; : : : ; 0/ to y, and then hg 1 takes x to y. Thus there are only two orbits: Rn X f0g and f0g.

(b) The orthogonal group O.n/ acts continuously on R n by matrix multiplication as well; this is just the restriction of the action in part (a) to O.n/ Rn Â GL.n; R/ Rn. Since any unit vector x can be completed to an orthonormal
basis .x; x2; : : : ; xn/, the argument in the preceding paragraph shows that for any two unit vectors x and y there is an an orthogonal matrix taking x to
y. If x and y are any two nonzero vectors with the same length, there is an orthogonal matrix taking x=jxj to y=jyj, and this matrix also takes x to y.
Since multiplication by an orthogonal matrix preserves lengths of vectors, the orbits of the O.n/ action on Rn are f0g and the spheres centered at 0. (c) The restriction of the action of O.n/ to the unit sphere in R n yields a transitive action on Sn 1. (d) The group R acts on Rn X f0g by scalar multiplication. The action is free, and
the orbits are the lines through the origin (with the origin removed).
(e) Any topological group G acts continuously, freely, and transitively on itself on the left by left translation: g g0 D Lg .g0/ D gg0. Similarly, G acts on itself on the right by right translation.
(f) If is a subgroup of the topological group G (with the subspace topology),
then group multiplication on the left or right deﬁnes a left or right action of
on G; it is just the restriction of the action of G on itself to G or G .
This action is continuous and free, but in general not transitive. (g) The two-element discrete group f˙1g acts freely on S n by multiplication:
˙1 x D ˙x. This is an action by homeomorphisms, and because the group is discrete, it is continuous. Each orbit is a pair of antipodal points: fx; xg. //

Given an action of a group G on a space X (not necessarily continuous or even
by homeomorphisms), we deﬁne a relation on X by saying x 1 x2 if there is an element g 2 G such that g x1 D x2. This is reﬂexive because 1 x D x for each x; it is symmetric because g x1 D x2 implies g 1 x2 D x1; and it is transitive because g x1 D x2 and g0 x2 D x3 imply g0g x1 D x3. Thus it is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are precisely the orbits of the group action. The resulting
quotient space is denoted by X=G, and is called the orbit space of the action. If the
action is transitive, the orbit space is a single point, so only nontransitive actions
yield interesting examples.
Let us examine the quotients determined by some of the group actions described
in Example 3.88.

Example 3.89. As we mentioned above, the action of GL.n; R/ on R n by matrix

multiplication has two orbits, so the quotient space has exactly two points: a D

q Rn X f0g and b D q.f0g/. The only saturated open subsets of Rn are Rn, Rn X

f0g, and ¿, so the open subsets of the quotient space are fa; bg, fag, and ¿. This

quotient space is not Hausdorff.

//

Example 3.90. The quotient space of Rn by O.n/ is homeomorphic to Œ0; 1/ (see

Problem 3-24).

//

Example 3.91. The real projective space P n of Example 3.51 is exactly the orbit

space of the action of R on RnC1 X f0g by scalar multiplication.

//

Problems

A particularly important special case arises when G is a topological group and we consider the action of a subgroup Â G on G (Example 3.88(f) above). An orbit of the right action of on G is a set of the form fg W 2 g, which is precisely the left coset g . Thus the orbit space of the right action of on G is the set G= of left cosets with the quotient topology. This quotient space is called the (left) coset space of G by . (It is unfortunate but unavoidable that the right action produces a left coset space and vice versa. If G is abelian, the situation is simpler, because then the left action and right action of are equal to each other.)

Example 3.92. As an application, let us consider the coset space R=Z. Because Z is a subgroup of the topological group R, there is a natural free continuous action of Z on R by translation: n x D n C x. (Because R is abelian, we might as well consider it as a left action.) The orbits are exactly the equivalence classes of the relation deﬁned in Example 3.50 above, x y if and only if x y 2 Z. Thus the quotient space of that example is the same as the coset space R=Z.
Consider also the map " W R ! S1 deﬁned (in complex notation) by
".r/ D e2 ir :

It is straightforward to check that this is a local homeomorphism and thus an open

map, so it is a quotient map. Because it makes the same identiﬁcations as the quo-

tient map R ! R=Z, the uniqueness of quotient spaces tells us that R=Z is homeomorphic to S1. (We will be returning to this map ", which we call the exponential

quotient map, extensively in this book.)

More generally, the discrete subgroup Zn acts freely on Rn by translation. By

similar reasoning, the quotient space Rn=Zn is homeomorphic to the n-torus T n D
