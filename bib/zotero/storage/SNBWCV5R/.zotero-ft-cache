Abstract:
This paper introduces a new vector field guidance method to generate continuously flyable paths for unmanned air vehicles. The central idea of the proposed vector field approach is imbibed in the commanded course angle, which is expressed as a nonlinear function of the position error with respect to the desired path. Considering straight line and circular paths, the asymptotic behavior of position error is shown to converge to zero. Analysis of path curvature establishes a significantly lower maximum value as compared to a popular existing method. Simulation results are presented considering a two-dimensional kinematic model of the vehicle. Overall, the method presents an easily computable path following solution with superior curvature characteristics.

SECTION I.
Introduction

Applications of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have increased rapidly in recent decades, encompassing defense, agriculture, healthcare, and various civilian aspects. These missions often require a UAV to follow predefined paths autonomously. Algorithms used for generating path following guidance command should be low in complexity, accurate in performance, issue commands within the vehicle's dynamic capability.

The existing literature on path following guidance problem can be broadly categorized as virtual target-based approaches, control theory-based solutions, and vector field-based methods. The virtual target-based framework utilizes classical missile guidance laws like a pure pursuit [1] , line-of-sight guidance [2] , proportional navigation and its variants [3] , [4] . The guidance law directs a UAV to follow a virtual target moving at a fixed look-ahead distance on the desired path which eventually drives the UAV to the path. One of the concerns with this class of solutions is the lack of virtual target existence guarantee in case there are significant disturbances that increase the UAV relative separation beyond the prescribed look-ahead distance.

Several types of control design techniques have been developed for path-following problems in robotics that include various class of UAVs. Ref. [5] , presents a survey of path following algorithms including methods like linear quadratic regulator (LQR), sliding mode control, model predictive control, back-stepping control, and adaptive control. An adaptive optimal UAV guidance law using linear quadratic regulator (LQR) formulation is presented for tighter control on errors in the presence of high wind disturbances in [6] . Ref. [7] uses the optimal guidance for achieving terminal impact angle against a target for developing path following guidance logic. In [8] , sliding mode control design is used to follow commanded course angle, thereby leading the UAV to the desired straight line or circular path. Ref. [9] proposes model predictive control to compute commanded heading direction for tracking of boundaries. Back-stepping controller design is used for underactuated follower-UAV equipped with pan-tilt camera to achieve the objective of following leader-UAV autonomously in [10] .

Vector fields present a novel path following approach which fuses both the path planning and path tracking elements into one. By providing a commanded heading direction at each point in the workspace, vector fields provide guidance inputs that are robust to disturbances, obstacle avoiding deviations and other realistic perturbations. Vector field based commanded course angle guidance for straight line and circular orbit is discussed in Ref. [8] , [11] , [12] . Nelson et al. [8] , [11] introduced vector fields approach wherein the tangent of the commanded course angle at a location was proportional to the positional error with respect to the desired path. Ref. [12] , considers the lateral-error rate as a function of ground speed and relative course orientation error which is reduced to zero subsequently using the method presented in [8] . Stable course angle variation is not inherently guaranteed for these vector fields and Lyapunov's direct approach was used to prove the same.

Lyapunov vector field utilizes the property of positive definite potential function to construct a stable vector field. The basic construction consists of a contraction term that governs the radial speed and a circulation term which controls the tangential speed with respect to the reference point or path. This approach is realized extensively in coordinated standoff target tracking scenario for stationary [13] , and maneuvering [14] – [15] [16] target. Lim et al. [15] , presented a numerical integration method for calculating individual UAV paths to achieve simultaneous stand-off tracking of target at desired position and time, whereas, [16] proposed a modified Lyapunov vector field that provides lower maximum curvature limit while circumnavigating around a stationary target.

In most of the path following methods, the focus is on deducing smooth convergence to the path and curvature variation along the trajectory has not received significant attention. Curvature relates directly to the turning rate capability of the UAV and is hence an important consideration in UAV path following guidance algorithm design. In this work, a new vector field based guidance method is proposed for UAVs to follow desired straight line and circular paths. More versatile form of commanded course angle is proposed while considering curvature analysis to establish the significance of the proposed vector field method. As the main contributions of this work, a significant curvature advantage is established for the proposed method.
SECTION II.
Proposed Guidance Law

This section discusses the proposed guidance method for the path following problem. Considering straight line and circular orbit as two desired path following scenario commanded course angle is proposed in terms of the UAV position error with respect to the path. The nonlinear kinematics of UAV for a two-dimensional engagement scenario can be expressed as
x ˙ y ˙ = V cos χ = V sin χ (1) (2)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{align*} \dot{x} & =V\cos\chi \tag{1}\\ \dot{y} & =V\sin\chi \tag{2} \end{align*} where, ( x , y ) is the instantaneous position of UAV in cartesian coordinates. Here, χ , as mentioned above is the course angle measured with respect to the positive x -axis.

A. Straight Line Path Following

The proposed vector field guidance law considers a straight line path following scenario as shown in Fig. 1 , wherein, UAV is at a distance x from the path to be followed, the desired course angle χ d can be expressed as,
χ d = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ sin − 1 ( 1 1 + k l x 2 ) , π − sin − 1 ( 1 1 + k l x 2 ) , if   x ≤ 0 otherwise (3)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \chi_{d}=\begin{cases} \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1+k_{l}x^{2}}\right), & \text{if}\ x\leq 0\\ \pi-\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1+k_{l}x^{2}}\right), & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \tag{3} \end{equation*} where k l is a positive constant given for straight line path following. Fig. 2 shows the proposed heading angle profile with respect to lateral error considering k l = 0.005 . It can be seen that the proposed course angle varies smoothly to the desired course angle on the path, that is, χ = π 3 at x = 0 . At very large distances from the path, the commanded heading is pointed along the shortest distance approach to the path, that is, χ = 0 or π . The specific choice of course angle variation is motivated by the resulting curvature characteristics, more details of which will be discussed in Section III . The commanded heading variation with different choices of k l is plotted in Fig. 3 . It is evident from Fig. 3 that higher values of k l correspond to steeper variation in course angle near the desired path.

The asymptotic behavior of proposed straight line path following guidance law can be verified using Lyapunov's indirect method. Consider a candidate Lyapunov function W = 1 2 x 2 , which on differentiating with respect to time results in
W ˙ = x x ˙ (4)

On rearranging Eqn. (5) ,

B. Circular Path Following

Consider a circular path following scenario shown in Fig. 4 , where UAV is placed outside a desired circular orbit, and instantaneous pose is represented in terms of polar coordinates ( r , γ ). In this case, the commanded course angle χ d is proposed in terms of radial distance r , measured from center ( x c , y c ) of the desired circular orbit of radius r d as
χ d = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ γ + sin − 1 ( 1 1 + k c ( r − r d ) 2 ) , γ + π − sin − 1 ( 1 1 + k c ( r − r d ) 2 ) , if   0 < r ≤ r d r ≥ r d (9)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \chi_{d}=\begin{cases} \gamma+\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1+k_{c}(r-r_{d})^{2}}\right), & \text{if}\ 0 < r\leq r_{d}\\ \gamma+\pi-\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1+k_{c}(r-r_{d})^{2}}\right), & r\geq r_{d} \end{cases} \tag{9} \end{equation*} where, k c is a positive constant for circular path following scenario. The first term in Eq. (9) corresponds to a commanded course angle variation with χ d = γ + π 2 at r = r d . For second term in Eq. (9) , the proposed course angle is directed towards the center of circular orbit for r > > r d with χ d ≈ γ + π and it attains χ d = γ + π 2 at r = r d . The equations of motion of UAV can be expressed in polar coordinates as
r ˙ γ ˙ = V cos ( χ − γ ) = V r sin ( χ − γ ) (10) (11)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{align*} \dot{r} & =V\cos(\chi-\gamma) \tag{10}\\ \dot{\gamma} & =\frac{V}{r}\sin(\chi-\gamma) \tag{11} \end{align*}

Similar to the analysis presented in Section A, we consider a Lyapunov function as W = 1 2 r ~ 2 , where radial distance error is expressed as r ~ = r − r d . Upon differentiation of the function,
W ˙ = r ~ r ~ ˙ (12)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \dot{W}=\tilde{r}\dot{\tilde{r}} \tag{12} \end{equation*}

Using Eq. (10) , in Eq. (12) results in
W ˙ = r ~ V cos ( χ d − γ ) (13)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \dot{W}=\tilde{r}V\cos(\chi_{d}-\gamma) \tag{13} \end{equation*}

Using Eq. (9) in Eq. (13) and on further simplification
W ˙ = − | r ~ | V cos ( sin − 1 ( 1 1 + k c ( r − r d ) 2 ) ) ⇒ W ˙ < 0   for all     r ≠ r d and ,   W ˙ = 0   for   r = r d (14) (15) (16)

Hence, the system is asymptotically stable about r = r d .
SECTION III.
Curvature Characteristics

Curvature variation for the proposed vector field can be obtained as
κ = d χ d d s = d χ d d t d s d t = χ ˙ d V (17)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \kappa =\frac{d\chi_{d}}{ds}=\frac{\frac{d\chi_{d}}{dt}}{\frac{ds}{dt}}=\frac{\dot{\chi}_{d}}{V} \tag{17} \end{equation*}

From Eq. (17) , it is clear that curvature is directly proportional to turn rate of UAV.
A. Straight Line Path

Using Eq. (3) and considering x > 0 , the course rate can be obtained as
χ ˙ d = 2 k l x ( 1 + k l x 2 ) k 2 l x 4 + 2 k l x 2 − − − − − − − − − − √ x ˙ (18)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \dot{\chi}_{d}=\frac{2k_{l}x}{(1+k_{l}x^{2})\sqrt{k_{l}^{2}x^{4}+2k_{l}x^{2}}}\dot{x} \tag{18} \end{equation*}

Using Eq. (1) and Eq. (3) , in Eq. (18)
χ ˙ d = 2 k l x ( 1 + k l x 2 ) k 2 l x 4 + 2 k l x 2 − − − − − − − − − − √ V cos χ d (19)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \dot{\chi}_{d}=\frac{2k_{l}x}{(1+k_{l}x^{2})\sqrt{k_{l}^{2}x^{4}+2k_{l}x^{2}}}V\cos\chi_{d} \tag{19} \end{equation*}

On further simplifying and rearranging Eq. (19)
χ ˙ d = − 2 V k l x ( 1 + k l x 2 ) 2 (20)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \dot{\chi}_{d}=-\frac{2Vk_{l}x}{(1+k_{l}x^{2})^{2}} \tag{20} \end{equation*}

Finally, using Eq. (17) , an expression for the curvature can be deduced as
κ = − 2 k l x ( 1 + k l x 2 ) 2 (21)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \kappa=-\frac{2k_{l} x}{(1+k_{l}x^{2})^{2}} \tag{21} \end{equation*}

The curvature maxima can be obtained on solving d κ d x = 0 . Accordingly,
d d x { − 2 k l x ( 1 + k l x 2 ) 2 } = 0 , ⇒ x = 1 3 k l − − − √ (22)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \frac{d}{dx}\left\{\frac{-2k_{l}x}{(1+k_{l}x^{2})^{2}}\right\}=0,\quad \Rightarrow x\quad =\quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{3k_{l}}} \tag{22} \end{equation*}

Using Eq. (22) in Eq. (21) , the maximum curvature can be obtained as κ m a x = − 9 8 k l 3 − − √ , which occurs at x = 1 3 k l √ .
B. Circular Path

Similar to the case of straight lines, the expression of curvature for the circular path can be obtained by using Eq. (17) as
κ = 1 r ( 1 + k c ( r − r d ) 2 ) − 2 k c ( r − r d ) ( 1 + k c ( r − r d ) 2 ) 2   for all   r ≥ r d (23)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \kappa=\frac{1}{r(1+k_{c}(r-r_{d})^{2})}-\frac{2k_{c}(r-r_{d})}{(1+k_{c}(r-r_{d})^{2})^{2}}\ \text{for all} \ r\geq r_{d}\tag {23} \end{equation*}

On differentiating Eq. (23) , w.r.t r , a higher-order nonlinear equation is obtained, which does not lead to feasible explicit closed-form expression of maximum curvature.
SECTION IV.
Simulation and Results

This section considers a two-dimensional kinematic model for simulation studies with first order course control. The first order course control considered for simulation results can be expressed as
χ ˙ = α ( χ d − χ ) (24)
View Source Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features. \begin{equation*} \dot{\chi}=\alpha(\chi_{d}-\chi) \tag{24} \end{equation*} where, α is a proportional gain constant. Considering straight line and circular path following scenario, UAV trajectory and corresponding parameters establishing successful convergence across the desired trajectory are plotted in subsequent sections.

A. Straight Line Path Following

Consider an initial position of UAV at ( x 0 , y 0 ) = ( 90 m , − 90 m ) with a constant speed of V = 25   m / s is assigned to follow the desired path at x = 0   m . The proposed vector field is generated using gain k l = 0. 0015 which corresponds to a commanded course direction (using Eqn. (3) ) of 176.4 degree at initial lateral error(initial x -cordinates) x 0 = 90   m . Fig. 5a plots UAV trajectory to follow desired straight line path at x = 0   m . Fig. 5b shows course angle converges to 90 degree at zero lateral error, thereby leading to the desired path. Fig. 5c illustrates the convergence of lateral error to zero.

Fig. 5d demonstrate the comparative curvature performance with Nelson et al. for straight line path following scenario. The curvature maxima expression for considered commanded course angle of 176.4 degree and given initial lateral error results in κ m a x = − 2.59 x 0 for the proposed method, whereas, for Nelson et al., corresponding expression is κ m a x = − 6.12 x 0 . The curvature maxima so obtained for initial lateral error of 90 m, results in κ m a x = − 0.028   m − 1 at x = 13.45   m for the proposed method, which matches the theoretical value as discussed in Section III . Maximum curvature for Ref. [8] , is κ m a x = − 0.068   m − 1 at x = 4.00   m . The comparative results show the significant advantage of the method offers in terms of the maximum curvature of the path.
B. Circular Path Following

Consider a desired circular orbit of center ( x c , y c ) = (0m, 0m) and radius r d = 50 m is used for simulation studies. Here, speed of UAV is kept constant at 25 m/s and gain k c is calculated for each case.
1) Initial Point Outside a Circular Orbit

For initial point outside the orbit, UAV is considered to be at ( r 0 , γ 0 ) = ( 100 m , 5 ∘ ) with initial course angle χ 0 = 150 ∘ and the gain constant k c used for simulation is 0.006. Fig. 6a shows UAV trajectory for path following of circular orbit. Fig. 6b illustrates radial error converges to zero in approximately 4 seconds. The corresponding radial distance converges to the desired radius of r d = 50   m as shown in Fig. 6c .

Fig. 6d illustrate the comparative curvature performance with Nelson et al. [8] . The curvature maxima for the proposed method results in κ m a x   =   − 0.038   m − 1 at r   =   58.36   m , whereas, that for Ref. [8] , maximum curvature is κ m a x = − 0.107   m − 1 at r = 52.31   m .

2) Initial Point Inside a Circular Orbit

UAV is considered to be inside a circular orbit at ( r 0 , γ 0 ) = ( 10 m , 5 ∘ ) with initial course angle χ 0 = 30 ∘ , while considering the desired orbit radius to be the same as in Case 1. The gain constant k c is considered to be 0.009 for this case. Fig. 7a represents the trajectory of UAV. Fig. 7b illustrates that the radial error converges to zero in approximately 3 seconds. Fig. 7c illustrates successful convergence to a desired circular orbit.

Fig. 7d demonstrate the comparative curvature performance with Ref. [8] . The maximum curvature for the proposed method resulted in κ m a x   =   0.08   m − 1 , which occurs at position r = 44.69   m , whereas, for the method proposed in Ref. [8] , maximum curvature found to be κ m a x = 0.17   m − 1 , at r = 48.26   m .

SECTION V.
Conclusions

A new vector field is proposed for straight line and circular path following. The proposed vector field generates a commanded heading direction as an arc-sin variation of a nonlinear function of the position error throughout the domain of interest. Curvature analysis is carried out to obtain a closed-form expression of the maximum curvature for the straight line path following scenario. Simulation results show a significant advantage for the proposed method in terms of the maximum curvature as compared to a popular existing method. Addressing variable curvature and validation with high fidelity vehicle model are some future directions.
