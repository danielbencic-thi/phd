PREFACE FOR THE SECOND EDITION
I have been very pleased with the success of my book. When it was apparent that the second printing was nearly sold out, Springer-Verlag asked me to prepare a list of corrections for a third printing. When I
mentioned that r had some ideas for more substantial revisions, they
reacted with characteristic enthusiasm. There are four major differences between the present edition and its
predecessor. First, John Dixon's treatment of Cauchy's Theorem has been included. This has the advantage of providing a quick proof of the theorem in its full generality. Nevertheless, I have a strong attachment to the homotopic version that appeared in the first edition and have proved this form of Cauchy's Theorem as it was done there. This version is very geometric and quite easy to apply. Moreover, the notion of homotopy is needed for the later treatment of the monodromy theorem; hence, inclusion of this version yields benefits far in excess of the time needed to discuss it.
Second. the proof of Runge's Theorem is new. The present proof is due to Sandy Grabiner and does not use "pole pushing". In a sense the "pole pushing" is buried in the concept of uniform approximation and some ideas from Banach algebras. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that the proof is entirely elementary in that it relies only on the material presented in this text.
Next, an Appendix B has been added. This appendix contains some bibliographical material and a guide for further reading.
Finally, several additional exercises have been added. There are also minor changes that have been made. Several colleagues in the mathematical community have helped me greatly by providing constructive criticism and pointing out typographical errors. I wish to thank publicly Earl Berkson, Louis Brickman, James Deddens, Gerard Keough, G. K. Kristiansen, Andrew Lenard, John Mairhuber, Donald C. Meyers, Jeffrey Nunemacher, Robert Olin, Donald Perlis, John Plaster, Hans Sagan, Glenn Schober, David Stegenga, Richard Varga, James P. Williams, and Max Zorn. Finally, I wish to thank the staff at Springer-Verlag New York not only for their treatment of my book, but also for the publication of so many fine books on mathematics. In the present time of shrinking graduate enrollments and the consequent reluctance of so many publishers to print advanced texts and monographs, Springer-Verlag is making a contribution to our discipline by increasing its efforts to disseminate the recent developments in mathematics.

PREFACE
This book is intended as a textbook for a first course in the theory of functions of one complex variable for students who are mathematically mature enough to understand and execute E - 8 arguments. The actual prerequisites for reading this book are quite minimal; not much more than a stiff course in basic calculus and a few facts about partial derivatives. The topics from advanced calculus that are used (e.g., Leibniz's rule for differentiating under the integral sign) are proved in detail.
Complex Variables is a subject which has something for all mathematicians. In addition to having applications to other parts of analysis, it can rightly claim to be an ancestor of many areas of mathematics (e.g., homotopy theory, manifolds). This view of Complex Analysis as "An Introduction to Mathematics" has influenced the writing and selection of subject matter for this book. The other guiding principle followed is that all definitions, theorems, etc. should be clearly and precisely stated. Proofs are given with the student in mind. Most are presented in detail and when this is not the case the reader is told precisely what is missing and asked to fill in the gap as an exercise. The exercises are varied in their degree of difficulty. Some are meant to fix the ideas of the section in the reader's mind and some extend the theory or give applications to other parts of mathematics. (Occasionally, terminology is used in an exercise which is not defined-e.g., group, integral domain.)
Chapters I through V and Sections VI.l and VI.2 are basic. It is possible to cover this material in a single semester only if a number of proofs are omitted. Except for the material at the beginning of Section VI.3 on convex functions, the rest of the book is independent of VI. 3 and VI.4.
Chapter VII initiates the student in the consideration of functions as points in a metric space. The results of the first three sections of this chapter are used repeatedly in the remainder of the book. Sections four and five need no defense; moreover, the Weierstrass Factorization Theorem is necessary for Chapter XI. Section six is an application of the factorization theorem. The last two sections of Chapter VII are not needed in the rest of the book although they are a part of classical mathematics which no one should completely disregard.
The remaining chapters are independent topics and may be covered in any order desired.
Runge's Theorem is the inspiration for much of the theory of Function Algebras. The proof presented in section VIII. I is, however, the classical one involving "pole pushing". Section two applies Runge's Theorem to obtain a more general form of Cauchy's Theorem. The main results of sections three and four should be read by everyone, even if the proofs are not.
Chapter IX studies analytic continuation and introduces the reader to analytic manifolds and covering spaces. Sections one through three can be considered as a unit and will give the reader a knowledge of analytic

continuation without necessitating his going through all of Chapter IX.

Chapter X studies harmonic functions including a solution of the Dirichlet Problem and the introduction of Green's Function. If this can be called applied mathematics it is part of applied mathematics that everyone should know.

Although they are independent, the last two chapters could have been

combined into one entitled "Entire Functions". However, it is felt that

Hadamard's Factorization Theorem and the Great Theorem of Picard are

sufficiently different that each merits its own chapter. Also, neither result depends upon the other.

With regard to Picard's Theorem it should be mentioned that another

proof is available. The proof presented here uses only elementary arguments

while the proof found in most other books uses the modular function.

There are other topics that could have been covered. Some consideration

was given to including chapters on some or all of the following: conformal

mapping, functions on the disk, elliptic functions, applications of Hilbert

space methods to complex functions. But the line had to be drawn somewhere

and these topics were the victims. For those readers who would like to explore

this material or to further investigate the topics covered in this book, the bibliography contains a number of appropriate entries.

Most of the notation used is standard. The word "iff" is used in place of

the phrase "if and only if", and the symbol. is used to indicate the end of a

proof. When a function (other than a path) is being discussed, Latin letters

are used for the domain and Greek letters are used for the range.

This book evolved from classes taught at Indiana University. I would like

to thank the Department of Mathematics for making its resources available

to me during its preparation. I would especially like to thank the students

in my classes; it was actually their reaction to my course in Complex Variables

that made me decide to take the plunge and write a book. Particular thanks sho~ld go to Marsha Meredith for pointing out several mistakes in an early

draft, to Stephen Berman for gathering the material for several exercises on

algebra, and to Larry Curnutt for assisting me with the final corrections of the

manuscript. I must also thank Ceil Sheehan for typing the final draft of the

manuscript under unusual circumstances. Finally, I must thank my wife to whom this book is dedicated. Her

encouragement was the most valuable assistance I received.

Chapter 1
The Complex Number System
§1. The real numbers
We denote the set of all real numbers by IR. It is assumed that each reader is acquainted with the real number system and all its properties. In particular we assume a knowledge of the ordering of IR, the definitions and properties of the supremum and infimum (sup and inf), and the completeness of IR (every non-empty set in IR which is bounded above has a supremum). It is also assumed that every reader is familiar with sequential convergence in IR and with infinite series. Finally, no one should undertake a study of Complex Variables unless he has a thorough grounding in functions of one real variable. Although it has been traditional to study functions of several real variables before studying analytic function theory, this is not an essential prerequisite for this book. There will not be any occasion when the deep results of this an:a are needed.
§2. The field of complex numbers
We define C, the complex numbers, to be the set of an ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are real numbers and where addition and multiplication are defined by:
(a, b)+(c, d) = (a+c, b+d)
(a, b) (c, d) = (ac-bd, bc+ad)
It is easily checked that with these definitions C satisfies all the axioms for a field. That is, C satisfies the associative, commutative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication; (0,0) and (1,0) are identities for addition and multiplication respectively, and there are additive and multiplicative inverses for each nonzero element in C.
We will write a for the complex number (a, 0). This mapping a --* (a, 0) defines a field isomorphism of IR into C so we may consider IR as a subset of
C. If we put i = (0, 1) then (a, b) = a+bi. From this point on we abandon
the ordered pair notation for complex numbers.
Note that i2 = - 1, so that the equation Z2 + 1 = 0 has a root in IC. In
fact, for each z in C, Z2+ I = (z+i) (z-i). More generally, if z and ware
complex numbers we obtain
Z2+ W2 = (z+iw) (z-iw)

The Complex Number System

By letting z and w be real numbers a and b we can obtain (with both a and

b "# 0)

a~ib = a~~~2 = a2:b2 - {a2!b2)

so that we have a formula for the reciprocal of a complex number.
When we write z = a + ib (a, b E IR) we call a and b the real and imaginary parts of z and denote this by a = Re z, b = Im z.
We conclude this section by introducing two operations on IC which are
not field operations. If z = x + iy(x, y E IR) then we define Izl = (x2+y2)!- to
be the absolute value of z and z = x - iy is the conjugate of z. Note that

2.1

In particular, if z "# 0 then

Z Izl2

The following are basic properties of absolute values and conjugates whose verifications are left to the reader.

2.2

Rez = !(z+z) and Imz = 21i (z-z).

2.3

(z+w) = z+w and zw = zw.

2.4

Izwl = Izllwl·

2.5

Izjwl = Izlllwl·

2.6

Izl = Izl·

The reader should try to avoid expanding z and w into their real and imaginary parts when he tries to prove these last three. Rather, use (2.1), (2.2), and (2.3).

Exercises

1. Find the real and imaginary parts of each of the following:

!. z-~(aEIR)' z3. 3+5i. (-I+iJ3)3;

z ' z+a

2. Find the absolute value and conjugate of each of the following: 3-i i

3. Show that z is a real number if and only if Z = Z.

4. If z and ware complex numbers, prove the following equations:

Iz+wl2 = Iz1 2 +2Re zw+ Iwlz.

IZ-WJ2 = Iz1 2 -2Re zw+ Jwi 2•

Iz+ wlz + Iz- wlz = 2(lz12 + IwI Z).

5. Use induction to prove that for z = ZI + .. . +zn; W = WIW2 ••• Wn:
Iwl = IWII·· ·Iwnl; 2 = 21 +., .+2n; W = WI ... wn'
6. Let R(z) be a rational function of z. Show that R(z) = R(i) if all the
coefficients in R(z) are real.

§3. The complex plane

From the definition of complex numbers it is dear that each z in C can be identified with the unique point (Re z, 1m z) in the plane [R2. The addition
°( of complex numbers is exactly the addition law of the vector space [R2.
If z and ware in C then draw the straight lines from z and w to = (0, 0». These form two sides of a parallelogram with 0, z and w as three vertices.
The fourth vertex turns out to be z +w.
Note also that Iz-wl is exactly the distance between z and w. With this in mind the last equation of Exercise 4 in the preceding section states the parallelogram law: The sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a parallelogram equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of its diagonals.
A fundamental property of a distance function is that it satisfies the triangle inequality (see the next chapter). In this case this inequality becomes

IZ1- z21 s IZI- Z31 + IZ3-z21

for complex numbers ZI, Z2, Z3' By using ZI-Z2 = (ZI-Z3)+(Z3-Z2), it is easy to see that we need only show

3.1

Iz+wl s Izl + Iwl (z, WE q.

To show this first observe that for any z in C,

3.2

-IZI s Rez s Izl

-izi s Imz s Izi Hence, Re (zw) s izwi = Jzllwl. Thus,

Iz+wl2 = Iz1 2 +2Re (zw) + Iwl 2

s IzI2+2Izllwl+lwI2 = (izi + Iwl)2,

from which (3.1) follows. (This is called the triangle inequality because, if we
represent z and w in the plane, (3.1) says that the length of one side of the
triangle [0, z, z -+ w] is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.
Or, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.) On encounter-

4

The Complex Number System

ing an inequality one should always ask for necessary and sufficient conditions

that equality obtains. From looking at a triangle and considering the geo-
metrical significal'lce of (3.1) we are led to consider the condition z = tw
for some t E IR, t ;:: O. (or IV = tz if IV = 0). It is clear that equality will occur when the two points are colinear with the origin. In fact, if we look

at the proof of (3.1) we see that a necessary and sufficient condition for
Iz + wi = Izi + Iw, is that Izwl = Re (zw). Equivalently, this is zw ;:: 0 (i.e., zw
is a real number and is non negative). MultiplyinK this by w/w we get
IwI 2(z/w);:: Oifw # O. If

t

=

z./w

=

(

''wi

2 (z/w)

then t ;:: 0 and z = two By induction we also get

3.3

Also useful is the inequality

3.4

Izl-Iwll s:; Iz-wl

Now that we have given a geometric interpretation of the absolute value let us see what taking a complex conjugate does to a point in the plane. This is also easy; in fact, Z is the point obtained by reflecting z across the x-axis (i.e., the real axis).

Exercises
1. Prove (3.4) and give necessary and sufficient conditions for equality.
2. Show that equality occurs in (3.3) if and only if zdz/ ;:: 0 for any integers k and I, 1 s:; k, I s:; n, for which Zl # O. 3. Let a E rr~ and c > 0 be fixed. Describe the set of points z satisfying
Iz-al-Iz+al = 2c
for every possible choice of a and c. Now let a be any complex number and, using a rotation of the plane, describe the locus of points satisfying the above equation.

§4. Polar representation and roots of complex numbers

Consider the point z = x + iy in the complex plane C. This point has polar coordinates Cr, 8): x = r cos 8, y = r sin e. Clearly r = Izi and () is
the angle between the positive real axis and the line segment from 0 to Z.
Notice that 8 plus any multiple of 211" can be substituted for 8 in the above
equations. The angle () is called the argument ofz and is denoted by e = arg z. Because of the ambiguity of e, "arg" is not a function. We introduce the
notation

4.1

cis 8 = cos 8+i sin 8.

Polar representation and roots of complex numbers

5

Let ZI = 1'1 cis 81, Z2 = 1'2 cis 82 , Then Z1Z2 = 1'11'2 cis 01 cis O2 = 1'11'2
[(cos 01 cos Oz-sin Ol sin (2)+i (sin 01 cos 02+sin 82 cos OJ)]. By the formulas for the sine and cosine of the sum of two angles we get

4.2
Alternately, arg(ZtZ2) = arg ZI + arg Z1' (What function of a real variable
takes products into sums?) By induction we get for Z k = rk cis (j h' 1 ~ k ~ 11,

4.3

In particular,

4.4

Z" = I'" cis (ne),

for every integer n ;::: O. Moreover if z #- 0, z· [r - 1 cis (- 0)] = 1; so that (4.4) also holds for all integers n, positive, negative, and zero, if z #- O. As a special case of (4.4) we get de M oivre's formula:

(cos O+i sin 8t = cos n8+i sin nO.

We are now in a position to consider the following problem: For a given
complex number a#-O and an integer n ;::: 2, can you find a number z
satisfying zn = a? How many such z can you find? In light of (4.4) the
solution is easy. Let a = lal cis ex; by (4.4), Z = lal '/II cis (aln) fills the bill.

§5. Lines and halfplanes in the complex plane

Let L denote a straight line in C. From elementary analytic geometry, L is determined by a point in L and a direction vector. Thus if a is any point in Land b is its direction vector then
L = {z = a+tb: - 00 < t < oo}.
Since b =1= 0 this gives, for z in L,
1m ( zb-a) = O.

In fact if z is such that

O=lm ( zb-a)

then 1= ( z---a)

What is the locus of each of the sets
{z: Im(z~a) > o},

{z: 1m (z~a) < o} ?

As a first step in answering this question, observe that since b is a direction
we may assume Ibl = 1. For the moment, let us consider the case where
a = 0, and put Ho = {z: 1m (z/b) > O}, b = cis f3. If z = r cis () then z/b = r cis «()-f3). Thus, z is in Ho if and only if sin «()-f3) > 0; that is, when
f3 < 8 < 7T+f3. Hence Ho is the half plane lying to the left of the line L if

we are "walking along L in the direction of b." If we put
then it is easy to see that Ha = a+Ho == {a+w: WE Ho}; that is, Ha is the
translation of Ho by a. Hence, Ha is the half plane lying to the left of L. Similarly,

§6. The extended plane and its spherical representation
Often in complex analysis we will be concerned with functions that become infinite as the variable approaches a given point. To discuss this situa-
tion we introduce the extended plane which is IC U {oo} == 1C00. We also
wish to introduce a distance function on 1C00 in order to discuss continuity properties of functions assuming the value infinity. To accomplish this and to give a concrete picture of 1C00 we represent 1C00 as the unit sphere in 1R3,
s= {(XI,X2,X3)EIR3:xf+x~+x~ = I}.
Let N = (0,0, 1); that is, N is the north pole on S. Also, identify IC with {(Xl' X2' 0): Xl' X2 E IR} so that IC cuts S along the equator. Now for each point z in IC consider the straight line in 1R3 through z and N. This intersects
.'v

the sphere in exactly one point Z #- N. If /z/ > 1 then Z is in the northern hemisphere and if /z/ < I then Z is in the southern hemisphere; also, for
/z/ = I, Z = z. What happens to Z as /z/ -+ oo? Clearly Z approaches N;
hence, we identify N and the point 00 in 1C00. Thus 1C00 is represented as the sphere S.
Let us explore this representation. Put z = X+ iy and let Z = (Xl' X2' X3) be the corresponding point on S. We will find equations expressing Xl' x 2, and X3 in terms of X and y. The line in 1R3 through z and N is given by {tN+(I-t)z: -00 < t < oo}, or by

6.1

{«I-t)x,(I-t)y,t): -00 < t < oo}.

Hence, we can find the coordinates of Z if we can find the value of t a't

which this line intersects S. If 1 is this value then

1 = (l_t)2x2+(1_t)2y2+t2

= (l_t)2IzI2+t2

From which we get

Now let us define a distance function between points in the extended plane in the following manner: for z, z' in Coo define the distance from z to z', d(z, z'), to be the distance between the corresponding points Z and Z' in 1R3.
If Z = (Xl' X2' X3) and Z' = (x;, X2' Xl) then

6.5

Using the fact that Z and Z' are on S, (6.5) gives

Chapter II Metric Spaces and the Topology of C

§1. Definition and examples of metric spaces

A metric space is a pair (X, d) where X is a set and d IS a function from X x X into IR, called a distance function or metric, which satisfies the following conditions for x, y, and z in X:
d(x,y) ~ 0
d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y d(x, y) = dey, x) (symmetry)
d(x, z) ::::; d(x, y)+d(y, z) (triangle inequality)
If x and r > 0 are fixed then define B(x;r) = {yeX: d(x,y) < r}
H(x;r) = {yeX: d(x,y)::::; r}. B(x; r) and H(x; r) are called the open and closed balls, respectively, with center x and radius r.

Examples

1.1 Let X = IR or C and define d(z, w) = Jz-wJ. This makes both (IR, d)

and (C, d) metric spaces. In fact, (C, d) will be the example of principal

interest to us. If the reader has never encountered the concept of a metric

space before this, he should continually keep (C, d) in mind during the study

of this chapter.

1.2 Let (X, d) be a metric space and let Y eX; then (Y, d) is also a metric

space.

1.3 Let X = C and define d(x+iy, a+ib) = Jx-aJ+Jy-bJ. Then (C, d) is

a metric space.

1.4 Let X = C and define d(x+iy, a+ib) = max {Jx-aJ, Jy-bJ}.

1.5 Let X be any set and define d(x, y) = 0 if x = y and d(x, y) = I if x of. y.

To show that the function d satisfies the triangle inequality one merely

considers all possibilities of equality among x, y, and z. Notice here that

B(x; E) consists only of the point x if E ::::; 1 and B(x; E) = X if E > 1. This

metric space does not appear in the study of analytic function theory.

1.6 Let X = IRn and for x = (Xl> ••• , xn), y = (Yl' ... ,Yn) in IRn define

Metric Spaces and the Topology of C

1.7 Let S be any set and denote by B(S) the set of all functions f: S ~ C such that

IlflL" == sup {If(s)l: s E S} < 00.

That is, B(S) consists of all complex valued functions whose range is con-
tained inside some disk of finite radius. For f and g in B(S) define d(f; g) =
Ilf-g;lw' We will show that d satisfies the triangle inequality. In fact if J,
g, and h are in B(S) and s is any point in S then If(s)-g(s)1 = If(s)-h(s)+
h(s)-g(s)1 ::; If(s)-h(s)1 + Ih(s)-g(s)[ ::; Ilf-hil oo + Ilh-giloo" Thus, when the
supremum is taken over all s in S, Ilf-gilro ::; IIf-h 1100 +IIh-gll oo , which is
the triangle inequality for d.

1.8 Definition. For a metric space (X, d) a set G c X is open if for each x in G there is an E > 0 such that B(x; E) c G.
Thus, a set in C is open if it has no "edge." For example, G = {z E C: a < Re z < b} is open; but {z: Re z < O} u {O} is not because B(O; E) is not contained in this set no matter how small we choose E.
We denote the empty set, the set consisting of no elements, by D.

1.9 Proposition. Let (X, d) be a metric space; then:

n (a) The sets X and D are open;

n

(b) If G1, ..• , Gn are open sets in X then so is Gk ;

k~l

(c) If {G/ j E J} is a collection of open sets in X, J any indexing set,

then G = U {G j : j E J} is also open.
n n
Proof The proof of (a) is a triviality. To prove (b) let x E G = Gk ; then
k~1
x E Gk for k = 1, ... , n. Thus, by the definition, for each k there is an Ek > 0 such that B(x; Ek) C Gk • But if E = min {El' E2, ••• , En} then for 1 ::; k ::; n

B(x; E) c B(x; Ek) C Gk• Thus B(x; E) c G and G is open.

The proof of (c) is left as an exercise for the reader. •

There is another class of subsets of a metric space which are distinguished.

These are the sets which contain all their "edge"; alternately, the sets whose

complements have no "edge."

1.10 Definition. A set F c X is closed if its complement, X - F, is open. The following proposition is the complement of Proposition 1.9. The
proof, whose execution is left to the reader, is accomplished by applying de Morgan's laws to the preceding proposition.

1.11 Proposition. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then:

(a) The sets X and D are closed;

n

U (b) If F1, ••• , Fn are closed sets in X then so is Fk ;

k~l

(c) If {Fj : j E J} is any collection of closed sets in X, J any indexing set,

then F = n {Fj : j E J} is also closed.

The most common error made upon learning of open and closed sets

is to interpret the definition of closed set to mean that if a set is not open it is

Definition and examples of metric spaces

13

closed. This, of course, is false as can be seen by looking at {z E C: Re z > O} u {O}; it is neither open nor closed.

U n 1.12 Definition. Let A be a subset of X. Then the interior of A, int A, is the
set {G: G is open and G c A}. The closure of A, A-, is the set {F: F
is closed and F :::> A}. Notice that int A may be empty and A - may be X.
If A = {a+bi: a and b are rational numbers} then simultaneously A- = C
and int A = O. By Propositions 1.9 and 1.11 we have that A - is closed and
int A is open. The boundary of A is denoted by OA and defined by OA = A-
n (X-A)-.

1.13 Proposition. Let A and B be subsets of a metric space (X, d). Then:
(a) A is open if and only if A = int A; (b) A is closed if and only if A = A -;
(c) int A = X-(X-A)-; A- -= X-int (X-A); OA = A--int A;
(d) (A u B)- = A- u B-;
(e) Xo E int A if and only if there is an € > 0 such that B(xo; €) C A; (f) Xo E A - if and only if for every € > 0, B(xo; €) n A :f. O.

Proof. The proofs of (a)-(e) are left to the reader. To prove (f) assume
xoEA- = X-int (X-A); thus, xo¢int (X-A). By part (e), for every
€ > 0 B(xo; €) is not contained in X -A. That is, there is a point y E B(xo; €)
which is not in X-A. Hence, yEB(xo; €)nA. Now suppose xo¢A- =
X -int (X -A). Then Xo E int (X -A) and, by (e), there is an € > 0 such
that B(xo; €) eX-A. That is, B(xo; €) n A = 0 so that Xo does not
satisfy the condition. •
Finally, one last definition of a distinguished type of set.

1.14 Definition. A subset A of a metric space X is dense if A - = X. The set of rational numbers 0 is dense in IR and {x+iy: x, yEO} is
dense in Co

§2. Connectedness
Let us start this section by giving an example. Let X = {z € c: Izl :::; I} u {z: Iz-31 < I} and give X the metric it inherits from Co (Hencefol'ward,
whenever we consider subsets X of IR or C as metric spaces we will assume,
unless stated to the contrary, that Xhas the inherited metric d(z, w) = Iz- wi.)
Then the set A = {z: Izl :::; I} is simultaneously open and closed. It is closed because its complement in X, B = X -A = {z: Iz-31 < I} is open; A is
open because if a E A then B(a; 1) c A. (Notice that it may not happen that {z € C: Iz-al < I} is contained in A-for example, if a = 1. But the definition of B(a; 1) is {z € X: Iz-al < I} and this is contained in A.) Similarly B is also both open and closed in X.
This is an example of a non-connected space.
2.1 Definition. A metric space (X, d) is connected if the only subsets of X which are both open and closed are D and X. If A c X then A is a connected subset of X if the metric space (A, d) is connected.
An equivalent formulation of connectedness is to say that X is not connected if there are disjoint open sets A and B in X, neither of which is
empty, such that X = A u B. In fact, if this condition holds then A = X - B
is also closed.
2.2 Proposition. A set X c IR is connected iff X is an interval.
Proof Suppose X = [a, b], a and b elements of IR. Let A c X be an open
subset of X such that a € A, and A # X. We will show that A cannot also be closed-and hence, X must be connected. Since A is open and a E A there is an e > 0 such that [a, a+e) c A. Let
r = sup {e: [a, a+£) c A}
Claim. [a,a+r) c A.lnfact,ifa:::; x < a+rthen,puttingh = a+r-x > 0, the definition of supremum implies there is an e with r - h < e < rand [a, a+£) c A. But a :::; x = a+(r-h) < a+e implies x E A and the claim is established.
However, a +r If A; for if, on the contrary, a +rEA then, by the openness
of A, there is a 8 > 0 with [a+r, a+r+8) c A. But this gives [a, a+r+8) c A, contradicting the definition of r. Now if A were also closed then a+r E B
= X-A which is open. Hence we could find a 8 > 0 such that (a +r - 8, a +r] c B, contradicting the above claim.
The proof that other types of intervals are connected is similar and it will be left as an exercise.

Connectedness

15

The proof of the converse is Exercise 1. • If wand z are in C then we denote the straight line segment from z to w by
[z, w] = {tw+{l-t)z: 0 ~ t ~ I}

U n
A polygon from a to b is a set P = [Zk' wk] where Zt = a, w" = band k=1
W k = Zk+l for 1 ~ k ~ n - 1; or, P = [a, Z2'" Zn' b).

2.3 Theorem. An open set Gee is connected ifffor any two points a, b in G there is a polygon from a to b lying entirely inside G.

Proof Suppose that G satisfies this condition and let us assume that G is not connected. We will obtain a contradiction. From the definition, G =
A U B where A and B are both open and closed, A n B = D, and neither
A nor B is empty. Let a EA and bE B; by hypothesis there is a polygon P from a to b such that peG. Now a moment's thought will show that one of the segments making up P will have one end point in A and another in B. So we can assume that P = [a, b]. Define,

S = {s E [0,1]: sb+(I-s)a E A} T = {t E [0,1]: tb+{1-t)a E B}

Then S n T = D, S u T = [0, 1],0 ESand 1 ET. However it can be shown
that both Sand T are open (Exercise 2), contradicting the connectedness of [0, 1]. Thus, G must be connected.
Now suppose that G is connected and fix a point a in G. To show how to construct a polygon (lying in G!) from a to a point b in G would be difficult. But we don't have to perform such a construction; we merely show that one exists. For a fixed a in G define

A = {b EG: there is a polygon peG from a to b}.

The plan is to show that A is simultaneously open and closed in G. Since
a EA and G is connected this will give that A = G and the theorem will be
proved.
To show that A is open let bE A and let P = [a, Z2"'" zn' b] be a polygon from a to b with PeG. Since G is open (this was not needed in the first half), there is an t: > 0 such that B(b; t:) c G. But if Z E B(b; t:) then [b, z] c B(b; t:) c G. Hence the polygon Q = P U [b, z] is inside G and goes from a to z. This shows that B(b; t:) c A, and so A is open.
To show that A is closed suppose there is a point Z in G-A and let E > 0
be such that B(z; E) c G. If there is a point b in A n B(z; E) then, as above,
we can construct a polygon from a to z. Thus we must have that B(z; E) n A
= D, or B(z; E) c G-A. That is, G-A is open so that A is closed. •
2.4 Corollary. If Gee is open and connected and a and b are points in G
then there is a polygon P in G from a to b which is made up of line segments parallel to either the real or imaginary axis.
Proof There are two ways of proving this corollary. One could obtain a

16

Metric Spaces and the Topology of C

polygon in G from a to b and then modify each of its line segments so that a

new polygon is obtained with the desired properties. However, this proof is more easily executed using compactness (see Exercise 5.7). Another proof can be obtained by modifying the proof of Theorem 2.3. Define the set A as in the proof of (2.3) but add the restriction that the polygon's segments are

all parallel to one of the axes. The remainder of the proof will be valid with
one exception. If z EO B(b; €) then [b, z] may not be parallel to an axis. But it is easy to see that if z = x+iy, b = p+iq then the polygon [b, p+iy] U
[p+iy, z] c B(b; €) and has segments parallel to an axis. III
It will now be shown that any set S in a metric space can be expressed,
in a canonical way, as the union of connected pieces.

2.5 Definition. A subset D of a metric space X is a component of ,\:' if it is a maximal connected subset of X. That is, D is connected and there is no connected subset of X that properly contains D.
If the reader examines the example at the beginning of this section he will notice that both A and B are components and, furthermore, these are
the only components of X. For another example let X = {D, I, .1, t, ... }.
Then clearly every component of X is a point and each point is a component.
{M Notice that while the components are all open in X, the component {O}
is not.

2.6 Lemma. Let x 0 E X and let {D j: j E J} be a collection of connected subsets
U of X such that x 0 EO D j for each j in J. Then D = {D / j E J} is connected.

Proof Let A be a subset of the metric space CD, d) which is both open and closed and suppose that A i= O. Then A n D j is open in (D j, d) for each j and it is also closed (Exercises l.8 and 1.9). Since D j is connected we get that either A n D j = or An D j = D j • Since A i= 0 there is at least one k such that A n Dk i= 0; hence, A n Dk = Dk • In particular x 0 E A so that Xo EA n D j for every j. Thus An D j = D j , or D j C A, for each index).
This gives that D = A, so that D is connected. III

2.7 Theorem. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then: (a) Each Xo in X is contained in a component of X. (b) Distinct components of X are disjoint. Note that part (a) says that X is the union of its components.
Proof (a) Let!» be the collection of connected subsets of X which contain the given point Xo. Notice that {xo} E 9 so that!» i= O. Also notice that the hypotheses of the preceding lemma apply to the collection g. Hence
U C = {D: D EO g} is connected and Xo E C. But C must be a component.
In fact, if D is connected and C C D then x 0 EO D so that DE!»; but then DeC, so that C = D. Thus C is maximal and part (a) is proved.
(b) Suppose C 1 and Cz are components, C 1 i= C z, and suppose there is a point Xo in C 1 n Cz. Again the lemma says that C 1 U Cz is connected.

Sequences and completeness

17

Since both C 1 and C 2 are components, this gives C 1 = C 1 U C2 = Cz, a contradiction. II

2.8 Proposition. (a) IfA c X is connected and A c Be A -, then B is connected. (b) If C is a component of X then C is closed. The proof is left as an exercise.

2.9 Theorem. Let G be open in IC; then the components (!f G are open and there are only a countable number of them.

Proof. Let C be a component of G and let Xo c C. Since G is open there is an ( > 0 with B(xo; f) c G. By Lemma 2.6, B(xo; €) U C is connected and so it must be C. That is B( xo; () c C and C is, therefore. open.
To see that the number of components is countable let S = {a+ ib:
a and b are rational and a + bi E G}. Then S is countable and each com-
ponent of G contains a point of S, so that the number of components is
countable. II

connected, even if F is closed. Give an example to illustrate this.

§3. Sequences and completeness
One of the most useful concepts in a metric space is that of a convergent sequence. Their central role in calculus is duplicated in the study of metric spaces and complex analysis. 3.1 Definition. If {Xl' x 2 , ••• } is a sequence in a metric space (X, d) then

18

Metric Spaces and the Topology of C

{xn} converges to x-in symbols x = lim Xn or Xn -+ x-if for every" > 0 there is an integer N such that d(x, xn) < " whenever n ;:::: N.
Alternately, x = lim XII if 0= lim d(x, XII)'
If X = C then z = lim z" means that for each" > 0 there is an N such
that Iz-z,,1 < Eo" when n ;:::: N.

Many concepts in the theory of metric spaces can be phrased in terms

of sequences. The following is an example.

3.2 Proposition. A set F c X is closed iff for each sequence {xn} in F with
x = lim xn we have x E F.

Proof. Suppose F is closed and x = lim X Il where each X Il is in F. So for
every E > 0, there is a point x ll in B(x; E); that is B(x; £) n F", D, so that
x EO F~ = F by Proposition l.13(f).
Now suppose F is not closed; so there is a point Xo in F~ which is not in F. By Proposition 1.13(f), for every Eo" > 0 we have B(x 0; €) n F # D-
B( F. ~) In particular for every integer n there is a point XII in X 0; n Thus,

d(xo, X,I) <1 which implies that X,I -+ Xo' Since Xo tt F, this says the con-
n clition fails. •
3.3 Definition. If A c X then a point X in X is a limit point of A if there is a sequence {XII} of distinct points in A such that x = lim Xn'
The reason for the word "distinct" in this definition can be illustrated by the following example. Let X = C and let A = [0, 1] u {i}; each point in [0, IJ is a limit point of A but i is not. We do not wish to call a point such as i a limit point; but if "distinct" were dropped from the definition we could taken XII = i for each i and have i = lim x..
3.4 Proposition. (a) A set is closed iff it contains all its limit points.
(b) If A c X then A~ = A u {x: X is a limit point of A}. The proof is left as an exercise. From real analysis we know that a basic property of [f\\: is that any sequence whose terms get closer together as n gets large, must be convergent. Such sequences are called Cauchy sequences. One of their attributes is that you know the limit will exist even though you can't produce it.
° 3.5 Definition. A sequence {xn} is called a Cauchy sequence if for every
€ > there is an integer N such that d(xn' xm) < € for all n, m ;:::: N. If (X, d) has the property that each Cauchy sequence has a limit in X
then (X, d) is complete.
3.6 Proposition. C is complete.
Proof If {xn+iYn} is a Cauchy sequence in C then {xn} and {Yn} are Cauchy sequences in [f\\:. Since [f\\: is complete, Xn --+ X and Yn -+ Y for points x, Y in [f\\:.
It follows that X + iy = lim (xn +iYn), and so C is complete. III
Consider Coo with its metric d (1. 6.7 and I. 6.8). Let z'" z be points in C;

Sequences and completeness

19

it can be shown that d(zn' z) -3> 0 if and only if IZn-zl -3> O. In spite of this, any sequence {zn} with lim IZnl = 00 is Cauchy in Coo, but, of course, is not

Cauchy in C.

If A c X we define the diameter of A by diam A = sup {d(x, y): x and

yare in A}.

3.7 Cantor's Theorem. A metric space (X, d) is complete ifffor any sequence

n00
{Fn} of non-empty closed sets with F) ~ F2 ~ ... and diam Fn -3> 0, Fn

consists of a single point.

n~1

Proof Suppose (X, d) is complete and let {Fn} be a sequence of closed sets
having the properties: (i) F) ~ F2 ~ ... and (ii) lim diam Fn = O. For each
n, let Xn be an arbitrary point in Fn; if n, m ;::: N then Xn, Xm are in FN so that, by definition, d(xm xm) :<;; diam FN. By the hypothesis N can be chosen sufficiently large that diam FN < 10; this shows that {xn} is a Cauchy sequence.
Since X is complete, Xo = lim Xn exists. Also, Xn is in FN for all n ;::: N
n00
since Fn c FN; hence, Xo is in FN for every N and this gives Xo E Fn = F.
n~1
So F contains at least one point; if, also, y is in F then both Xo and yare in
Fn for each n and this gives d(xo, y) :<;; diam Fn -3> O. Therefore d(xo, y) = 0,
or Xo = y. Now let us show that X is complete if it satisfies the stated condition.
Let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence in X and put Fn = {xn' Xn+ 1, .. .}-; then
Fl ~ Fi ~ .... If 10 > 0, choose N such that d(xn, xm) < 10 for each n, m ;::: N; this gives that diam {xn' X n + 1> ••• } :<;; 10 for n ;:::: N and so diam
Fn :<;; 10 for n ;::: N (Exercise 3). Thus diam Fn -3> 0 and, by hypothesis, there
is a point Xo in X with {xo} = F) (J F2 (J •••• In particular Xo is in Fn, and so d(xo, xn) :<;; diam Fn -3> O. Therefore, Xo = lim Xn. •
There is a standard exercise associated with this theorem. It is to find a
sequence of sets {Fn} in IR which satisfies two of the conditions:
(a) each Fn is closed, (b) F) ~ F2 ~ ... ,
(c) diam Fn -3> 0;
but which has F = F) (J F2 (J ••• either empty or consisting of more than
one point. Everyone should get examples satisfying the possible combina-
tions.

3.8 Proposition. Let (X,d) be a complete metric space and let Y eX. Then
(Y, d) is a complete metric space iff Y is closed in X.

Proof. It is left as an exercise to show that (Y,d) is complete whenever Y is
a closed subset. Now assume (Y,d) to be complete; let Xo be a limit point
of Y. Then there is a sequence {yn} of points in Y such that Xo = limyn'
Hence {yn} is a Cauchy sequence (Exercise 5) and must converge to a
point Yo in Y, since (Y,d) is complete. It follows that Yo=xo and so Y contains all its limit points. Hence Y is closed by Proposition 3.4. •

§4. Compactness

The concept of compactness is an extension of the benefits of finiteness to infinite sets. Most properties of compact sets are analogues of properties of finite sets which are quite trivial. For example, every sequence in a finite set has a convergent subsequence. This is quite trivial since there must be at least one point which is repeated an infinite number of times. However the same statement remains true if "finite" is replaced by "compact."

4.1 Definition. A subset K of a metric space X is compact if for every collection ~ of open sets in X with the property

4.2

U Kc {G:GE~},

there is a finite number of sets G1, ••• , Gn in ~ such that K c G1 U G2 U ... U Gn• A collection of sets ~ satisfying (4.2) is called a cover of K; if each member of ~ is an open set it is called an open cover of K.
Clearly the empty set and all finite sets are compact. An example of a
{Z: non compact set is D = {z E IC: Izi < I}. If G. = Izi < 1 - ~} for n =

2, 3, ... , then {G2 , G 3 , ••• } is an open cover of D for which there is no finite subcover.

4.3 Proposition. Let K be a compact subset of X; then: (a) K is closed; (b) ifF is closed and Fe K then F is compact.

To prove part (b) let f§ be an open cover of F. Then, since F is closed, f§ U {X-F} is an open cover of K. Let G1, ••. , Gn be sets in f§ such that K c Gl U ... U Gn U (X -F). Clearly, Fe G1 U ... U Gn and so F is compact. •
If .'F is a collection of subsets of X we say that .'F has the finite intersection property (f.i.p.) if whenever {Fl' F2, ... , Fn} c .'F, Fl n F2 n ... n Fn =1= D. An example of such a collection is {D - G2 , D - G3 , ••• } where the sets Gn are as in the example preceding Proposition 4.3.

subsets of K with the fi.p. has {F: FE.'F} =1= D·

Proof Suppose K is compact and .'F is a collection of closed subsets of K
n having the f.i.p. Assume that {F: FE.'F} = D and let f§ = {X - F:
U n FE.'F}. Then, {X-F: FE.'F} = X - {F: FE.'F} = X by the

an + I, ..• } also has no limit points. But if a set has no limit points it contains

all its limits points and must be closed! Thus, each Fn is closed and {Fn:

4.7 Definition. A metric space (X, d) is sequentially compact if every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence.

'1J is an open cover of X thell there is an E > 0 such that if x is in X, there is a set G in 'lJ with Bex; IE) c G.

Proof The proof is by contradiction; suppose that 'lJ is an open cover of X and no such f' > 0 can be found. In particular, for every integer n there is a

1)' G point x" in X such that B(t"n; is not contained in any set in '1J. Since X

\

is sequentially compact there is a point Xo in X and a subsequence {xIIJ

such that Xo = lim x"". Let Go E 'lJ such that Xo E' Go and choose f' > 0

such that B(xo; E) C Go. Now let N be such that d(xo, xnJ < E/2 for all

11k :.?:: N. Let 11, be any integer larger than both Nand 2/E, and let y E' Bexnk ;

There are two ,common misinterpretations of Lebesgue's Covering

Lemma; one implies that it says nothing and the other that it says too much.

Since 'lJ is an open covering of X it follows that each x in X is contained in

some G in 'lJ. Thus there is an E > 0 such that B(x; E) C G since G is open.

The lemma. however, gives one E > 0 such that for any x, B(x; E) is con-

tained in some member of 'lJ. The other misinterpretation is to believe that

for the E > 0 obtained in the lemma. B(x; fc) is contained in each G in '!J

such that xc G.

4.9. Theorem. Let eX, d) be a metric space; then the following are equimlent statements:
(a) X is compact; (b) Every infinite set ill X has a limit point; (c) X is sequentially compact; (d) X is complete and for every E > 0 there are a finite number of points
x I, •.. , xn in X such that

UII

X =

B(xk ; fc).

k= 1

(The property mentioned in Cd) is called total boundedness.)

Proof That (a) implies (b) is the statement of Corollary 4.6. (b) implies (c): Let {XII} be a sequence in X and suppose, without loss of
generality, that the points Xj, X2 • ... are all distinct. By (b), the set {Xl' x 2 , ••• } has a limit point Xo' Thus there is a point x n , (B(xo; 1); similarly, there is an integer 112 > 111 with x n, E' B(x 0: 1/2). Continuing we get integers n! < 112 < ... , with X"k E B(xo; 11k). Thus, -'0 = lim x nk and X is sequentially compact.
(c) implies (d): To see that X is complete let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence, apply the definition of sequential compactness, and appeal to Exercise 3.8.
Now let € > 0 and fix Xl E' X. If X = B(x!; E) then we are done; otherwise choose X 2 EX -B(x!; E). Again, if X = B(x!; E) U B(x 2 ; E) we are done;

k= I

But this implies that for n # m, d(xn, xm) ;;.:: e > O. Thus {xn} can have no

convergent subsequence, contradicting (c).

(d) implies (c): This part of the proof will use a variation of the "pigeon

hole principle." This principle states that if you have more objects than you

have receptacles then at least one receptacle must hold more than one

object. Moreover, if you have an infinite number of points contained in a

finite number of balls then one ball contains infinitely many points. So

part (d) says that for every E > 0 and any infinite set in X, there is a point

Y E X such that B(y; e) contains infinitely many points of this set. Let {x,,}

be a sequence of distinct points. There is a point YI in X and a subsequence
{x~t)} of {xn} such that {x~l)} c B(YI; I). Also, there is a point Yz in X
and a subsequence {X~2)} of {x~l)} such that {x~)} c B(yz; t). Continuing,

for each integer k ;;.:: 2 there is a point Yk in X and a subsequence {~k)} of
{x~k-l)}suchthat {X~k)} c B(Yk; Ilk). LetFk = {x~k)}-;thendiamFk:5 21k

Xo (and {X~k)} is a subsequence of {x.}). In fact, Xo E Fk so that d(xo, k» :5

(c) implies (a): Let '!f be an open cover of X. The preceding lemma gives

an E > 0 such that for every x E X there is a G in ~ with R(x; e) c G. Now

(c) also implies (d); hence there are points XI>" • , Xn in X such that

X = B(xk ; €). Now for 1 :5 k :5 n there is a set Gk E '!f with B(xk ; e) c Gk •

4.10 Heine-Borel Theorem. A subset K oflR" (n ;;.:: 1) is compact iff K is closed
and bounded.
Proof. If K is compact then K is totally bounded by part (d) of the preceding theorem. It follows that K must be closed (Proposition 4.3); also, it is easy to show that a totally bounded set is also bounded.
Now suppose that K is closed and bounded. Hence there are real numbers al, ... ,an and bl, ... ,bn such that KcF=[al,b;lX ... X [a",bnl. If it can be shown that F is compact then, because K is closed, it follows that K is compact (Proposition 4.3(b». Since Rn is complete and F is dosed it follows that F is complete. Hence, again using part (d) of the preceding theorem we need only show that F is totally bounded. This is easy although somewhat "messy" to write down. Let (>0; we now will write F as the union of n-dimensional rectangles each of diameter less than f.

§5. Continuity
One of the most elementary properties of a function is continuity. The presence of continuity guarantees a certain degree of regularity and smoothness without which it is difficult to obtain any theory of functions on a metric space. Since the main subject of this book is the theory of functions of a complex variable which possess derivatives (and so are continuous), the study of continuity is basic.
° 5.1 Definition. Let eX, d) and (0, p) be metric spaces and let f: X -+ be
° a function. If a E X and W EO, then limf(x) = w if for every € > there is a
° ° X-wl
S > such that p(f(x), w) < € whenever < d(x, a) < S. The function f is
continuous at the point a if limf(x) = f(a). Iffis continuous at each point of
X-WI
X then f is a continuous function from X to 0.
5.2 Proposition. Let f: (X, d) -+ (0, p) be a function and a E X, Ct = f(a).
The following are equivalent statements: (a) f is continuous at a;
(b) For every € > O,f-l(B(Ct; €» contains a ball with center at a;
(c) Ct = limf(x.) whenever a = lim x•.
The proof will be left as an exercise for the reader. That was the last proposition concerning continuity of a function at a

Continuity

point. From now on we will concern ourselves only with functions continuous

on all of X.

5.3 Proposition. Let f: (X, d) ~ (0, p) be a function. The following are
equivalent statements:
(a) fis continuous;
(b) If Ll is open in 0 then f-l(Ll) is open in X;
r (c) -If is closed in 0 then f- 1(r) is closed in X.

Proof (a) implies (b): Let Ll be open in 0 and let x Ef-l(Ll). If w = f(x) then w is in Ll; by definition, there is an E > 0 with B(w ; E) C Ll. Since f is
continuous, part (b) of the preceding proposition gives a 0 > 0 with B(x; 0)
c f-l(B(w; E» c f-l(Ll). Hence, f-l(Ll) is open. (b) implies (c): If reO is closed then let Ll = o-r. By (b),J-l(Ll) =
X-f-l(r) is open, so thatf-l(r) is closed.
(c) implies (a): Suppose there is a point x in X at whichfis not continuous. Then there is an E > 0 and a sequence {xn } such that p(f(xn), f(x» ~ E
for every n while x = lim xn• Let r = O-B(f(x); E); then r is closed and
each Xn is inf-l(f). Since (by (c»f-l(r) is closed we have x Ef-l(r). But
this implies p(f(x), f(x» ~ E > 0, a contradiction. •
The following type of result IS probably well understood by the reader
and so the proof is left as an exercise.

5.4 Proposition. Let f and g be continuous functions from X into C and let
IX, (3 EIC. Then IXf+ (3g and fg are both continuous. Also, fIg is continuous
provided g(x) of- 0 for every x in X.

5.5 Proposition. Letf: X ~ Yandg: Y ~Z be continuousfunctions. Then gof (where go f(x) = g(f(x») is a continuous function from X into Z.

Proof If U is open in Z then g-l(U) is open in Y; hence,J-l(g-l(U» =
(gaf)-I(U) is open in X . •

5.6 Definition. A function f: (X, d) ~ (0, p) is uniformly continuous if for every E > 0 there is a 0 > 0 (depending only on E) such that p(f(x),J(y» < E
whenever d(x, y) < o. We say thatfis a Lipschitzfunction if there is a constant
M > 0 such that p(f(x),J(y» :s; Md(x, y) for all x and y in X.
It is easy to see that every Lipschitz function is uniformly continuous.
In fact, if E is given, take 0 = ElM. It is even easier to see that every uniformly
continuous function is continuous. What are some examples of such func-
tions? If X = 0 = IR then f(x) = x 2 is continuous but not uniformly continuous. If X = 0 = [0, 1] then f(x) = xt is uniformly continuous but
is not a Lipschitz function. The following provides a wealthy supply of Lipschitz functions.
Let A be a non-empty subset of X and x E X; define the distance from x to the set A, d(x, A), by
d(x, A) = inf {d(x, a): a E A}.

5.7 Proposition. Let A be a non-empty subset of X; then:
(a) d(x, A) = d(x, A -);

26

Metric Spaces and the Topology of C

(b) d(x, A) = 0 iff x E A - ;

(c) Id(x, A) - dey, A)I ::::; d(x, y) for all x, y in X.

Proof (a) If A c B then it is clear from the definition that d(x, B) ::::; d(x, A). Hence, d(x, A -) ::::; d(x, A). On the other hand, if E > 0 there is a point y in A - such that d(x, A -) ~ d(x, y) - E/2. Also, there is a point a in A with dey, a) < E/2. But Id(x, y) - d(x, a)1 ::::; dey, a) < E/2 by the triangle inequality. In particular, d(x, y) > d(x, a)-E/2. This gives, d(x, A-) ~ d(x, a)-E ~ d(x, A) -E. Since E was arbitrary d(x, A -) ~ d(x, A), so that (a) is proved.
(b) If x E A - then 0 = d(x, A -) = d(x, A). Now for any x in X there is
a minimizing sequence {an} in A such that d(x, A) = lim d(x, an). So if
d(x, A) = 0, lim d(x, an) = 0; that is, x = lim an and so x E A -.
(c) For a in A d(x, a) ::::; d(x, y)+d(y, a). Hence, d(x, A) = inf {d(x, a):
a E A} ::::; inf {d(x, y) + dey, a): a E A} = d(x, y) + dey, A). This gives d(x, A)-
dey, A) ::::; d(x, y). Similarly dey, A) - d(x, A) ::::; d(x, y) so the desired in-
equality follows. • Notice that part (c) of the proposition says that f: X --+ IR defined by
f(x) = d(x, A) is a Lipschitz function. If we vary the set A we get a large
supply of these functions. It is not true that the product of two uniformly continuous (Lipschitz)
functions is again uniformly continuous (Lipschitz). For example, f(x) = x
is Lipschitz butfIis not even uniformly continuous. However ifbothfand g are bounded then the conclusion is valid (see Exercise 3).
Two of the most important properties of continuous functions are contained in the following result.

5.8 Theorem. Let f: (X, d) --+ (0, p) be a continuous function.
(a) If X is compact then f(X) is a compact subset of O. (b) If X is connected then f(X) is a connected subset of O.

Proof To prove (a) and (b) it may be supposed, without loss of generality,
that f(X) = O. (a) Let {wn } be a sequence in 0; then there is, for each n ~ 1, a point Xn in X with Wn = f(xn). Since X is compact there is a point x in X and a subsequence {xnJ such that x = lim x nk' But if W = f(x), then the continuity off gives that W = lim wnk ; hence 0 is compact by Theorem
4.9. (b) Suppose ~ c 0 is both open and closed in 0 and that ~ # D. Then, because/eX) = 0, D # /-1(~); also,f-l(~) is both open and closed
because / is continuous. By connectivity, /-1(~) = X and this gives 0 = ~.
Thus, 0 is connected. •
5.9 Corollary. If f: X --+ 0 is continuous and K c X is either compact or
connected in X then f(K) is compact or connected, respectively, in O.

5.10 Corollary. Iff: X ~ R is continuous and X is connected then f( X) is an interval.
This foIIows from the characterization of connected subsets of IR as intervals.

5.12 Corollary. Iff: X --+ IR is continuous and K c X is compact then there are points Xo and Yo in K withf(xo) = sup {f(x): x E K} andf(yo) = inf {f(x): XEK}.

Proof If IX = sup {f(x): x E K} then IX is in f(K) because f(K) is closed and bounded in IR. Similarly f3 = inf {f(x): x E K} is in f(K) . •

5.13 Corollary. If K c X is compact and f: X --+ C is continuous then there are points x 0 and Yo in K with
If(xo) I = sup {If(x)l: x E K} and If(Yo)1 = inf {If(x) I: x E K}. Proof This corollary follows from the preceding one because g(x) = If(x) I
defines a continuous function from X into IR.

5.14 Corollary. IfK is a non-empty compact subset ofX and x is in X then there is a point y in K with d(x, y) = d(x, K).
Proof Define f: X --+ IR by fey) = d(x, y). Then f is continuous and, by
Corollary 5.12, assumes a minimum value on K. That is, there is a point y in K with fey) :::; fez) for every Z E K. This gives d(x, y) = d(x, K). •
The next two theorems are extremely important and will be used repeatedly throughout this book with no specific reference to the theorem numbers.

5.15. Theorem. Suppose f: X --+ Q is continuous and X is compact; then f is uniformly continuous.

Proof Let E > 0; we wish to find a 8 > 0 such that d(x, y) < 8 implies
p(f(x), fey)) < E. Suppose there is no such 8; in particular, each 8 = lin
will fail to work. Then for every n ~ I there are points Xn and Yn in X with d(xn> Yn) < lin but p(f(xn), f(Yn)) ~ E. Since X is compact there is a sub-
sequence {xnJ and a point x E X with x = lim xnk.
Claim. x = lim Ynk. In fact, d(x, Ynk) :::; d(x, xnJ+ link and this tends to zero
as k goes to 00.
But if w = f(x), w = lim f(xnJ = lim f(YnJ so that

E :::; p(f(xnJ,J(Ynk))

:::; p(f(xnJ, w)+p(w,J(ynJ)

and the right hand side of this inequality goes to zero. This is a contradiction and completes the proof. •

5.16. Definition. If A and B are non-empty subsets of X then define the distance from A to B, dCA, B), by
dCA, B) = inf {dCa, b): a E A, b E B}. Notice that if B is the single-point set {x} then dCA, {x}) = d(x, A). If

28

Metric Spaces and the Topology of C

A = {y} and B = {x} then d( {x}, {y}) = d(x, y). Also, if A n B of. [:

then dCA, B) = 0, but we can have dCA, B) = 0 with A and B disjoint. The

most popular type of example is to take A = {(x, 0): x E SIl} C IFR2 and

B = {ex, eX): x E SIl}. Notice that A and B are both closed and disjoint and

still dCA, B) = O.

5.17 Theorem. If A and B are non-empty di!Jjoint sets in X with B closed and A compact then dCA, B) > O.

Proof DefineJ: )(+ SIl byJ(x) = d(x, B). Since A n B = ::::J and B is closed, J(a) > 0 for each a in A. But since A is compact there is a point a in A such
that 0 < J(a) = inf {f(x): x E A} = dCA, B). III

§1. Power series

In this section the definition and basic properties of a power series will

be given. The power series will then be used to give examples of analytic

functions. Before doing this it is necessary to give some elementary facts on

infinite series in C whose statements for infinite series in IR should be well

00
known to the reader. If an is in C for every n ~ 0 then the series L an

m

n~O

converges to Z iff for every E > 0 there is an integer N such that I Lan - zl < E

whenever m ~ N. The series L an converges absolutely if L

n=O lanl converges.

1.1 Proposition. If L an converges absolutely then L an converges.

Proof Let E > 0 and put Zn = aO+a1 +... +an" Since L lanl converges
00
there is an integer N such that L lanl < E. Thus, if m > k ~ N, n=N

That is, {zn} is a Cauchy sequence and so there is a Z in C with Z = lim Zn.
Hence Lan = z.•
Also recall the definitions of limit inferior and superior of a sequence in IR. If {an} is a sequence in IR then define

lim inf an = lim [inf {an> an+1 , ••• }]
n~oo

lim sup an = lim [sup {an> an+1 , ••• }]
n~oo

An alternate notation for lim inf an and lim sup an is lim an and lim an" If

bn = inf {an> an + 1 , ••• } then {bn } is an increasing sequence of real numbers or {- oo}. Hence, lim inf an always exists although it may be ± 00. Similarly

lim sup an always exists although it may be ± 00.

A number of properties of lim inf and lim sup are included in the exercises

of this section.

to explore the convergence properties of power series.

1.3 Theorem. For a given power series anCz-a)n define the number R,

o ::; R ::; 00, by

n= 0

~ = lim sup lanll!n,

then:

(a) if Iz-al < R, the series converges absolutely: (b) if Iz-al > R, the terms of the series become unbounded and so the
series diverges;
(c) if 0 < r < R then the series converges uniformly on {z: Iz - al ::; r}.
Moreover, the number R is the only number having properties (a) and (b).

Proof We may suppose that a = O. If Izl < R there is an r with Izl < r < R.

! Thus, there is an integer N such that lanl l!. < for all n ~ N (because ~ >

the power series converges absolutely for each Izl < R.

Now suppose r < R and choose p such that r < p < R. As above, let

(~) < 1. Hence the Weierstrass M-test gives that the power series converges

L Since Izi < r we get that lanz"1 is dominated by a convergent series and

On the other hand if Izl > r > ex, then lanl < rlan + 11 for all n larger than

some integer N. As before, we get jan," 1 ::::: B = jaNrNI for n ::::: N. This

gives lanz"1 ::::: B 11;11: which approaches 00 as n does. Hence, L a.z" diverges

§2. Analytic functions

In this section analytic functions are defined and some examples are given. It is also shown that the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function.

2.1 Definition. If G is an open set in C and f: G~C then f is differentiable

at a point a in G if

lim f'---.:a(c-_+---,h)'-----=-P---'-a(--,-)

h~O

h

exists; the value of this limit is denoted by f'(a) and is called the derivative of . f at a. Iff is differentiable at each point of G we say that f is differentiable on G. Notice that if f is differentiable on G then f'(a) defines a function f': G -+ Co Iff' is continuous then we say thatfis continuously differentiable. Iff' is differentiable then f is twice differentiable; continuing, a differentiable function such that each successive derivative is again differentiable is called infinitely differentiable.
(Henceforward, all functions will be assumed to take their values in C unless it is stated to the contrary.)

2.3 Definition. A function I: G--.IC is analytic if I is continuously differen-
tiable on G.
It follows readily, as in calculus. that sums and products of functions
analytic on G are analytic. Also, if I and g are analytic on G and GI is the
set of points in G where g doesn't vanish, thenl/g is analytic on GI . Since constant functions and the function z are clearly analytic it
follows that all rational functions are analytic on the complement of the set of zeros of the denominator.
Moreover, the usual laws for differentiating sums, products, and quotients remain valid.

2.4 Chain Rule. Let I and g be analytic on G and Q respective(v and suppose
I(G)c Q. Then gal is analytic on G and (gof)'(z) = g'(f(z) )/'(z)
for all z in G.

Proof. Fix Zo in G and choose a positive number r such that B (zo; r) c G. We must show that if O<lhnl<r and limhn=O then lim{hn-'[g(f(zo+hn» - g(f(zo»]} exists and equals g'(f(zo))f'(zo). (Why will this suffice for a proof?)

Case 1 Supposef(zoh!=/(zo+hn) for all n. In this case gof(zo+ hn ) - gof(zo) g(f(zo+ hn ) - g(f(zo)) J(zo+ hn ) -J(zo)

Since lim[f(zo + hn ) - J(zo)] = 0 by (2.2) we have that
limhn- I[ gof(zo + hn } - goJ(zo) ] = g'(f(zo»/'(zo)
*' Case 2 J(zo)= J(zo+ hn ) for infinitely many values of n. Write {hn} as the union of two sequences {kn} and {In} where f (zo) J(zo+kn ) andf(zo)=J(zo+!n) for all n. SinceJis differentiable, f'(zo) =
lim ',,-IU(ZO + In) - J(zo)] =0. Also liml,,-I[ goJ(zo + In) - goJ(zo)] =o. By
Case I, lim kn- 1[ gof(zo + kn ) - goJ(zo)] = gl(f(ZO»/'(zo) = O. Therefore limh,,-I[ gof(zo + h,,) - goJ(zo)] =0= gl(f(ZO»/'(zo)'
The general case easily follows from the preceding two. II
In order to define the derivative, the function was assumed to be defined
on an open set. If we say f is analytic on a set A and A is not open, we mean that f is analytic on an open set containing A.

Analytic functions

35

Perhaps the definition of analytic function has been anticlimatic to many readers. After seeing books written on analytic functions and year-long courses and seminars on the theory of analytic functions, one can excuse a certain degree of disappointment in discovering that the definition has already been encountered in calculus. Is this theory to be a simple generalization of calculus? The answer is a resounding no. To show how vastly different the two subjects are let us mention that we will show that a differentiable function is analytic. This is truly a remarkable result and one for which there is no analogue in the theory of functions of a real variable (e.g., consider
~) x 2 sin . Another equally remarkable result is that every analytic function

is infinitely differentiable and, furthermore, has a power series expansion about each point of its domain. How can such a humble hypothesis give such
far-reaching results? One can get some indication of what produces this phenomenon if one considers the definition of derivative.
In the complex variable case there are any infinity of directions in which
a variable can approach a point a. In the real case, however, there are only two avenues of approach. Continuity of a function defined on ~, for
example. can be discussed in terms of right and left continuity; this is far
from the case for functions of a complex variable. So the statement that a function of a complex variable has a derivative is stronger than the same statement about a function of a real variable. Even more, if we consider a
function f defined on Gee as a function of two real variables by putting g(x, y) = f(x + iy) for (x, y) E G, then requiring that g be Frechet differentiable will not ensure that f has a derivative in our sense.
In an exercise we ask the reader to show thatf(z) = Izl2 has a derivative
only at z = 0; but, g(x, y) = f(x + iy) = x 2 +y2 is Frechet differentiable.
That differentiability implies analyticity is proved in Chapter IV; but right now we prove that power series are analytic functions.

(c) By a straightforward evaluation we get f(O) = f(O)(O) = aQ. Using

Hence. expz = zn / n! is analytic in C. Before further examining the

exponential function and defining cosz and sinz. the following result must

be proved.

2.10 Proposition. If G is open and connected and f:G -» C is differentiable
with !'(z) = 0 for all z in G, then f is constant.
Proof Fix z 0 in G and let Wo = fez 0)' Put A = {z E G: fez) = wo}; we will
show that A = G by showing that A is both open and closed in G. Let z E G and let {zn} c A be such that z = lim Zn' Since f(z.) = Wo for each n ~ 1 andfis continuous we getf(z) = Wo, or z E A. Thus, A is closed in G. Now
fix a in A, and let IE > 0 be such that BCa; E) c G. If z E B(a; £), set g(t) =
f(tz+(l-t)a), 0 ::; t ::; 1. Then

Putg(z) = eZea-Zfor some fixed ain C; theng'(z) = eZea-z+eZ(_ea-z) = O.

Hence g(z) = w for all z in C and some constant w. In particular, using
eO = 1 we get w = g(O) = ea. Then eZea- z = ea for all z. Thus ea +b = eaeb
for all a and b in IC. This also gives 1 = eZe- Z which implies that eZ # 0
for any z and e- Z = ljez• Returning to the power series expansion of et ,
since all the coefficients of this series are real we have exp z = exp z. In
particular, for (J a real number we get le wl2 = eiOe- iO = eO = l. More
generally, lez I2 = eZe' = ezH = exp (2 Re z). Thus,

2.13

iexp z! = exp (Re z).

We see, therefore, that eZ has the same properties that the real function eX has. Again by analogy with the real power series we define the functions cos z and sin z by the power series

Each of the series has infinite radius of convergence and so cos z and sin z are analytic in IC. By using Proposition 2.5 we find that (cos z)' = - sin z
and (sin z)' = cos z. By manipulating power series (which is justified since
these series converge absolutely)

2.14

cos z = J(eiz + e - iz) sm- z = 21i (eiz _... e - iz)

This gives for z in C, cos 2 z + sin 2 z = 1 and

2.15

eiz = cos z+ i sin z.

In particular if we let z = a real number (J in (2.15) we get eiO = cis (J.
Hence, for z in IC

where B=argz. Since eX+IY=exe'Y we have lezl=exp(Rez) and arge z =

A functionfisperiodic with period c iff(z+c)=f(z) for all z in IC. If c is a period of e Z then eZ=ez+c=ezec implies that e C = 1. Since I =lecl= expRe(c), Re(c)=O. Thus c=i(} for some B in IR. But !=ec=eil1=cosB+ i sin () gives that the periods of e Z are the multiples of 2wi. Thus, if we divide the plane into infinitely many horizontal strips by the lines Imz = w(2k - I), k any integer, the exponential function behaves the same in each of these strips. This property of periodicity is one which is not present in the real exponential function. Notice that by examining complex functions we have demonstrated a relationship (2.15) between the exponential function and the trigonometric functions which was not expected from our knowledge of the real case.

Now let us define log z. We could adopt the same procedure as before
and let log z be the power series expansion of the real logarithm about some
point. But this only gives log z in some disk. The method of defining the logarithm as the integral of t- 1 from 1 to x, x > 0, is a possibility, but proves to be risky and unsatisfying in the complex case. Also, since e" is not
a one-one map as in the real case, log z cannot be defined as the inverse of e".
We can, however, do something similar.
We want to define log w so that it satisfies w = e" when z = log w.
Now since eZ =f. 0 for any z we cannot define log O. Therefore, suppose e" = w
and w =f. 0; if z = x+iy then Iwl = e" and y = arg w+211'k, for some k.
Hence

2.17

{log Iwl +i(arg w+211'k): k is any integer}

is the solution set for e" = w. (Note that log Iwl is the usual real logarithm.)

2.18 Definition. If G is an open connected set in C and /: G -+- C is a con-
tinuous function such that z = exp /(z) for all z in G then / is a branch 0/
the logarithm.
Notice that 0, G. Suppose / is a given branch of the logarithm on the connected set G
and suppose k is an integer. Let g(z) = /(z) +211'ki. Then exp g(z) = exp/(z)
= z, so g is also a branch of the logarithm. Conversely. if/and g are both
branches of log z then for each z in G,/(z) = g(z) +211'ki for some integer k,
where k depends on z. Does the same k work for each z in G? The answer is
yes. In fact, if h(z) = -12.[/(z)-g(z)] then h is continuous on G and h(G)
11'1
C I, the integers. Since G is connected, h(G) must also be connected (Theorem II. 5.8). Hence there is a k in I with/(z) + 211'ki = g(z) for all z in G. This gives

2.19 Proposition. I f G c C is open and connected and f is a branch of log z on G then the totality 0/ branches 0/ log z are the functions /(z) + 211'ki, k e Z.
Now let us manufacture at least one branch of log z on some open connected set. Let
G=C-{ZEIR:Z:S:O};
that is, "slit" the plane along the negative real axis. Clearly G is connected
and each z in G can be uniquely represented by z = Izle" where -11' < 8 < 11'.
For 8 in this range, define f(re" ) = log r+i8. We leave the proof of continuity to the reader (Exercise 9). It follows that/is a branch ofthe logarithm onG.
Is/analytic? To answer this we first prove a general fact.
2.20 Proposition. Let G and n be open subsets of C. Suppose that /: G -+- C and g: n -+- C are continuous functions such that /(G) c nand g(f(z» = z
for all z in G. If g is differentiable and g'(z) =f. 0, / is differentiable and
I'(z) = g'~(Z»

exists since g'(f(a» # 0, and I = g'(j(a»f'(a).
Thus,f'(z) = [g'(f(z))J -1. If g is analytic then g' is continuous and this
gives that f is analytic. III

2.21 Corollary. A branch of the logarithm function is analytic and its derivative is Z-I.
We designate the particular branch of the logarithm defined above on C - {z E ~: z< O} to be the principal branch of the logarithm. If we write
log z as a function we will always take it to be the principal branch of the
logarithm unless otherwise stated. Iff is a branch of the logarithm on an open connected set G and if b in C
is fixed then deline g: G --+ C by g(z) = exp (bICz». If b is an integer, then g(z) = z/'. In this manner we define a branch of Zb, b in C, for an open connected set on which there is a branch of log z. If we write g(z) = Zb as a function we will always understand that Zb = exp (b log z) where log z is the principal branch of the logarithm; Zb is analytic since log z is.
As is evident from the considerations just concluded, connectedness plays an important role in analytic function theory. For example, Proposition 2.W is false unless G is connected. This is analogous to the role played by intervals in calculus. Because of this it is convenient to introduce the term "region." A region is an open connected subset of the plane.
This section concludes with a discussion of the Cauchy-Riemann equa-
tions. Let f: G --+ C be analytic and let u(x, y) = Re f(x + iy), vex, y) = 1m
./(x+iy) for x+iy in G. Let us evaluate the limit

Hence, 2.25

Any real-valued function with continuous second derivatives satisfying (2.25)
is said to be harmonic. In a similar fashion, v is also harmonic. We will study harmonic functions in Chapter X.
Let G be a region in the plane and let u and v be functions defined on
G with continuous partial derivatives. Furthermore, suppose that u and v satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Ifj(z)=u(z)+iv(z) thenjcan be
shown to be analytic in G. To see this, let z = x + ry E G and let B (z; r) c
G. If h=s+it E B(O;r) then

u(x+s, y+t)-u(x, y) = [u(x+s, y+t)-u(x, y+t)]+[u(x, y+t)-u(x, y)]

In light of (2.27) and (2.28), f is differentiable and 1"(z) = ux(z) + iv.Jz). Since Ux and Vx are continuous, 1" is continuous and f is analytic. These
results are summarized as follows.

2.29. Theorem. Let u and v be real-valued functions defined on a region G
and suppose that u and v have contilluous partial derivatives. Then f: G --;- IC
defined by fez) = u(z) + iv(z) is analytic iff u and v satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann
equations.

Example. Is u(x, y) = log (Xl +y2)t harmonic on G = IC - {O}? The answer
is yes! This could be shown by differentiating u to see that it satisfies (2.25). However, it can also be shown by observing that in a neighborhood of each point of G, u is the real part of an analytic function defined in that neighborhood. (Which function?)
Another problem concerning harmonic functions which will be taken up in more detail in Section VIII. 3, is the following. Suppose G is a region in the plane and u: G --;- IR is harmonic. Does there exist a harmonic function v: G --;- IR such thatf = u+ iv is analytic in G? If such a function v exists it is called a harmonic conjugate of u. If VI and V2 are two harmonic conjugates of u then i(v j -v2 ) = (u+ivj)-(U+iv2) is analytic on G and only takes on

Analytic functions

43

purely imaginary values. It follows that two harmonic conjugates of a

harmonic function differ by a constant (see Exercise 14).
Returning to the question of the existence of a harmonic conjugate, the
above example u(z) = log Izl of a harmonic function on the region G = C-
{O} has no harmonic conjugate. Indeed, if it did then it would be possible to

define an analytic branch of the logarithm on G and this cannot be done.

(Exercise 21.) However, there are some regions for which every harmonic

function has a conjugate. In particular, it will now be shown that this is the

case when G is any disk or the whole plane.

2.30 Theorem. Let G be either the whole plane C or some open disk. If
u: G -7 IR is a harmonic function then u has a harmonic conjugate.

Proof To carry out the proof of this theorem, Leibniz's rule for differentiating under the integral sign is needed (this is stated and proved in Proposition IV.
2.1). Let G = B(O; R), 0 < R :-:; 00, and let u: G -7 IR be a harmonic function.
The proof will be accomplished by finding a harmonic function v such that u and v satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. So define

f y
vex, y) = uix, t)dt+cp(x)
o
and determine cp so that Vx = -uy. Differentiating both sides of this equation
with respect to x gives
f y
vix, y) = uxix, t) dt+tp'(x) o
-fy Uyy(x, t) dt+cp'(x) o
-u/x, y)+u/x, 0) +cp'(x)

So it must be that cp'(x) = - uy(x, 0). It is easily checked that u and

do satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. • Where was the fact that G is a disk or C used? Why can't this method of
proof be doctored sufficiently that it holds for general regions G? Where
does the proof break down when G = C- {O} and u(z) = log Izl?

§3. Analytic functions as mappings. Mobius transformations
Consider the function defined by fez) = Z2. If z = x+iy and /L+iv=f(z) then /L = x 2- y2, v = 2xy. Hence, the hyperbolas x 2- y2 = c and 2xy = d are mapped by f into the straight lines /L = c, v = d. One interesting fact is

Analytic functions as mappings. Mobius transformations

45

that for c and d not zero, these hyperbolas intersect at right angles, just as
their images do. This is not an isolated phenomenon and this property will
be explored in general later in this section. Now examine what happens to the lines x = c and y = d. First consider
x = c(y arbitrary) ;fmaps this line into fL = c2 - y2 and v = 2cy. Eliminating y we get that x = c is mapped onto the parabola v2 = - 4C2(fL - ( 2 ). Similarly,
1 takes the line y = d onto the parabola v2 = 4d2(fL + d 2). These parabolas
intersect at (c 2 - d2 , ±21 cd!). It is relevant to point out that as c ~ 0 the
parabola jJ2 = -4c 2(1l - c2 ) gets closer and closer to the negative real axis. This corresponds to the fact that the function z~ maps G = C - {z EO IR: z~o} onto {z: Rez>O}. Notice also that x=c and x= -c (and y = d. y = - d) are mapped onto the same parabolas.
What happens to a circle centered at the origin? If z = re iB then I(z) =
r2e2 ;8; thus, the circle of radius r about the origin is mapped onto the circle of radius r2 in a two to one fashion.
Finally, what happens to the sector Sea, (3) = {z: a < arg z < {3}, for a < f3? It is easily seen that the image of Sea, (3) is the sector S(2a, 2(3). The restriction of 1 to S(a, (3) will be one-one exactly when f3 - a < 1T.
The above discussion sheds some light on the nature of I( z) = Z 2 and,
likewise, it is useful to study the mapping properties of other analytic
functions. In the theory of analytic functions the following problem holds a
paramount position: given two open connected sets G and Q, is there an
analytic function I defined on G such that I( G) = Q? Besides being
intrinsically interesting, the solution (or rather, the information about the
existence of a solution) of this problem is very useful.

3.1. Definition. A path in a region Gee is a continuous function y: [a, b] _.-> G for some interval [a, bJ in IR. If y'(t) exists for each t in [a, b]
and y': [a, b] -> C is continuous then y is a smooth path. Also y is
piecewise smooth if there is a partition of [a, b], a = to < t[ < ... < t" = b,
tJ, such that y is smooth on each subinterval [f}_I' 1 ~j ~ n.
To say that a function y: la, b] -> C has a derivative y'(t) for each
point t in [a, b] means that

. y{l+h)-y(t) l~ _·······)-1- _... =Y'(l)

exists for a < t < b and that the right and left sided limits exist for t = a and t = b, respectively. This is, of course, equivalent to saying that Rey and
1m y have a derivative (see Appendix A). Suppose y:[a,b]-,G is a smooth path and that for some to in (a,b),
y'(to) 7'" O. Then y has a tangent line at the point zo= yUo). This line goes through the point Zo in the direction of (the vector) y'(lo); or, the slope of the line is tan(argy'(to». If y, and Y2 are two smooth paths with y,«(,)= Y2(t2)=zO and y;(I,)7"'O, y;(l2)7"'0, then define the angle between the paths y, and Y2 at Zo to be

Suppose y is a smooth path in G andJ: G-C is analytic. Then (1= Joy
is also a smooth path and (1'(t)=f'(y(t»y'(t). Let zo=y(to), and suppose that y'(to)*O and f'(zo)*O; then (1'(to)*O and arg(1'(to)=argJ'(zo)+ argy'(to). That is,

3.2

arg(1'(to) - arg y'( to) = argJ'(zo)·

Now let YI and Y2 be smooth paths with YI(t I)= yi t 2) = Zo and y;(tI)* 0* y;(t2); let (11 = JOYI and (12 = J O Y2. Also, suppose that the paths YI and Y2 are not tangent to each other at zo; that is, suppose y;UI)*y;(t2). Equation (3.2) gives
3.3
This says that given any two paths through f z 0, maps these paths onto two paths through Wo = f(zo) and, whenJ'(zo) 'f 0, the angles between the curves
are preserved both in magnitude and direction. This summarizes as follows.

3.4 Theorem. Iff: G - IC is analytic then f preserves angles at each point Zo of G where J'(zo) 'f O.
A functionf: G - IC which has the angle preserving property and also has

existing is called a conformal map. If f is analytic and J'(z) 'f 0 for any z
then f is conformal. The converse of this statement is also true.

nential function more closely. If z = c+iy where c is fixed thenf(z) = re iy for r = eC• That is, f maps the line x = c onto the circle with center at the origin and of radius eC• Also, f maps the line y = d onto the infinite ray

the circle {e(e ill : -17 < () < 17}, and the horizontal line y = d, -17 < d < 17, goes onto the ray making an angle d with the positive real axis.
Notice that log z, the principal branch of the logarithm, does the opposite.
It maps n onto the strip G, circles onto vertical segments in G, rays onto
horizontal lines in G. The exploration of the mapping properties of cos z, sin z, and other
analytic functions will be done in the exercises. We now proceed to an amazing class of mappings, the Mobius transformations.

3.5 Definition. A mapping of the form S(z) = az+db is called a linear fraeez+
tional transformation. If a, b, c, and d also satisfy ad-be 1= 0 then S(z) is called a Mobius transformation.
If S is a Mobius transformation then S-I(Z) = dz-b satisfies
-ez+a
S(S -I(Z» = S -I(S(Z» = z; that is, S -I is the inverse mapping of S. If
Sand T are both linear fractional transformations then it follows that SoT is also. Hence, the set of Mobius maps forms a group under composition. Unless otherwise stated, the only linear fractional transformations we will consider are Mobius transformations.
Let S(z) = az+db ; if ,\ is any non-zero complex number, then ez+
S(z) = ('\a)z+(Ab) .
('\e)z +(M)
That is, the coefficients a, b, e, d are not unique (see Exercise 20). We may also consider S as defined on Coo with S( (0) = ale and S( -die)
= 00. (Notice that we cannot have a = 0 = e or d = 0 = e since either situation would contradict ad-be 1= 0.) Since S has an inverse it maps Coo onto Coo.
If S(z) = z + a then S is called a translation; if S(z) = az with a > 0
then S is a dilation; if S(z) = eillz then it is a rotation; finally, if S(z) = liz it is the inversion.
3.6 Proposition. If S is a Mobius transformation then S is the composition of
translations, dilations, and the inversion. (Of course, some of these may be missing.)
Proof. First, suppose e = O. Hence S(z) = (ald)z+(bld) so if Sl(Z) = (ald)z,
S2(Z) = z+(bld), then S2 0 Sl = S and we are done.
(be-ad) Now let e 1= 0 and put Sl(Z) = z+d/e, S2(Z) = liz, S3(Z) = 2 z,
e S4(Z) = z+a/e. Then S = S4 0 S3 0 S2° Sl' •
What are the finite fixed points of S? That is, what are the points z satisfying S(z)=z. If z satisfies this condition then
ez2+{d-a)z-b = O.

Elementary Properties and Examples of Analytic Functions

Hence, a Mobius transformation can have at most two fixed points unless S(z)=z for all z. (Why?)
Now let S be a Mobius transformation and let a, b, c be distinct points
in Coo with IX = S(a), f3 = S(b), y = S(c). Suppose that T is another map
with this property. Then T- 1 0 S has a, b, and c as fixed points and, therefore, T- 1 0 S = I = the identity. That is, S = T. Hence, a Mobius map is
uniquely determined by its action on any three given points in Coo.
Let Z2' Z3' Z4 be points in COO" Define S: Coo -+ Coo by

Z-Z3 S(z) = ~ if Zz = 00;
Z-Z4

S(z)

Z2- Z4
=--

if

Z3 = 00',

Z-Z4

Z-Z3 S(z) = - - if Z4 = 00.
Z2 -Z3

In any case S(zz) = I, S(Z3) = 0, S(Z4) = 00 and S is the only transforma-
tion having this property.

3.7 Definition. If Z1 E C DC then (z l' Z2' Z 3' Z4) (The cross ratio of ZI' Z2' Z3' and Z4) is the image of Zl under the unique Mobius transformation which takes z2 to 1, Z3 to 0, and Z4 to 00.
For example: (Z2' Z2' Z3' Z4) = 1 and (z, 1,0, (0) = z. Also, if M is any Mobius map and Wb W3' 1V4 are the points such that MW2 = I, MWj = 0,
MW4 = 00 then Mz = (z, IVz, W3' 1V4).
3.8 Proposition. If Z2' Z3' Z4 are distinct points and T is any Mobius trans-
formation then

for any point Z l'
Proof Let Sz = (z, ZZ, Z3' Z4); then S is a Mobius map. If M = ST- 1 then M(Tz z) = I, M(Tz3) = 0, M(Tz 4) = 00; hence, ST-1z = (z, Tz 2,
Tz 3, Tz4) for all z in COO" In particular, if z = Tz I the desired result follows. •
3.9 Proposition. If z 2, Z3, Z4 are distinct points in Coo and W2, w3, w4 are also distinct points of Coo, then there is one and only one Mobius transformation S such that SZz = W2, SZ3 = W3' SZ4 = W4
Proof Let Tz = (z, Z2' Z3' Z4), Mz = (z, wz, W3' w4) and put S = M-1T. Clearly S has the desired property. If R is another Mobius map with Rzj = W j for j = 2, 3,4 then R- 1 0 S has three fixed points (zz, Z3' and Z4)' Hence R -loS = I, or S = R. •
It is well known from high school geometry that three points in the plane determine a circle. (Recall that a circle in Coo passing through 00 corresponds to a straight line in Co Hence there is no need to inject in the previous state-

ment the word "non-colinear". A straight line in the plane will be called a

circle. The next result explains when four points lie on a circle.

3.10 Proposition. Let ZI' zz, Z3, Z4 be four distinct points in Coo. Then (ZI, Z2' Z 3, Z4) is a real number iff all four points lie on a circle.

Proof Let S: Coo -+ Coo be defined by Sz = (z, Z2' Z3' Z4); then S-I(!R) = the
set of z such that (z, Zz, Z3' Z4) is real. Hence, we will be finished if we can show that the image of !Roo under a Mobius transformation is a circle.

(ac-iic) Iwlz+(ad-bc)w+(bc-dii)w+(bd-bd) = O.

If ac is real then ac-iic = 0; putting IX = 2(ad-bc), f3 = i(bd-hd) and
multiplying (3.11) by i gives

3.12

0= 1m (lXw)-f3 = 1m (lXw-f3)

since f3 is real. That is, w lies on the line determined by (3.12) for fixed ex and f3. If ac is not real then (3.11) becomes

for some constants y in C, I) in !R. Hence,

where

l A = (lyl2 +I)t = -a_d--b_cl > O. ac-ac

Since y and Aare independent of x and since (3.13) is the equation of a circle, the proof is finished. •

3.14 Theorem. A Mobius transformation takes circles onto circles.

Proof Let r be any circle in Coo and let S be any Mobius transformation.
Let Z2' Z3' Z4 be three distinct points on r and put Wj = SZj forj = 2,3,4.
Then W2, W3, W4 determine a circle r'. We claim that S(r) = r'. In fact, for any Z in Coo
3.15
by Proposition 3.8. By the preceding proposition, if Z is on r then both sides of (3.15) are real. But this says that Sz E r'. •
Now let rand r' be two circles in Coo and let Z2' Z3' Z4 E r; W2, W3, W4 E r'. Put Rz = (z, Z2, Z3' Z4), Sz = (z, W2' W3, w4)' Then T = S-l 0 R maps

I' onto 1". In fact, Tz j = W j for j = 2, 3, 4 and, as in the above proof, it follows that T(r) = 1".

3.16 Proposition. For any given circles I' and I" in CoO there is a Mobius
transformation T such that T(r) = I". Furthermore we can specify that T
take any three points on r onto any three points of I". if we do specify Tzj
for j = 2, 3, 4 (distinct Z j in r) then T is unique.

Proof The proof, except for the uniqueness statement, is given in the previous
paragraph. The uniqueness part is a trivial exercise for the reader. II
Now that we know that a Mobius map takes circles to circles, the next question is: What happens to the inside and the outside of these circles? To answer this we introduce some new concepts.
3.17 Definition. Let r be a circle through points Z2, Z3' Z4' The points z,
z* in CO) are said to be symmetric with respect to I' if

3.18

As it stands, this definition not only depends on the circle but also on the
points Z2' z 3' Z4-,It is left as an exercise for the reader to show that symmetry
is independent of the points chosen (Exercise 11).
Also, by Proposition 3.10 z is symmetric to itself with respect to r if and only if Z E r.

r Let us investigate what it means for z and Z* to be symmetric. If is a
straight line then our linguistic prejudices lead us to believe that z and z*
are symmetric with respect to r if the line through z and z* is perpendicular
to rand z and z* are the same distance from r but on opposite sides of r.
This is indeed the case.
If r is a straight line then, choosing Z4 = 00, equation (3.18) becomes

This gives Iz*-z31

-1m 3-Z 3
Z2- Z 3
Hence, we have (unless Z E r) that Z and z* lie in different half planes deter-
mined by r. It now follows that [z, z*] is perpendicular to r. Now suppose that r = {z: lz-al = R} (0 < R < 00). Let Z2' Z3, Z4 be
points in r; using (3.18) and Proposition 3.8 for a number of Mobius trans-
formations gives

(z*, Z2, Z3' Z4) = (z, Z2' Z3, Z4)

= (z-a, zz-a, Z3-a, Z4-a)
= (z-a, z:~~, z:~~, ;:~~)

(_R2_, =

zz-a, Z3- a, Z4- a)

z-a

= (~R2~. + a, Z2, Z3, Z4) z-a

Hence, z* = a+ R2(Z -a) -1 or (z* -a)(z -a) = R2. From this itfollows that
R2 -z.*~-...-a - ~-- > 0
z-a - Iz-al 2 '
so that z* lies on the ray {a+t(z-a): 0 < t < oJ} from a through z. Using the fact that Iz - al lz* - al = R2 we can obtain z* from z (if z lies inside r)
as in the figure below. That is: Let L be the ray from a through z. Construct

a--~z ----~------------~~z*
a line P perpendicular to L at z and at the point where P intersects r construct the tangent to r. The point of intersection of this tangent with L is the point z*. Thus, the points a and Cf) are symmetric with respect to r. 3.19 Symmetry Principle. If a Mijbius transformation T takes a circle 1'1
onto the circle 1'2 then any pair of points symmetric with respect to 1'1 are
mapped by T onto a pair of points symmetric with respect to r 2'

52

Elementary Properties and Examples of Analytic Functions

Proof Let =2, Z 3, r Z4 E 1; it follows that if z and z* are symmetric with respect to r 1 then

(Tz*, Tz2 , Tz 3 , Tz 4 ) = (z*, Z2, Z3, Z4)

= (Tz, Tz2, Tz 3 , Tz 4)
by Proposition 3.8. Hence Tz* and Tz are symmetric with respect to r 2 • •
Now we will discuss orientation for circles in Coo; this will enable us to distinguish between the "inside" and "outside" of a circle in Coo. Notice that on Coo (the sphere) there is no obvious choice for the inside and outside of a circle.
3.20 Definition. If r is a circle then an orientation for r is an ordered triple r. of points (ZI' Z2, Z3) such that each Zj is in
Intuitively, these three points give a direction to r. That is we "go"
from ZI to Z2 to Z3. If only two points were given, this would, of course, be ambiguous.
Let r = ~ and let z\> Z2' Z3 E~; also, put Tz = (z, ZI' Z2, Z3) = -az+-b .
ez+d Since T(~oo) = ~oo it follows that a, b, e, d can be chosen to be real numbers (see Exercise 8). Hence,
az+b Tz=--
ez+d
az+b lez+dl 2 • (ez+d)

Hence,

1 lez+dl 2 [aelzI 2 +bd+bez+adz]
(ad-be) 1m (z, ZI' Z2' Z3) = lez+dl 2 1m z.

Thus, {z: 1m (z, z l' Z 2, z 3) < o} is either the upper or lower half plane depending on whether (ad-be) > 0 or (ad-be) < O. (Note that ad-be is the "determinant" of T.)
Now let r be arbitrary, and suppose that z[, Z2' Z3 are on r; for any
Mobius transformation S we have (by Proposition 3.8)
{z: 1m (z, Z[, Z2' Z3) > O} = {z: 1m (Sz, SZI' SZ2, SZ3) > O}
= S-1 {z: 1m (z, SZI' SZ2, SZ3) > O}
In particular, if S is chosen so that S maps r onto ~('" then {z: 1m (z, ZI'
z 2, z 3) > O} is equal to S - 1 of either the upper or lower half plane.
If (ZI' Z2' Z3) is an orientation of r then we define the right side of r
(with respect to (ZI' Z2' Z3» to be
{z: 1m (z, ZI' Z2' Z3) > O}.

Analytic functions as mappings. Mobius transformations

53

Similarly, we define the left side of l' to be

{z: 1m (z, ZI' Z2, Z3) < O}.

The proof of the following theorem is left as an exercise.

3.21 Orientation Principle. Let 1'1 and 1'2 be two circles in Coc and let T be a Mobius tran.~formation such that T(1' 1) = 1'2' Let (Zl, Z2, Z3) be an orienta-
tion for r l' Then T takes the right side and the left side of 1\ onto the right side and left side of r 2 Ivith respect to the orientation (Tz 1, Tz 2 , Tz 3)'
Consider the orientation (l, 0, co) of R By the definition of the cross
ratio, (z, 1, 0, (0) = z. Hence, the right side of IR with respect to (1, 0, (0)
is the upper half plane. This fits our intuition that the right side lies on our
right as we walk along IR from 1 to 0 to co.
As an example consider the following problem: Find an analytic function
f: G -+ IC, where G = {z: Re z > O}, such thatf(G) = D = {z: Izl < I}. We
solve this problem by finding a Mobius transformation which takes the
imaginary axis onto the unit circle and, by the Orientation Principle, takes
G onto D (that is, we must choose this map carefully in order that it does not
n. send G onto {z: Izl > 1
If we give the imaginary axis the orientation ( - i, 0, i) then {z: Re z > O}
is on the right of this axis. In fact,

Hence, {z: 1m (z, -I, 0, i) > O} = {z: 1m (iz) > O} = {z: Re z > O}.
Giving r the orientation (-i, -1, i) we have that D lies on the right of r.

Also,

(z, - i, -1 , i) =

mentioning that eX+! = tanh (z/2).)

Let G1, G2 be open connected sets; to try to find an analytic functionJ
such thatJ(G1) = Gz we try to map both G1 and Gz onto the open unit disk. If this can be done, J can be obtained by taking the composition of one

° maps L onto the real axis (Too = 1, Ta = 0, Tb = 00). Since T must map
circles onto circles, T maps fl and f2 onto circles through and 00. That is,

T(fl ) and T(f2) are straight lines. By the use of orientation we have that T( G) = {w: - a < arg w < a} for some a > 0, or the complement of some

such closed sector. By the use of an appropriate power of z and possibly a

rotation we can map this wedge onto the right half plane. Now, composing
with the map (z - l)(z + 1)-1 gives a map of G onto D = {z:lzl < I}.

Chapter IV
Complex Integration

In this chapter results are derived which are fundamental in the study of analytic functions. The theorems presented here constitute one of the pillars of Mathematics and have far ranging applications.

§1. Riemann-Stieltjes integrals

We will begin by defining the Riemann-Stieltjes integral in order to define the integral of a function along a path in C. The discussion of this integral is by no means complete, but is limited to those results essential to a cogent exposition of line integrals.

1.1 Definition. A function y: [a, b] -+ C, for [a, b] c IR, is of bounded variation
if there is a constant M > 0 such that for any partition P = {a = to < t1 < ... < tm = b} of [a, b]

L m
v{y; P) = ly(tk)-y{tk - 1)1 ~ M.
k=l
The total variation of y, V{y), is defined by

V{y) = sup {v(y; P): P a partition of[a, b]}.

Clearly V{y) ~ M < 00. It is easily shown that y is of bounded variation if and only if Re y
and 1m yare of bounded variation. If y is real valued and is non-decreasing then .y is of bounded variation and V(y) = y(b) -y(a). (Exercise I) Other examples will be given, but first let us give some easily deduced properties of these functions.

1.2 Proposition. Let y: [a, b] -+ C be of bounded variation. Then:

Proof. Assume that y is smooth (the complete proof is easily deduced from
this). Recall that when we say that y is smooth this means y' is continuous.

Hence V(y) ::; J~ ly'(t)1 dt, so that y is of bounded variation. Since y' is continuous it is uniformly continuous; so if € > 0 is given we
can choose 81 > 0 such that Is-tl < 81 implies that ly'(s)-y'(t)1 < E. Also, we may choose 82 > 0 such that if P = {a = to < 11 < .. . <tm = b} and

The proof is left as an exercise. As was mentioned before, we will mainly be concerned with those '1 which are piecewise smooth. The following theorem says that in this case we can find jfd'1 by the methods of integration learned in calculus.

1.9 Theorem. If y is piecewise smooth and f: [a,bj-)C is continuous then
.f fdy=.C f(t)y'(l}dt.

Proof Again we only consider the case where y is smooth. Also, by
looking at the real and imaginary parts of y, we reduce the proof to the
case where '1([ a, b]) c Il\t Let e: > 0 and choose 8 > 0 such that if P = {a = to < ... < In = b} has II P II < 8 then

Combining this with inequalities (1.10) and (1.11) gives

Since € > 0 was arbitrary, this completes the proof of the theorem. III
We have already defined a path as a continuous function y: [a, b] -'). C.
If y: [a, b] -0>- C is a path then the set {y(t): a :::; t :::; b} is called the trace of y and is denoted by {y}. Notice that the trace of a path is always a compact
set. y is a rectifiable path if y is a function of bounded variation. If P is a partition of [a, b] then vCy; P) is exactly the sum of lengths of line segments
connecting points on the trace of y. To say that Y is rectifiable is to say that
Y has finite length and its length is V(y). In particular, if y is piecewise
smooth then Y is rectifiable and its length is J~ Iy'l dt.
If y: [a, b] ----,.. C is a rectifiable path with {y} c E c C and f: E --+ C is a continuous function then f 0 y is a continuous function on [a, b]. With
this in mind the following definition makes sense.

There are more examples in the exercises, but now we will prove a certain
"invariance" result which, besides being useful in computations, forms the
basis for our definition of a curve. If,,: [a, b] -~ C is a rectifiable path and 'P: [c, d) ~ [a, b) is a continuous
non·decreasing function whose image is all of [a, b) (i.e., 'P(c) = a and
!P(d) = b) then" 0 'P: [c, d) ~ C is a path with the same trace as". Moreover,

But fP is uniformly continuous on [c, d]; hence there is a.5 > 0, which can be
chosen with 8 < 8b such that IfP(s)-fP(s')1 < 82 whenever Is-s'l < 8. So if
{so < SI < ... < sn} is a partition of [c, dJ with (Sk-Sk-l) < .5 < 01 and
tk = fP(Sk), then {to :$ tl :$"':$ In} is a partition of [a, b] with (tk-f.-l) < 82 , If Sk-l :$ Uk :$ Sk and 'Tk = fP(uk) then both (1.14) and (1.15) hold.
Moreover, the right hand parts of these two differences are equal! It follows
that

Since € > 0 was arbitrary, equality is proved. • We wish to define an equivalence relation on the collection of rectifiable
paths so that each member of an equivalence class has the same trace and so that the line integral of a function continuous on this trace is the same for each path in the class. It would seem that we should define a and y to be
equivalent if a = y 0 fP for some function fP as above. However, this is not
an equivalence relation!

1.16 Definition. Let u: [c, d]-+ C and y: [a, b] -+ C be rectifiable paths. The path u is equivalent to y if there is a function fP: [c, d] -+ [a, b] which is
continuous, strictly increasing, and with fP(c) = a, fP(d) = b; such that a = yo fP. We call the function fP a change 0/ parameter.
A curve is an equivalence class of paths. The trace of a curve is the trace of anyone of its members. If/is continuous on the trace of the curve then the integral of/ over the curve is the integral of/over any member of the curve.
A curve is smooth (piecewise smooth) if and only if some one of its representatives is smooth (piecewise smooth).
Henceforward, we will not make this distinction between a curve and its representative. In fact, expressions such as "let y be the unit circle traversed once in the counter-clockwise direction" will be used to indicate a curve. The reader is asked to trust that a result for curves which is, in fact, a result only about paths will not be stated.
Let y: [a, b] -+ C be a rectifiable path and for a :$ t :$ b, let Iyl (t) be
V(y; [a, tJ). That is,

{f {l}. Iyl (t) = sup

iy(tk)-y(tk-1)1: {to,··., tn } is a partition of [a,

let y+c denote the curve defined by (y+c) (t) = y(t)+c. The following

1.17 Proposition. Let y be a rectifiable curve and suppose that I is a lunction

(c) If c E IC then JJ(z) dz = L+cf'(z-c) dz.

The proof is left as an exercise. The next result is the analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for line integrals.

1.18 Theorem. Let G be open in IC and let y be a rectifiable path in G with

(Recall that F is a primitive ofI when F' = f)

The following useful fact will be needed in the proof of this theorem.

1.19 Lemma.IJ G is an open set in C, y : [a,bj--+G is a rectifiable path, and

Proof. Case 1. Suppose G is an open disk. Since {y} is a compact set.
d= dist({ y}, aG» O. It follows that if G = B (c; r) then {y} c B (c; p) where
p = r - ~ d. The r~ason for passing to this smaller disk is that J is uniformly
continuous in B(c;p)cG. Hence without loss of generality it can be
assumed that J is uniformly continuous on G. Choose () > 0 such that
'I IJ(z)-J(w)I<E whenever Iz-wl<8. If y:[a,b]--+C then y is uniformly
continuous so there is a partition {to < < ... < tn } of [a, b1such that

F(y(a»= F(f3)- F(a) by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Case II The General Case. If f > 0 then Lemma 1.19 implies there is a
polygonal path [ from a to 13 such that IIi -- fr f/ < L But [ is piecewise
i - smooth, so by Case I Irf= F( 13) - F(a). Hence If [F( 13)- F(a)]1 < {;
since (> 0 is arbitrary, the desired equality follows. •
The use of Lemma 1.19 in the proof of Theorem 1.18 to pass from the
piecewise smooth case to the rectifiable case is typical of many proofs of
results on line integrals. We shall see applications of Lemma 1.19 in the
future.
A curve y: [a, b] ~ IC is said to be closed if yea) = y(b).

but for t fixed, <1>(s) = zi(eiS-tz)-l has <1>'(s) = -zi(eis -tz)-2(ieis)= zeis(ei'_tz)-2. Hence g'(t) = <1>(21T)-<1>(O) = 0, so g must be a constant.

The next result, although very important, is transitory. We will see a

much more general result than this-Cauchy's Integral Formula; a formula

which is one of the essential facts of the theory.

§3. Zeros of an analytic function

If p(z) and q(z) are two polynomials then it is well known that
p(z) = s (z)q(z) +r(z) where s(z) and r(z) are also polynomials and the degree
of r(z) is less than the degree of q(z). In particular, if a is such that pea) = 0 then choose (z-a) for q(z). Hence, p(z) = (z-a)s(z)+r(z) and r(z) must be a constant polynomiaL But letting z = a gives 0 = pea) ~~ rea). Thus, p(z) = (z-a)s(z). If we also have that sea) = 0 we can factor (z-a) from s(z). Continuing we get p(z) = (z-a)m fez) where 1 ::: m ::: degree of p(z), and t(z) is a polynomial such that tea) # O. Also, degree t(z) = degree
p(z)-m.
3.1 Definition. If f: G --7> C is analytic and a in G satisfies f(a) = 0 then a is a zero off of multiplicity m ;::0: 1 if there is an analytic function g: G --7> C such thatf(z) = (z-a)"'g(z) where g(a) # O.
Returning to the discussion of polynomials, we have that the multiplicity of a zero of a polynomial must be less than the degree of the polynomial. If n "-7. the degree of the polynomial p(z) and ai' ... , ak are all the distinct zeros of p(z) thenp{z) = (z_al)m t •• • (z-ak)mks(z) where s(z) is a polynomial with no zeros. Now the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that a polynomial with no zeros is constant. Hence, jf we can prove this result we will have succeeded in completely factoring p(z) into the product of first degree polynomials. The reader might be pleasantly surprised to know that after many years of studying Mathematics he is right now on the threshold of proving the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. But first it is necessary to prove a famous result about analytic functions. It is also convenient to introduce some new terminology.

3.2 Definition. An entire function is a function which is defined and analytic in the whole complex plane Co (The term "integral function" is also used.)
The following result follows from Theorem 2.8 and the fact that C contains BCO; R) for arbitrarily large R.

3.3 Proposition. Iff is an entire function then f has a power series expansion

L00

fez) =

anz"

"= 0

with infinite radius of convergence.

In light of the preceding proposition, entire functions can be considered

as polynomials of "infinite degree". So the question arises: can the theory of

polynomials be generalized to entire functions? For example, can an entire

function be factored? The answer to this is difficult and is postponed to

Section VII. 5. Another property of polynomials is that no non constant

polynomial is bounded. Indeed, if p(z) = z"+an_Izn- I + ... +ao then

limp(z) = lim z" [1+an_IZ-l+"'+aoz-n] = 00. The fact that this also

z-+OO

z-+oo

holds for entire functions is an extremely useful result.

3.4 Liouville's Theorem. IfI is a bounded entire lunction then I is constant.
Proof Suppose I/(z) 1 :0; M for all z in C. We will show that I'{z) = 0 for
all z in Co To do this use Cauchy's Estimate (Corollary 2.14). Since I is analytic in any disk B(z; R) we have that il'(z)l :0; MfR. Since R was arbi-
trary, it follows that I'(z) = 0 for each z in Co •
The reader should not be deceived into thinking that this theorem is
insignificant because it has such a short proof. We have expended a great deal of effort building up machinery and increasing our knowledge of analytic functions. We have plowed, planted, and fertilized; we shouldn't be surprised if, occasionally, something is available for easy picking.
Liouville's Theorem will be better appreciated in the following application.

3.5 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. II p(z) is a non constant polynomial
then there is a complex number a with pea) = O.

Proof Supposep(z) 1= 0 for all z and let/(z) = [p(Z)J-l; thenlis an entire function. If p is not constant then, as was shown above, lim p(z) = 00;

so lim I(z) = O. In particular, there is a number R > 0 such that I/(z) 1 < 1
z-+oo
if Izl > R. Butlis continuous on BCO; R) so there is a constant M such that I/(z) 1:0; M for Izl :0; R. Hencelis bounded and, therefore, must be constant
by Liouville's theorem. It follows that p must be constant, contradicting our
assumption. III

3.6 Corollary. If p(z) is a polynomial and aI' ... ,am are its zeros with aj
having multiplicity k j thenp(z) = c(z-alll.· ·(z-am)kmlor some constant c
and kl + ... +km is the degree 01 p.
Returning to the analogy between entire functions and polynomials, the

78

Complex Integration

reader should be warned that this cannot be taken too far. For example, if p is a polynomial and a E C then there is a number z with p(z) = a. In fact, this follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra by considering the polynomial p(z)-a. However the exponential function fails to have this property since it does not assume the value zero. (Nevertheless, we are able to show that this is the worst that can happen. That is, a function analytic

in C omits at most one value. This is known as Picard's Little Theorem and

will be proved later.) Moreover, no one should begin to make an analogy

between analytic functions in an open set G and a polynomial p defined on

C; rather, you should only think of the polynomials as defined on G.

For example, let

+z) I(z) = cos ( -1--- ,Izl < 1. 1-z

1 + z

Notice that

maps D = {z: Izl < I} onto G = {z: Re z > O}. The

so

f

in the domain of analyticity D. This is the story for the most general case.

3.7 Theorem. Let G be a connected open set and let f: G - IC be an analytic
Junction. Then. the Jollowing are equivalent statements:
(a) J=- 0;
(b) there is a point a in G such that I(O)(a) = 0 Jor each n 2:: 0;
(c) {z E G: J(z) = O} has a limit point in G.

Proof Clearly (a) implies both (b) and (c). (c) implies (b): Let a E G and a limit point of Z = {z E G: J(z) = O}, and let R > 0 be such that B(a; R) c G. Since a is a limit point of Z and J is continuous it follows that J(a) = O. Suppose there is an integer n 2:: 1 such that J(a) = /,(a) = ... = p.-Il(a) = 0 and J(o)(a) # O. Expanding J in power series about a gives that

for Iz-al < R. If

L J(z) = '" ak(z-a)k
k=n

Lro
g(z) = ak(z-al-n
k==n

then g is analytic in B(a; R), J(z) = (z-a)"g(z), and g(a) = an # O. Since g is analytic (and therefore continuous) in B(a; R) we can find an r, 0 < r <
R, such that g(z) # 0 for Iz-al < r. But since a is a limit point of Z there is a point b with I(b) = 0 and 0 < Ib-aJ < r. This gives 0 = (b-a)"g(b)
and so g(b) = 0, a contradiction. Hence no such integer n can be found; this proves part (b).
(b) implies (a): Let A = {z E G: pn)(z) = 0 for all n 2:: O}. From the hypothesis of (b) we have that A # O. We will show that A is both open

and closed in G; by the connectedness of G it will follow that A must be G
and so f == O. To see that A is closed let Z E A - and let Zk be a sequence in
A such that Z = lim Zk' Since each pHl is continuous it follows that
f(n)(z) = Iimi'n l(zk) = O. So Z E A and A is closed.
To see that A is open, let a E A and let R > 0 be such that B(a; R) c::: G.
Then fez) = ~ a.(z-a)" for Iz-al < R where a. = -1 pN)(a) = 0 for each
n! n ~ O. Hencef(z) = 0 for all z in B(a; R) and, consequently, B(a; R) c::: A. Thus A is open and this completes the proof of the theorem. II

3.8 Corollary. Iff and g are analytic on a region G then f == g iff {z E G:
fez) = g(z)} has a limit point in G. This follows by applying the preceding theorem to the analytic function
f-g·

3.9 Corollary. Iff is analytic on an open connected set G and f is not identically zero then for each a in G with f(a) = 0 there is an integer n ~ 1 and an analytic function g: G -l> C such that g(a) f= 0 and fez) = (z -a)"g(z) for all z in G. That is, each zero off has finite multiplicity.

Proof. Let n be the largest integer (2: 1) such that /(k)( a) = 0 for 0 ~ k < n 1
and define g(z) = (z - a)-"/(z) for z *- a and g(a) = -/(n)(a). Then g n!
is clearly analytic in G - {a}; to see that g is analytic in G it need only be shown to be analytic in a neighborhood of a. This is accomplished by using
the method of the proof that (c) implies (b) in the theorem. II

3.10 Corollary. Iff: G -l> C is analytic and not constant, a E G, and f(a) = 0
then there is an R > 0 such that 8(a; R) c G andf(z) f= 0for 0 < Iz - al < R.
Proof By the above theorem the zeros of f are isolated. •
There is one instance where the analogy between polynomials and analytic functions works in reverse. That is, there is a property of analytic functions which is not so transparent for polynomials.

but since the integrand is non-negative it follows that I/(a)1 = I/(a + reit)1 for all t. Moreover, since r was arbitrary, we have that I maps any disk B(a; R) c G into the circle Izl = 10(1 where 0( = I(a). But this implies that I is constant on B(a; R) (Exercise III. 3.17). In particular I(z) = 01. for Iz-al < R. According to Corollary 3.8, 1== 01.. II
According to the Maximum Modulus Theorem, a non-constant analytic function on a region cannot assume its maximum modulus; this fact is far from obvious even in the case of polynomials. The consequences of this
theorem are far reaching; some of these, along with a closer examination of the Maximum Modulus Theorem, are presented in Chapter VI. (Actually, the reader at this point can proceed to Sections VI. I and VI. 2.)

4.1 Proposition. If y: [0, I]_C is a closed rectifiable curve and a • {y} then

2~i f /'~a y

is an integer.

Proof. An easy argument using Lemma 1.19 shows that it suffices to prove

this proposition under the additional assumption that y is smooth. In this

£ case define g: [0, 1] ~ C by g(t)=

1 y'(s) y (s) -a ds

Hence, g(O) = 0 and g( I) = f y(z - a)-I dz. We also have that

So e-g(y-a) is the constant function e-g(O)(y(O)-a)=y(O)-a= e -8(1)( y( I) - a). Since y(O) = y(l) we have that e -g(1) = I or that g(I)= 2'ITik for some integer k . •

Also if y and 0 are curves defined on [0, I] with y(l) = 0(0) then y+o is the curve (y+ 0 )(1)= y(21) if 0:5 1 :5 ~ and (y+ o)(t) =0(2t-l) if ~:5 t:5 1.

4.3 Proposition. If y and 0 are closed rectifiable curves having the same initial points then (a) n(y;a)= -n(-y;a) for every a* {y}; (b) n(y+o;a)=n(y;a)+n(o;a) for every a. {y}u{o}.
Why is n(y; a) called the winding number of y about a? As was said
before if y(t)=a+e2,..;", for 0:5 1 S 1 then n(y; a)=n. In fact if Ib-al < 1
then n(y; b)=n and if Ib-al> 1 then n(y; b)=O. This can be shown directly or one can invoke Theorem 4.4 below. So at least in this case n(y; b) measures the number of times y wraps around b- with the minus sign indicating that the curve goes in the clockwise direction.

The following discussion is intuitive and mathematically imprecise.

Actually, with a little more sophistication this discussion can be corrected

and gives insight into the Argument Principle (V.3).

f 11 If y is smooth then -I (z-a) dz=

y'(t) ( ) dt.

y

0 y t -a

Taking inspiration from calculus one is tempted to write f/ z - a) -1 dz =

log[y(t) - a1l::6. Since y(l) = y(O), this would always give zero. The

difficulty lies in the fact that y( t) - a is complex valued and unless

y( t) - a lies in a region on which a branch of the logarithm can be defined,

the above inspiration turns out to be only so much hot air. In fact if y

wraps around the point a then we cannot define log( y( t) - a) since there is

no analytic branch of the logarithm defined on C - {a}.

Nevertheless there is a correct interpretation of the preceding discus-
fsion. If we think of log z = logl z I+ i arg z as defined then (z - a) - 1dz = log[ y(l) - a] -Iog[ y(O) - a] =

y
{iogi y( I) - a1- log/ y(0) - aI} + i { arg [ y( I) - a ] - arg [ y (0) - a] }.

Since the difficulty in defining logz is in choosing the correct value of
argz, we can think of the real part of the last expression as equal to zero. Since y(l)= y(O) it must be that even with the ambiguity in defining argz, arg[y(l)-a]-arg[y(O)-a] must equal an integral multiple of 2w, and furthermore this integer counts the number of times y wraps around a.
Let y be a closed rectifiable curve and consider the open set G =C -
{y}. Since {y} is compact (z:/zl>R}cG for some sufficiently large R. This says that G has one, and only one, unbounded component.

4.4 Theorem. Let y be a closed rectifiable curve in C. Then n(y;a) is
constant for a belonging to a component of G = C - { y }. A/so, n(y; a) =0 for
a belonging to the unbounded component of G.

Proof. Define f: G~C by f(a) = n( y; a). It will be shown that f is continu-
ous. If this is done then it follows that f(D) is connected for each
component D of G. But since f(G) is contained in the set of integers it follows that f(D) reduces to a single point. That is, f is constant on D.
To show that f is continuous recall that the components of G are open (Theorem II. 2.9). Fix a in G and let r = d (a, (y». If Ia - bl < <5 < ~ r then

If(a) - f(b)1 = 2~ I~[ (z- a)-I_(z - b)-I] dzl

But for la-bl<!r and Z on {y) we have that Iz-al2:r>t' and
IZ--bl>tr. It follows that If(a)-f(b)I<2-82 V(y). So if (>0 is given
1fr then, by choosing 5 to be smaller than ~ rand ('IT r 2()/2V( y), we see that j
must be continuous. (Also, see Exercise 2.3.) Now let U be the unbounded component of G. As was mentioned before
the theorem there is an R > 0 such that U::> {z: Izi > R}. If { > 0 choose a with lal > Rand Iz - al > (21f£)-1V(y) uniformly for z on {y}; then In(y; a)1 < (. That is, n(y; a) ~ 0 as a --+ 00. Since n(y; a) is constant on

U, it must be zero. •

§5. Cauchy's Theorem and Integral Formula
We have already proved Cauchy's Theorem for functions analytic in a disk: if G is an open disk then /J=O for any analytic functionj on G and any closed rectifiable curve y in G (Proposition 2.15). For which regions G does this result remalll valid? There are regions for which the result is false. For example, if G=C,-{O} andf(z)=z-I then y(t)=e il for OS IS
J 21f gives that 1 =21fi. The difficulty with C- {O} is the presence of a hole
(namely {O». In the next section it will be shown that 1/=0 for every analytic function f and every closed rectifiable curve '( in regions G that
have no "holes." In the present section we adopt a different approach. Fix a region G
and an analytic function f on G. Is there a condition on a closed rectifiable
J curve y such that I = O? The answer is furnished by the index of y with
respect to points outside G. Before presenting this result we need the following lemma. (This has already been seen in Exercise 2.3.)
5.1 Lemma. Let '( be a rectifiable curve and suppose cp is a junction defined
and continuous on {y}. For each In 2: I let Fm(z) = 1yCP(w)(w - z)-m dw for z <t {y}. Then each Fm is analytic on C- (y} and F';'(z) = mFm+ I(Z).
Proof. We first claim that each I'm is continuous. In fact, this follows in the same way that we showed that the index was continuous (see the proof of Theorem 4.4). One need only observe that, since {y} is compact, fJ! is

Proof. Define qJ: G X G--->C by qJ(z. w) = [fez) - J(w)l/(z - w) if z 1= wand qJ(z ,z) =F(z). It follows that qJ is continuous; and for each w in G,

z--->qJ(z.w) is analytic (Exercise I). Let H={wEC:n(y;w)=O}. Since

n(y; w) is a continuous integer-valued function of w, H is open. Moreover

HuG = C by the hypothesis.
Define g: C--->C by g(z) =f yqJ(Z, w)dw if z E G and g(z) =f y(w-

By Lemma 5.1 g is analytic on H and by an analogue of Leibniz's rule (for

example, see Exercise 2.2) g is analytic on G; that is, g is an entire function. But

Theorem 4.4 implies that H contains a neighborhood of 00 in Coo- Since f

Cauchy's Theorem and Integral Formula is the basic result of complex analysis. With a result that is so fundamental to an entire theory it is usual in mathematics to seek the outer limits of the theorem's validity. Are there other functions that satisfy J~f= 0 for all closed curves y? The answer is no as the following converse to Cauchy's Theorem shows.
A closed path T is said to be triangular if it is polygonal and has three sides.

5.10 Morera's Theorem. Let G be a region and let f: G~C be a continuous
function such that I Tf =0 for evel), triangular path T in G; then f is analytic
in G.

Proof. First observe that f will be shown to be analytic if it can be proved

thatf is analytic on each open disk contained in G. Hence, without loss of

generality, we may assume G to be an open disk; suppose G= R(a; R).
Use the hypothesis to prove that f has a primitive. For z in G define

F(z)= Ira.:lf. Fix Zo in G; then for any point z in G the hypothesis gives

that F(z) = I[a.:olf + I[z".:lf. Hence
