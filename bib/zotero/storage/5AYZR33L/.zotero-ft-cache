Computing Euler angles from a rotation matrix
Gregory G. Slabaugh

Abstract
This document discusses a simple technique to ﬁnd all possible Euler angles from a rotation matrix. Determination of Euler angles is sometimes a necessary step in computer graphics, vision, robotics, and kinematics. However, the solution may or may not be obvious.

Rotation matrices

We start oﬀ with the standard deﬁnition of the rotations about the three principle axes.
A rotation of ψ radians about the x-axis is deﬁned as

1 0

0

Rx(ψ) =  0 cos ψ − sin ψ  0 sin ψ cos ψ

Similarly, a rotation of θ radians about the y-axis is deﬁned as
 cos θ 0 sin θ  Ry(θ) =  0 1 0 
− sin θ 0 cos θ

Finally, a rotation of φ radians about the z-axis is deﬁned as

 cos φ − sin φ 0 

Rz(φ) =  sin φ cos φ 0 

01

The angles ψ, θ, and φ are the Euler angles.

Generalized rotation matrices
A general rotation matrix can will have the form,
 R11 R12 R13  R =  R21 R22 R23 
R31 R32 R33

This matrix can be thought of a sequence of three rotations, one about each principle axis. Since matrix multiplication does not commute, the order of the axes which one rotates about will aﬀect the result. For this analysis, we will rotate ﬁrst about the x-axis, then the y-axis, and ﬁnally the z-axis. Such a sequence of rotations can be represented as the matrix product,

R = Rz(φ)Ry(θ)Rx(ψ)

 cos θ cos φ sin ψ sin θ cos φ − cos ψ sin φ cos ψ sin θ cos φ + sin ψ sin φ 

=  cos θ sin φ sin ψ sin θ sin φ + cos ψ cos φ cos ψ sin θ sin φ − sin ψ cos φ 

− sin θ

sin ψ cos θ

cos ψ cos θ

Given a rotation matrix R, we can compute the Euler angles, ψ, θ, and φ by equating each element in R with the corresponding element in the matrix product Rz(φ)Ry(θ)Rx(ψ). This results in nine equations that can be used to ﬁnd the Euler angles.

Finding two possible angles for θ

Starting with R31, we ﬁnd

R31 = − sin θ.

This equation can be inverted to yield

θ = − sin−1(R31).

(1)

However, one must be careful in interpreting this equation. Since sin(π − θ) = sin(θ), there are actually two distinct values (for R31 = ±1) of θ that satisfy Equation 1. Therefore, both the values

θ1 = − sin−1(R31) θ2 = π − θ1 = π + sin−1(R31)

are valid solutions. We will handle the special case of R31 = ±1 later in this report. So using the R31 element of the rotation matrix, we are able to determine two possible values for θ.

Finding the corresponding angles of ψ
To ﬁnd the values for ψ, we observe that R32 = tan(ψ). R33
We use this equation to solve for ψ, as

ψ = atan2(R32, R33),

(2)

where atan2(y, x) is arc tangent of the two variables x and y. It is similar to calculating the arc tangent of y/x, except that the signs of both arguments are used to determine the quadrant of the result, which lies in the range [−π, π]. The function atan2 is available in many programming languages.
One must be careful in interpreting Equation 2. If cos(θ) > 0, then ψ = atan2(R32, R33). However, when cos(θ) < 0, ψ = atan2(−R32, −R33). A simple way to handle this is to use the equation

ψ = atan2 R32 , R33

(3)

cos θ cos θ

to compute ψ. Equation 3 is valid for all cases except when cos θ = 0. We will deal with this
special case later in this report. For each value of θ, we compute a corresponding value of ψ using Equation 3, yielding

ψ1

=

atan2

R32 , R33 cos θ1 cos θ1

(4)

ψ2

=

atan2

R32 , R33 cos θ2 cos θ2

(5)

Finding the corresponding angles of φ

A similar analysis holds for ﬁnding φ. We observe that

R21 = tan φ. R11 We solve for φ using the equation

φ = atan2 R21 , R11

(6)

cos θ cos θ

Again, this equation is valid for all cases except when cos θ = 0. We will deal with this special case later in this report. For each value of θ, we compute a corresponding value of φ using Equation 6,

φ1

=

atan2

R21 , R11 cos θ1 cos θ1

(7)

φ2

=

atan2

R21 , R11 cos θ2 cos θ2

(8)

Two solutions if cos θ = 0
For the case of cos θ = 0, we now have two triplets of Euler angles that reproduce the rotation matrix, namely
(ψ1, θ1, φ1) (ψ2, θ2, φ2) Both of these solutions will be valid.

What if cos θ = 0?
This technique described above does not work if the R31 element of the rotation matrix is 1 or −1, which corresponds to θ = −π/2 or θ = π/2, respectively, and to cos θ = 0. When we try to solve for the possible values of ψ and φ using the above technique, problems will occur, since the elements R11, R21, R32, and R33 will all be zero, and therefore Equations 3 and 6 will become
00 ψ = atan2 ,
00 00 φ = atan2 , . 00
In this case R11, R21, R32, and R33 do not constrain the values of ψ and φ. Therefore, we must use diﬀerent elements of the rotation matrix to compute the values of ψ and φ.
θ = π/2 case: Consider the case when θ = π/2. Then,
R12 = sin ψ cos φ − cos ψ sin φ = sin(ψ − φ) R13 = cos ψ cos φ + sin ψ sin φ = cos(ψ − φ) R22 = sin ψ sin φ + cos ψ cos φ = cos(ψ − φ) = R13 R23 = cos ψ sin φ − sin ψ cos φ = − sin(ψ − φ) = −R12
Any ψ and φ that satisfy these equations will be a valid solution. Using the equations for R12 and R13, we ﬁnd that
(ψ − φ) = atan2(R12, R13) ψ = φ + atan2(R12, R13)
θ = −π/2 case: Not surprisingly, a similar result holds for the case when θ = −π/2, for which
R12 = − sin ψ cos φ − cos ψ sin φ = − sin(ψ + φ) R13 = − cos ψ cos φ + sin ψ sin φ = − cos(ψ + φ) R22 = − sin ψ sin φ + cos ψ cos φ = cos(ψ + φ) = −R13 R23 = − cos ψ sin φ − sin ψ cos φ = − sin(ψ + φ) = R12
Again, using the equations for R12 and R13, we ﬁnd that
(ψ + φ) = atan2(−R12, −R13) ψ = −φ + atan2(−R12, −R13)

Figure 1: Pseudo-code for computing Euler angles from a rotation matrix. See text for details.
Either case: In both the θ = π/2 and θ = −π/2 cases, we have found that ψ and φ are linked. This phenomenon is called Gimbal lock. Although in this case, there are an inﬁnite number of solutions to the problem, in practice, one is often interested in ﬁnding one solution. For this task, it is convenient to set φ = 0 and compute ψ as described above.

Pseudo-code
We now summarize the method by providing a pseudo-code implementation in Figure 1. The code is very simple.

Example

An example that demonstrates the computation of ψ, θ, and φ from a rotation matrix is provided below.
Suppose we are asked to ﬁnd the Euler angles that produce the matrix

 .5 −.1464 .8536 

R =  .5 .8536 −.1464 

−.7071 .5

First, we ﬁnd the possible values for θ to be

=

− sin(−.7071) = 4

3π θ2 = π − θ1 = 4 Then, we ﬁnd the corresponding values of ψ to be

And we ﬁnd φ to be

=− 4

Therefore, the solutions are
πππ ,,
444 3π 3π 3π − , ,− 44 4

More than one solution?
It is interesting to note that there is always more than one sequence of rotations about the three principle axes that results in the same orientation of an object. As we have shown in this report, in the non-degenerate case of cos θ = 0, there are two solutions. For the degenerate case of cos θ = 0, an inﬁnite number of solutions exist.
As an example, consider a book laying on a table face up in front of you. Deﬁne the x-axis as to the right, the y-axis as away from you, and the z-axis up. A rotation of π radians about the y-axis will turn the book so that the back cover is now facing up. Another way to achieve the same orientation would be to rotate the book π radians about the x-axis, and then π radians about the z-axis. Thus, there is more than one way to achieve a desired rotation.

Acknowledgement
I wish to thank Sinisa Segvic, from the University of Zagreb, for providing some insights into how to reduce the number of possible solutions to two for the non-degenerate case. Also, many thanks to Tobias Ziegler from the Fraunhofer Institute for pointing out the need for negative signs on R12 and R13 in the θ = −π/2 case.
